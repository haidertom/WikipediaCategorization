'''Abstract index notation''' is a mathematical notation for [[tensor]]s and [[spinor]]s that uses indices to indicate their types, rather than their components in a particular basis.  The indices are mere placeholders, not related to any basis and, in particular, are non-numerical. Thus it should not be confused with the [[Ricci calculus]]. The notation was introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] as a way to use the formal aspects of the [[Einstein summation convention]] to compensate for the difficulty in describing [[tensor contraction|contraction]]s and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while preserving the explicit [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance]] of the expressions involved.

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]], and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; its [[dual space|dual]].  Consider, for example, an order-2 [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor 
&lt;math&gt;h\in V^*\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Then ''h'' can be identified with a [[bilinear form]] on ''V''.  In other words, it is a function of two arguments in ''V'' which can be represented as a pair of ''slots'':

: &lt;math&gt;h = h(-,-).&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation is merely a ''labelling'' of the slots with Latin letters, which have no significance apart from their designation as labels of the slots (i.e., they are non-numerical):

: &lt;math&gt;h = h_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[tensor contraction]] (or trace) between two tensors is represented by the repetition of an index label, where one label is contravariant (an ''upper index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V'') and one label is covariant (a ''lower index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).  Thus, for instance,

: &lt;math&gt;{t_{ab}}^b&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace of a tensor ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; over its last two slots.  This manner of representing tensor contractions by repeated indices is formally similar to the [[Einstein summation convention]].  However, as the indices are non-numerical, it does not imply summation: rather it corresponds to the abstract basis-independent trace operation (or duality pairing) between tensor factors of type ''V'' and those of type ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Abstract indices and tensor spaces ==

A general homogeneous tensor is an element of a [[tensor product]] of copies of ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, such as

:&lt;math&gt;V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Label each factor in this tensor product with a Latin letter in a raised position for each contravariant ''V'' factor, and in a lowered position for each covariant ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; position.  In this way, write the product as

:&lt;math&gt;V^a V_b V_c V^d V_e&lt;/math&gt;

or, simply

:&lt;math&gt;{{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e.&lt;/math&gt;

The last two expressions denote the same object as the first.  Tensors of this type are denoted using similar notation, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;{{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \in {{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e = V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

==Contraction==
{{See also|Tensor contraction}}
In general, whenever one contravariant and one covariant factor occur in a tensor product of spaces, there is an associated ''contraction'' (or ''trace'') map.  For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first two spaces of the tensor product.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V^*\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first and last space.

These trace operations are signified on tensors by the repetition of an index.  Thus the first trace map is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{ac}}^d}_e&lt;/math&gt;

and the second by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_a.&lt;/math&gt;

==Braiding==
To any tensor product on a single vector space, there are associated [[braided monoidal category|braiding maps]].  For example, the braiding map
:&lt;math&gt; \tau_{(12)} : V\otimes V \rightarrow V\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;
interchanges the two tensor factors (so that its action on simple tensors is given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_{(12)} (v \otimes w) = w \otimes v&lt;/math&gt;).  In general, the braiding maps are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the [[symmetric group]], acting by permuting the tensor factors.  Here, we use &lt;math&gt;\tau_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to denote the braiding map associated to the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (represented as a product of disjoint [[cyclic permutation]]s).

Braiding maps are important in [[differential geometry]], for instance, in order to express the [[Bianchi identity]].  Here let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the Riemann tensor, regarded as a tensor in &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V&lt;/math&gt;.  The first Bianchi identity then asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;R+\tau_{(123)}R+\tau_{(132)}R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation handles braiding as follows.  On a particular tensor product, an ordering of the abstract indices is fixed (usually this is a [[lexicographic order]]ing).  The braid is then represented in notation by permuting the labels of the indices.  Thus, for instance, with the Riemann tensor
:&lt;math&gt;R={R_{abc}}^d\in {V_{abc}}^d = V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V,&lt;/math&gt;
the Bianchi identity becomes
:&lt;math&gt;{R_{abc}}^d+{R_{cab}}^d+{R_{bca}}^d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Antisymmetrization and Symmetrization ==
A general tensor may be antisymmetrized or symmetrized, and there is according notation.

We demonstrate the notation by example. Let's antisymmetrize the type-(0,3) tensor &lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric group on three elements.

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{[abc]} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} (-1)^{\text{sgn}(\sigma)} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we may symmetrize:

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{(abc)} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art''' (1969-1985) was a [[magazine]] published by the [[conceptual art]]ists of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Involving more than 20 artists, in the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and covering almost 20 years production, it is one of the most extensive artworks of conceptual art, and is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and [[contemporary art]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't understand quite a good deal of what is said by Art-Language, but I admire the investigatory energies, the tireless spade-work (not calling one one), the full commitment to the reestablishment of a valid language by which to discuss art and the occasional humour in their writings. The chaos in their reasons fascinates me, but it is also irritating to be unequipped to evaluate their work. - ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object'', [[Lucy R. Lippard]], 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=t2nwiTwd6fwC&amp;q=Art-Language#v=snippet&amp;q=Art-Language&amp;f=false ''Six Years: The Dematerialisation of the Art Object'' - Lucy R. Lippard, New York Praeger, 1973, p151]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Art &amp; Language}}
The name Art &amp; Language is derived form the journal Art-Language that was published by Art &amp; Language Press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml ''Paying Hommage to Art &amp; Language revolutionaries'', BBC, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nts.live/artists/65770-art-language NTS Live, Art &amp; Language]&lt;/ref&gt; Art &amp; Language Press had been created in 1968 to give a publication arm to the ongoing conversation between the four founders of Art &amp; Language (Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell), and also between Art &amp; Language and other artists in America or other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt8489r9cw/entire_text/ Art &amp; Language New York Archives, The Getty Museum, Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/11494/1/ETD_Template_Robert__Bailey.pdf ''Art &amp; Language'', Robert Bailey, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong connections have been made over time between the British artists of Art &amp; Language and American artists, in 1966, Michael Baldwin who has just been rewarded a Prize from the ''Northern Young Contemporaries'', spent the money on a trip to New York, to meet and discuss with [[Donald Judd]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], and [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]. In November 1967, thanks to [[Robert Smithson]], ''arts magazine'', a New York-based magazine, published for the first time a text-work of Art &amp; Language (before the foundation of the group) titled ''Remarks on Air-Conditioning, an Extravaganza of Blandness'' written by Michael Baldwin. It is interesting to note Michael Baldwin is presented as an English writer and an artist concerned with the non-exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Remarks on Air-Conditioning An Extravaganza of Blandness'', Michael Baldwin, arts magazine, November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=P1gqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT153&amp;lpg=PT153&amp;dq=Art-Language+journal+of+conceptual+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ATzAqpYGKQ&amp;sig=iUEjz5feOk8mlWwmeC3Fsl5hgyI&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjChMDNjZrdAhWMCsAKHajNB6w4PBDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Art-Language%20journal%20of%20conceptual%20art&amp;f=false ''Art &amp; Language International'', Robert Bailey, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, ''Art Press'',  was produced in New York by Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden. In it they published their own text-works as well as items by [[Adrian Piper]], [[Sol LeWitt]] and [[Stephen Kaltenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftmatrix.com/july69lewitt.html ''July 1969'' - Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden, Art Press, The Society for Theoretical Art and Analyses, New York, July 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Art-Language===
Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art was published by [[Art &amp; Language|Art &amp; Language Press]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0468760&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP ''Art-Language'', Centre Pompidou.]&lt;/ref&gt; it is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flashartonline.com/article/art-language/ ''Art &amp; Language The Unfinished Legacy'', Fernando Frances, Flash Art, February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/art_market/6-most-important-artist-run-magazines-53346 6 most important artist run magazines, Maya Harakawa, December 2015, artspace.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arthist.net/archive/16167  Looking at Art_Language]&lt;/ref&gt; Art &amp; Language Press was founded at the same time as an art practice under the name Art &amp; Language in 1968 by four artists, Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, Harold Hurrell, and David Bainbridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoartmagazine.com/2010/02/art-language-comes-to-rhona-hoffman-gallery/ Art &amp; Language comes to Rhona Hoffman]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the editors of the first volume published in May 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://edcat.net/item/art-language-vol-1-no-1-may-1969/  Art-Language Vol.1 Nr.1]&lt;/ref&gt;
Terry Atkinson spent the summer of 1969 with Joseph Kosuth in New York, and in August of that year, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor of Art-Language.&lt;ref&gt;''Status and priority'' - Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell, Studio International 179, January 1970&lt;/ref&gt; From the second volume, the journal was edited both in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/509748?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title= Reflections on conceptual art Voices Off, Critical Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt; Essays by members of Art &amp; Language appeared regularly in Studio International, and in February 1970, the general editor and art critic [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] published an article titled ''Notes Towards Art Work'', arguing that ″The only alternative to criticism is art″.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes Towards Art Work'' - Charles Harrison, Studio International 180, February 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, having resigned from Studio International, he became the general editor of Art-Language. In 1971, Terry Atkinson had also met Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden in New York in 1969 and, having published a number of text-works as the ''Society for Theoretical Art and Analyses'', they joined with Art-Language that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html ''Art &amp; Language'', leftmatrix.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''We are cell arent we?: Art &amp; Language and the Documenta Index - William Wood, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, October 1992&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in Coventry, David Rushton, Philip Pilkington and Graham Howard, three ''Art Theory'' students of Baldwin, Bainbridge and Atkinson began to work under the name of Art &amp; Language. In that year ''Coventry College of Art'' was transformed into the ''Faculty of Art and Design'', part of ''Lanchester Polytechnic''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/gallery/coventry-university-celebrates-175th-birthday-14690150 ''Coventry University celebrates 175th Birthday'', Laura Hartley, Coventry telegraph, May 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; The new dean of the faculty, saw it as his task to bring an end to the ''Art-Theory'' course.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1971, the Art-Theory course was dismantled by arbitrary exercise of power and Baldwin and Bainbridge dismissed along with some other members of the part-time staff. Atkinson remained. His presence enabled ther authorities in charge to claim some credibility for the ruins ... Art &amp; Language found itself in exile from any official academic or educational context … Art &amp; Language work in all its forms was addressed first and foremost to ‘art’ as discourse, rather than to the enlargement of the extensive category of art objects - &lt;ref&gt;''A Provisional History of Art &amp; Language'', Charles Harrison and Fred Orton, Editions E. Fabre, Paris 1982, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Michael Baldwin and Terry Atkinson wrote an extensive 25 pages critical essay on Art education in an article titled ''Art Teaching'' and published it in Art-Language Volume 1 Number 4. In 1973, Atkinson eventually resigned.&lt;blockquote&gt;In virtue of this prototype of present art-school sensibility, William Morris and his followers have helped spawn the resolute craftsmanship bias in British art education in the earlier part of the century. Of course this is not to say that Morris' influence stopped at Lowestoft and the Wash; the Bauhaus founders had a good look at Morris -and there may yet be a case for looking at the Bauhaus as the definitive example in showing how ″fine art″ and ″design″ do diverge.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Teaching'', Terry Atkinson and Michael Baldwin, Art-Language Volume 1 Number 4, November 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  While, in 1972, the activity of Art &amp; Language was exclusively textual and its identity somehow confounded with Art-Language, the production of the ''Index 01'', for the [[Documenta 5]], under the name of ''The Art &amp; Language Institute'' marked a shift.&lt;ref&gt;''We are cell aren't we?: Art &amp; Language and the Documenta Index - William Wood, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, October 1992&lt;/ref&gt; From Art-Language Volume 2 Number 3, the journal became anonymous and the authorship of the texts weren't given anymore to individuals. The journal continued to be published until 1985, and the implications of the indexes of 1972-3 persisted in bearing in various ways – and to a greater and lesser extent upon its content.
A new series appeared in 1994, continuing for 3 issues until 1999. Apart from Baldwin, Ramsden and Harrison, into whose hands the work of Art &amp; Language had been taken by 1976, its contributors included Philip Pilkington and Paul Wood.

===Editors===
The first number was edited by Art &amp; Language, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor from August 1969 until 1972, and Art &amp; Language remained the English editors. In 1971, Charles Harrison became the general editor of Art-Language, and he remained so until the last volume.

===Distributors===      
* United Kingdom: Art &amp; Language, [[Lisson Gallery]], Robert Self Publications, Arts Bibliographic.
* United States of America: Joseph Kosuth, Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden, [[Kathryn Bigelow]], [[Printed Matter, Inc.]].

==Complete list and contributors==
The authors of the articles are named in the first 7 issues of the journal, and from 1974, all texts are collectively attributed to Art &amp; Language. But, since during the internal problems that the group encountered between 1975 and 1976, the name Art &amp; Language remained in the hands of Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison, it is logical to give them the authorship of the texts from Volume 3 Number 4.

==Critical review==
*Daniel Buren: &lt;blockquote&gt;To lend support to their pseudo-cultural references and to their bluffing games, with a complacent display of questionable scholarship, certain artists attempt to explain what conceptual art would be, could be  or should be -thus making a conceptual work. There is no lack of vulgarity in pretense. In place of unpretentious inquiry we are subjected to a hodgepodge of explanations and justifications which serve as obfuscation in the attempt to convince us of the existence of thought. For these, conceptual art has become ''verbiage art''. They are no longer living in the twentieth century but wish to revive the eighteenth.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Conceptuel Formes Conceptuelles'' - Christian Schlatter, Galerie 1900-2000, Paris, 1990, p410-433&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Jeff Wall: &lt;blockquote&gt;By putting forward its forgotten card-files and print-outs (its caskets of information) conceptualism recapitulates a kind of Mallarméan aesthetic: social subjects are presented as enigmatic hieroglyphs and given the authority of the crypt. The identification of bureaucracy, publicity and academicism with cryptic utterances expresses an awareness of the participation of universities and bureaucracies in a corporate death-machine, an awareness which of course animated the student movement. - Jeff Wall, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''A Draft for Dan Graham's Kammerspiel'', Jeff Wall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Lucy Lippard: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don't understand quite a good deal of what is said by Art-Language, but I admire the investigatory energies, the tireless spade-work (not calling one one), the full commitment to the reestablishment of a valid language by which to discuss art and the occasional humour in their writings. The chaos in their reasons fascinates me, but it is also irritating to be unequipped to evaluate their work. I don't know how it is or if it is evaluated by adepts in philosophy as philosophy, but I find it infuriating to have to take them on faith. - ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object'', [[Lucy R.

'''Automatic Clustering Algorithm''' refers to algorithms that can perform clustering without prior knowledge of the data sets. In contrast with other [[Cluster Analysis]] techniques, automatic clustering algorithms can determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points.

== Centroid-Based Clustering ==
Given a set of ''n'' objects, centroid-based algorithms create ''k'' partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that ''k≤n''. A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.  

Automated selection of ''k'' in a [[K-means clustering|''K''-means clustering algorithm]], one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a big problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the [[Elbow method (clustering)|elbow method]]. It consists of running ''k''-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of ''k'' will be on the "elbow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bl.ocks.org/rpgove/0060ff3b656618e9136b|title=Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering|website=bl.ocks.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another method that modifies the ''k''-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the ''G''-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, ''k'' is increased until each ''k''-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and it does not set limits for the covariance of the data.&lt;ref&gt;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2526-learning-the-k-in-k-means.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connectivity-Based Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering) ==
Connectivity-Based Clustering or [[Hierarchical clustering|Hierarchical Clustering]] is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects. Hierarchical models can either be divisive—where partitions are built from the entire data set available—or agglomerating—where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/introducing-clustering-ii-clustering-algorithms.html|title=Introducing Clustering II: Clustering Algorithms - GameAnalytics|date=2014-05-20|work=GameAnalytics|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it comes with many problems. For instance, it is sensitive to noise, to fluctuations in the data set, and it is more difficult to automate.  

Methods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms&lt;ref&gt;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19123336.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach, followed by the building up of a descriptive function, which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation (an option not found in classical HCA). This method includes the two following steps: outliers are removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allows expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-15|title=Improving hierarchical cluster analysis: A new method with outlier detection and automatic clustering|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169743907000068|journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=208–217|doi=10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.01.005|issn=0169-7439|last1=Almeida|first1=J.A.S.|last2=Barbosa|first2=L.M.S.|last3=Pais|first3=A.A.C.C.|last4=Formosinho|first4=S.J.|hdl=10316/5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[BIRCH]] (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Tian|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=Raghu|last3=Livny|first3=Miron|last4=Zhang|first4=Tian|last5=Ramakrishnan|first5=Raghu|last6=Livny|first6=Miron|date=1996-06-01|title=BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases, BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233269.233324,%20http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=235968.233324|journal=ACM SIGMOD Record|volume=25|issue=2|pages=103, 103–114, 114|doi=10.1145/235968.233324|issn=0163-5808}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it still has limitations because it requires the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserve the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the use had to input the cluster count, and improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces supercluster splitting with relatively high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Variations on the Clustering Algorithm BIRCH|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579617300151|journal=Big Data Research|language=en|volume=11|pages=44–53|doi=10.1016/j.bdr.2017.09.002|issn=2214-5796|last1=Lorbeer|first1=Boris|last2=Kosareva|first2=Ana|last3=Deva|first3=Bersant|last4=Softić|first4=Dženan|last5=Ruppel|first5=Peter|last6=Küpper|first6=Axel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Density-Based Clustering ==
Unlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, [[density-based clustering]] algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres. The Density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/how-density-based-clustering-works.htm|title=How Density-based Clustering works—ArcGIS Pro {{!}} ArcGIS Desktop|website=pro.arcgis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is [[DBSCAN]] and uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method [[OPTICS algorithm|OPTICS]] creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density. 

These methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7978726|title=An algorithm for automatic recognition of cluster centers based on local density clustering - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' 

In the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA’s alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6252874|title=AutoClustering: An estimation of distribution algorithm for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the year 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''&lt;ref name="Dasmann1968"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond Fredric |last=Dasmann|title=A Different Kind of Country|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DgM2jwEACAAJ}}|year=1968|publisher=Collier Books|isbn=978-0-02-072810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term "biological diversity".

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]&lt;ref name="WilsonSciences1988"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.O. |last1=Wilson|title=Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DSGF1xQBYi8C}}|date=1 January 1988|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-03739-6}} [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154719/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of that forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy-makers|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKnimgEACAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56481-6}} Annex 6, Glossary. Used as source by [http://www.biodiv.be/glossary_keywords/B "Biodiversity", Glossary of terms related to the CBD], [[Belgium|Belgian]] Clearing-House Mechanism. Retrieved 2006-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders and concerned citizens.

A similar term in the United States is ''"natural heritage."'' It pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- I've never come across this term--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/|title=Massachusetts Natural Heritage &amp; Endangered Species Program|last=NHESP|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]]. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species and [[ecosystems]] of a region".&lt;ref name="Larsson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:

* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|accessdate = 2015-12-22|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;

The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

One textbook's definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization".&lt;ref name="GastonSpicer2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels. However, [[tetrapod]] (terrestrial [[vertebrates]]) taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation.&lt;!-- what does this even mean???--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry  | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/22/rsbl.2009.1024.abstract| volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–7 | pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally.  [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages =  1771–1792 |format=PDF | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the [[fractal]] biodiversity") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2016). The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. Biologia, 71(6), 669-672.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises up to three moving towards the [[equator]].

===Hotspots===
A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | url = | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages =  1098–1101 |format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. [[Selection bias]] amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. [[Gilbert White]] succinctly observed of his [[Selborne|Selborne, Hampshire]] ''"all nature is so full, that that&lt;!--"that" is correct--&gt; district produces the most variety which is the most examined."''&lt;ref name="White1887"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gilbert |last=White|title=The Natural History of Selborne: With A Naturalist's Calendar &amp; Additional Observations|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=q7UOQQAACAAJ}}|year=1887|chapter=letter xx|publisher=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]]. The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |accessdate=2009-06-21 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started out poor, became richer over time - Welcome to Bio-X|website=biox.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–94 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in his ''Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory'',  [[Roberto Cazzolla Gatti]] proposed that species themselves are the architects of biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available niches in a given ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2011). Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why. Theoretical Biology Forum, 104(1), 35-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study led to the idea that biodiversity is [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., &amp; Kauffman, S. (2017). Biodiversity is autocatalytic. Ecological Modelling, 346, 70-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[ecosystem]] of interdependent [[species]] can be, therefore, considered as an [[Emergent properties|emergent]] [[autocatalytic set]] (a self-sustaining network of mutually "[[catalytic]]" entities), where one (group of) species enables the existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in the same ecosystem.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

These services come in three flavors:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems"&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point.
* The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato blight]] of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million. It was the result of planting only two potato varieties, both vulnerable to the blight, ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', which arrived in 1845&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems" /&gt;

This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific Reports | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our [[atmosphere]] and [[water supply]]. Biodiversity is directly involved in [[water purification]], recycling [[nutrient]]s and providing fertile soils.

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name="LivingPlanetReport2014"&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |accessdate=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and ''vice versa''.

===Introduced and invasive species===
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
[[File:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3=[[Dobson, Andrew P.]] |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J.

Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its [[gene pool]]. This problem is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of [[gene flow]] is normal adaptation and not all [[gene]] and [[genotype]] constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | year = 1996 | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = Daniel | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | pages = 83–109 | jstor = 2097230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PottsBarbour2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bradley M. |last1=Potts|first2=Robert C.|last2= Barbour|first3=Andrew B. |last3=Hingston|title=Genetic Pollution from Farm Forestry Using Eucalypt Species and Hydrids: A Report for the RIRDC/L &amp; WA/FWPRDC Joint Venture Agroforestry Program|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PyQIOAAACAAJ}}|year=2001|publisher=RIRDC|isbn=978-0-642-58336-9 |issn=1440-6845}}

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.&lt;ref name="bulletin28"&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"; ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified organism]]s contain genetic material that is altered through [[genetic engineering]].

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name="bulletin28" /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801074239/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.ht…|date=1 August 2012|archivedate=1 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]].
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;via tree nurseries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
*Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Protected areas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dolomitipark.it/doc_pdf/parchi.sola.terra/07.ProtectedAreas_Biodiversity.pdf|title=Protected Areas and Biodiversity: An Overview of Key Issues|last=Mulongoy|first=Kalemani Jo|last2=Chape|first2=Stuart|publisher=CBD Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC|year=2004|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, UK|pages=15 and 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|pmid=30213888|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National parks===
{{Main|National park}}
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
[[Wildlife sanctuary|Wildlife sanctuaries]] aim only at conservation of species and have the following features:

#The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
#The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
#Private ownership may be allowed.
#[[Forestry]] and other usages can also be permitted.

===Forest reserves===
The [[forest]]s play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:

#They are large inaccessible forests.
#Many of these are unoccupied.
#They are ecologically and economically less important.

====Steps to conserve the forest cover====
{{see|forest cover}}
#An extensive [[reforestation]]/[[afforestation]] program should be followed.
#Alternative [[environment-friendly]] sources of fuel energy such as [[biogas]] other than wood should be used.
#Loss of biodiversity due to [[forest fire]] is a major problem, immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
#[[Overgrazing]] by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
#Hunting and [[poaching]] should be banned.

===Zoological parks===
In [[zoological park]]s or zoos, live animals are kept for public [[recreation]], education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities, provide opportunities for threatened species to [[captive breeding|breed in captivity]] and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care. Zoos play a major role in creating [[environmental awareness|awareness]] about the need to conserve nature.

===Botanical gardens===
In [[botanical garden]]s, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown outdoors or under glass in [[greenhouse]]s and conservatories. In addition, a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or [[herbarium]] and such facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental or research plantings.

==Resource allocation==
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=conservationists-triage-determine-which-endangered-species-to-save Conservationists Use Triage to Determine which Species to Save and Not; Like battlefield medics, conservationists are being forced to explicitly apply triage to determine which creatures to save and which to let go] 23 July 2012 ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones-Walters | first1 = L. | last2 = Mulder | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1016/j.jnc.2009.06.001 | title = Valuing nature: The economics of biodiversity | journal = Journal for Nature Conservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–247 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | url=http://mdvnaturalist.com/images/econmics_of_biodiversity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|right|A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], [[Australia]] while continuing to allow visitor access.]]

===International===
* United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (1992) and [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]];
* Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]);
* [[Ramsar Convention]] (Wetlands);
* [[Bonn Convention]] on Migratory Species;
* [[World Heritage Convention]] (indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats)
* Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
* Bilateral agreements such as the [[Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement]].

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.

India passed the [[Biological Diversity Act]] in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

===Taxonomic and size relationships===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x | author = Wilson Edward O | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial.

== Diversity study (botany) ==
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as ''simple sequence repeats'' (SSR) were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild relatives.

In the case of [[cowpea]], a study conducted to assess the level of genetic diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and revealing the center of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunkanmi|first=Liasu Adebayo|date=|title=Genetic diversity of cowpea and its wild relatives|url=|journal=Unilag SPGS (Thesis &amp; Dissertation 1970-2012)|volume=|pages=144–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological motion perception''' is the act of perceiving the fluid unique motion of a biological agent.  The phenomenon was first documented by Swedish perceptual psychologist, Gunnar Johansson, in 1973.&lt;ref name=Johansson1973&gt;{{cite journal |title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis|author=Johansson|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1973|volume=14|pages=201–214|doi=10.3758/bf03212378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many [[brain]] areas involved in this process, some similar to those used to perceive [[face]]s. While humans complete this process with ease, from a [[computational neuroscience]] perspective there is still much to be learned as to how this complex perceptual problem is solved. One tool which many research studies in this area use is a display [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] called a point light walker. Point light walkers are coordinated moving dots that simulate biological motion in which each dot represents specific joints of a human performing an action.

Currently a large topic of research, many different models of biological motion/perception have been proposed. The following models have shown that both [[Visual appearance|form]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]] are important components of biological motion perception. However, to what extent each of the components play is contrasted upon the models.

==Neuroanatomy==

Research in this area seeks to identify the specific brain regions or circuits responsible for processing the information which the [[visual system]] perceives in the world. And in this case, specifically recognizing motion created by biological agents.

===Single Cell Recording===

The most precise research is done using [[single-unit recording|single-cell recordings]] in the primate brain. This research has yielded areas important to motion perception in primates such as area MT (middle [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[visual cortex|visual]] area), also referred to as V5, and area MST ([[medial superior temporal area]]). These areas contain cells characterized as direction cells, expansion/contraction cells, and rotation cells, which react to certain classes of movement.&lt;ref name="Born R., Bradley D." &gt;{{cite journal |title=Structure and Function of Visual Area MT|author=Born, Bradley|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=28|pages=157–189|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.26.041002.131052|pmid=16022593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanaka and Saito" &gt;{{cite journal |title=Analysis of Motion of the Visual Field by Direction, Expansion/Contraction, and Rotation Cells Clustered in the Dorsal Part of the Medial Superior Temporal Area of the Macaque Monkey
|authors=Tanaka and Saito|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|year=1989|volume=62|pages=626–641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van Essen and Gallant"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neural Mechanisms of Form and Motion Processing in the Primate Visual System|author=van Essen and Gallant|journal=Neuron|year=1994|volume=13|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/0896-6273(94)90455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimaging===

Additionally, research on human participants is being conducted as well. While single-cell recording is not conducted on humans, this research uses [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], [[positron emission tomography|PET]], [[electroencephalography|EEG]]/[[event-related potential|ERP]] to collect information on what brain areas become active when executing biological motion perception tasks, such as viewing point light walker stimuli. Areas uncovered from this type of research are the dorsal visual pathway, [[extrastriate body area]], [[fusiform gyrus]], [[superior temporal sulcus]], and [[premotor cortex]]. The [[two-streams hypothesis|dorsal visual pathway]] (sometimes referred to as the “where” pathway), as contrasted with the [[two-streams hypothesis|ventral visual pathway]] (“what” pathway), has been shown to play a significant role in the perception of motion cues. While the ventral pathway is more responsible for form cues.&lt;ref name="Grossman et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain Areas Involved in the Perception of Biological Motion|author=Grossman|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2000|volume=12|pages=711–720|doi=10.1162/089892900562417|pmid=11054914|issue=5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ptito et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Separate neural pathways for contour and biological-motion cues in motion-defined animal shapes|author=Ptito|journal=NeuroImage|year=2003|volume=19|pages=246–252|doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00082-x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cortical Area Selective for Visual Processing of the Human Body|author=Downing|journal=Science|year=2001|volume=293|pages=2470–2473|doi=10.1126/science.1063414|pmid=11577239|issue=5539|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadjikhani and Gelder"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing Fearful Body Expressions activates the Fusiform Cortex and Amygdala|authors=Hadjikhani and Gelder|journal=Current Biology|year=2003|volume=13|pages=2201–2205|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2003.11.049|pmid=14680638|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saygin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saygin |first1=A.P. |editor-last=Johnson &amp; Shiffrar |editor-first=K. |title=Biological motion perception and the brain: Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies|publisher=Oxford Series in Visual Cognition |year=2012 |pages=371–389 |chapter=Chapter 21: Sensory and motor brain areas supporting biological motion perception: neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Point-Light Biological Motion Perception Activates Human Premotor Cortex|author=Saygin|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=24|pages=6181–6188|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.0504-04.2004|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychological Damage===

Valuable information can also be learned from cases where a patient has suffered from some sort of [[neurology|neurological]] damage and consequently loses certain functionalities of neural processing. One patient with bilateral [[lesion]]s that included the human homologue of area MT, lost their ability to see biological motion when the stimulus was embedded in noise, a task which the average observer is able to complete. Another study on [[stroke]] patients sustaining lesions to their superior temporal and premotor [[frontal lobe|frontal]] areas showed deficits in their processing of biological motion stimuli, thereby implicating these areas as important to that perception process. A [[case study]] conducted on a patient with bilateral lesions involving the posterior [[visual cortex|visual pathways]] and effecting the lateral [[parietal-temporal-occipital]] cortex struggled with early motion tasks, and yet was able to perceive the biological motion of a point light walker, a higher-order task. This may be due to the fact that area V3B and area KO were still intact, suggesting their possible roles in biological motion perception.&lt;ref name="Vaina et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intact "biological motion" and "structure from motion" perception in a patient with impaired motion mechanisms|author=Vaina|journal=Visual Neuroscience|year=1990|volume=5|pages=353–369|doi=10.1017/s0952523800000444|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saygin2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Superior temporal and premotor brain areas necessary for biological motion perception|author=Saygin|journal=Brain|year=2007|volume=130|pages=2452–2461|doi=10.1093/brain/awm162|pmid=17660183|issue=Pt 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaina and Giese"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biological motion: Why some motion impaired stroke patients "can" while others "can’t" recognize it? A computational explanation|authors=Vaina &amp; Giese|journal=Journal of Vision|year=2002|volume=2|pages=332|doi=10.1167/2.7.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological Motion Perception Models==

===Cognitive Model of Biological Motion Form (Lange &amp; Lappe, 2006)&lt;ref name="Lange and Lappe"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Model of Biological Motion Perception from Configural Form Cues
|authors=Lange and Lappe|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=26|pages=2894–2906|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4915-05.2006|pmid=16540566}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

====Background====
The relative roles of form cues compared to motion cues in the process of perceiving biological motion is unclear. Previous research has not untangled the circumstances under which local motion cues are needed or only additive. This model looks at how form-only cues can replicate psychophysical results of biological motion perception.

====Model====
''Template Creation''

Same as below. See 2.2.2 Template Generation

''Stage 1''

The first stage compares stimulus images to the assumed library of upright human walker templates in memory. Each dot in a given stimulus frame is compared to the nearest limb location on a template and these combined, weighted distances are outputted by the function:

::&lt;math&gt;F_{tc}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n e^  \left (\frac{(\mu_{tc}-p_i(t))^2}{2X\sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; p_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the position of a particular stimulus dot and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{tc}&lt;/math&gt; represents the nearest limb position in the template. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; represents the size of the receptor field to adjust for the size of the stimulus figure.

The best fitting template was then selected by a [[winner-take-all in action selection|winner-takes-all]] mechanism and entered into a [[leaky integrator]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\delta u_{1,2}(t)}{\delta t} = -u_{1,2}+i_{1,2}+w_+f(u_{1,2}(t))- w_-f(u_{2,1}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_-&lt;/math&gt; are the weights for lateral excitation and inhibition, respectively, and the activities &lt;math&gt;u_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; provide the left/right decision for which direction the stimulus is facing.

''Stage 2''

The second stage attempts to use the [[temporality|temporal]] order of the stimulus frames to change the expectations of what frame would be coming next. The equation

::&lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\delta v_{1,2}(t)}{\delta t} = -v_{1,2}(t) + w_{m,n}u(t) &lt;/math&gt;

takes into account [[top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] input from stage 1 &lt;math&gt;(u)&lt;/math&gt;, the activities in decision stage 2 for the possible responses &lt;math&gt;(v_{1,2})&lt;/math&gt;, and weights the difference between selected frame &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and previous frame &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

''Implications''

This model highlights the abilities of form-related cues to detect biological motion and orientation in a neurologically feasible model. The results of the Stage 1 model showed that all behavioral data could be replicated by using form information alone - global motion information was not necessary to detect figures and their orientation. This model shows the possibility of the use of form cues, but can be criticized for a lack of [[ecological validity]]. Humans do not detect biological figures in static environments and motion is an inherent aspect in upright figure recognition.

===Action Recognition by Motion Detection in Posture Space (Theusner, Lussanet, and Lappe, 2014)===

====Overview====
Old models of [[biological motion]] [[Motion perception|perception]] are concerned with [[Optical motion tracking|tracking]] joint and limb motion relative to one another over time.&lt;ref name="Johansson1973"/&gt; However, recent experiments in biological motion perception have suggested that motion information is unimportant for action recognition.&lt;ref name=Beintema&amp;Lappe2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion without local image motion|authors=Beintema and Lappe|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=2002|volume=99|pages=5661–5663|doi=10.1073/pnas.082483699|pmc=122827}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model shows how biological motion may be perceived from sequences of [[Posture (psychology)|posture]] recognition, rather than from the direct perception of motion information. An experiment was conducted to test the validity of this model, in which subjects are presented moving point-light and stick-figure walking [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Each frame of the walking stimulus is matched to a posture template, the progression of which is recorded on a 2D posture–time [[Plot (graphics)|plot]] that implies motion recognition.

====Posture Model====
''Template Generation''

Posture templates for stimulus matching were constructed with motion tracking data from nine people walking.&lt;ref name=Beintema2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion from limited lifetime stimuli |vauthors=Beintema JA, Georg K, Lappe M |journal=Percept Psychophys |year=2006 |volume=68 |pages=613–624 |doi=10.3758/bf03208763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian coordinate system|3D coordinates]] of the twelve major joints (feet, knees, hips, hands, elbows, and shoulders) were tracked and [[Interpolation|interpolated]] between to generate limb motion. Five sets of 2D projections were created: leftward, frontward, rightward, and the two 45° intermediate orientations. Finally, projections of the nine walkers were [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] for walking speed (1.39 seconds at 100 frames per cycle), height, and hip location in posture space. One of the nine walkers was chosen as the walking stimulus, and the remaining eight were kept as templates for matching.

''Template Matching''

Template matching is computed by simulating posture selective [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] as described by &lt;ref name=Lange&amp;Lappe2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=A model of biological motion perception from configural form cues |vauthors=Lange J, Lappe M |journal=J Neurosci |year=2006 |volume=26 |pages=2894–2906 |doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4915-05.2006 |pmid=16540566}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neuron is excited by similarity to a static frame of the walker stimulus. For this experiment, 4,000 neurons were generated (8 walkers times 100 frames per cycle times 5 2D projections). A neuron's similarity to a frame of the stimulus is calculated as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;R_\psi(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \exp \left( - \frac{\left | (x_i(t), y_i(t)) - (\Chi_i, _\psi, \Rho_i, _\psi) \right \vert ^2}{2 \sdot \sigma} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(x_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; describe a stimulus point and &lt;math&gt;(c_i, r_i)&lt;/math&gt; describe the limb location at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; describes the preferred posture; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; describes a neuron's response to a stimulus of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; points; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; describes limb width.

''Response Simulation''

The neuron most closely resembling the posture of the walking stimulus changes over time. The neural activation pattern can be graphed in a 2D plot, called a posture-time plot. Along the x axis, templates are sorted chronologically according to a forward walking pattern. Time progresses along the y axis with the beginning corresponding to the origin. The perception of forward walking motion is represented as a line with a positive [[slope]] from the origin, while backward walking is conversely represented as a line with a negative slope.

====Motion Model====
''Motion Detection in Posture Space''

The posture-time plots used in this model follow the established space-time plots used for describing object motion.&lt;ref name=Adelson&amp;Bergen1985&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spatiotemporal energy models for the perception of motion |vauthors=Adelson EH, Bergen JR |journal=J Opt Soc Am |year=1985 |volume=2 |pages=284–299 |doi=10.1364/josaa.2.000284 |pmid=3973762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space-time plots with time at the y axis and the spatial dimension at the x axis, define [[velocity]] of an object by the slope of the line. Information about an object's motion can be detected by spatio-temporal [[Filter (higher-order function)|filters]].&lt;ref name=Rechardt1957&gt;{{cite journal |title=Autokorrelations-Auswertung als Funktionsprinzip des Zentralnervensystems |author=Reichardt W |journal=Z Naturforsch |year=1957 |volume=12 |pages=448–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanSanten&amp;Sperling1984&gt;{{cite journal |title=Temporal covariance model of human motion perception |vauthors=van Santen JP, Sperling G |journal=J Opt Soc Am |year=1984 |volume=1 |pages=451–473 |doi=10.1364/josaa.1.000451}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this biological motion model, motion is detected similarly but replaces the spatial dimension for posture space along the x axis, and body motion is detected by using posturo-temporal filters rather than spatio-temporal filters.

Neural responses are first normalized as described by &lt;ref name=Simoncelli&amp;Heeger1998&gt;{{cite journal |title=A model of neuronal responses in visual area MT |vauthors=Simoncelli EP, Heeger DJ |journal=Vision Res |year=1998 |volume=38 |pages=743–761 |doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\nu_\psi(t) = \frac{R_\psi(t) - \bar{R}}{\bar{R}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_y(t)&lt;/math&gt; describes the neural response; &lt;math&gt;_\psi&lt;/math&gt; describes the preferred posture at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; describes the mean neural response over all neurons over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;n_y(t)&lt;/math&gt; describes the normalized response. The filters are defined for forward and backward walking (&lt;math&gt;g^f, g^b&lt;/math&gt; respectively). The response of the posturo-temporal filter is described

::&lt;math&gt;r_\psi(\tau) = \sum_{t=0ms}^\tau \sum_{p=1}^{100} g_{\tau, \psi} (t, p) \sdot \nu_\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the response of the filter at time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; describes the posture dimension. The response of the filter is normalized by

::&lt;math&gt;N_\psi(\tau) = \max \left [ \left ( \frac{r_\psi(\tau)}{\sum_t \sum_p g_{\tau, \psi} (t, p)^2} \right ), 0 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; describes the response of the neuron selecting body motion. Finally, body motion is calculated by

::&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\psi(\tau) = N_\psi^F(\tau)^2 - N_\psi^B(\tau)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; describes body motion energy.

===Critical Features for the Recognition of Biological Motion (Casille and Giese, 2005)===

====Statistical Analysis and Psychophysical Experiments====
The following model suggests that biological motion recognition could be accomplished through the extraction of a single critical feature: dominant local [[Optical flow|optic flow]] motion. These following assumptions were brought about from results of both statistical analysis and [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] experiments.&lt;ref name=Casile2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Critical features for the recognition of biological motion|authors=Casile, &amp; Giese |journal=Journal of Vision |year=2005 |volume=5 |pages=348–360 |doi=10.1167/5.4.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, [[Principal component analysis]] was done on full body [[2d computer graphics|2d]] walkers and point light walkers. The analysis found that dominant local optic flow features are very similar in both full body 2d stimuli and point light walkers (Figure 1).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt; Since subjects can recognize biological motion upon viewing a point light walker, then the similarities between these two stimuli may highlight critical features needed for biological motion recognition.

Through psychophysical experiments, it was found that [[Human subject research|subjects]] could recognize biological motion using a CFS [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] which  contained opponent motion in the horizontal direction but randomly moving dots in the horizontal direction (Figure 2).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt; Because of the movement of the dots, this stimulus could not be fit to a human [[skeleton]] model suggesting that biological motion recognition may not heavily rely on form as a critical feature. Also, the psychophysical experiments showed that subjects similarly recognize biological motion for both the CFS stimulus and SPS, a stimulus in which dots of the point light walker were reassigned to different positions within the human body shape for every nth frame thereby highlights the importance of form vs the motion (Fig.1.).&lt;ref name=Beintema2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion without local image motion|authors=Beintema, &amp; Lappe |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2002 |volume=99|issue =8|pages=5661–5663 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082483699|pmc=122827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the following psychophysical experiments show that motion is a critical feature that could be used to recognize biological motion.

The following statistical analysis and psychophysical experiments highlight the importance of dominant local motion patterns in biological motion recognition.Furthermore, due to the ability of subjects to recognize biological motion given the CFS stimulus, it is postulated that [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] opponent motion and coarse positional information is important for recognition of biological motion.

====Model====
The following model contains detectors modeled from existing neurons that extracts motion features with increasing complexity. (Figure 4).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt;

''Detectors of Local Motion''

These detectors detect different motion directions and are modeled from neurons in monkey V1/2 and area [[Middle temporal gyrus|MT]]&lt;ref name=Snowden1994&gt;{{cite journal |title=Motion processing in the primate cerebral cortex|author=Snowden, R.J. |journal=Visual detection of motion |year=1994 |pages=51–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The output of the local motion detectors are the following:
::&lt;math&gt;G_p(x) = H(v(x),v_1,v_2) \cdot  b(\theta,\theta_p) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the position with preferred direction &lt;math&gt;\theta_p,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;  is the velocity, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the direction, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the rectangular speed tuning function such that

::&lt;math&gt;H(v,v_1,v_2) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; v_1 &lt; v &lt; v_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; H(v,v_1,v_2) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The direction-tuning of motion energy detectors are given by

::&lt;math&gt; b(\theta,\theta_p)=\left\{ \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) \left [\ 1 + cos(\theta,\theta_p)\right]\ \right\}^q &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that determines width of direction tuning function. (q=2 for simulation).

''Neural detectors for opponent motion selection''

The following neural detectors are used to detect horizontal and vertical opponent motion due by pooling together the output of previous local motion energy detectors into two adjacent subfields. Local motion detectors that have the same direction preference are combined into the same subfield. These detectors were modeled after neurons sensitive to opponent motion such as the ones in [[Middle temporal gyrus|MT]] and [[Superior temporal sulcus|medial superior temporal (MST)]].&lt;ref name=Born2000&gt;{{cite journal |title=Center-surround interactions in the middle temporal visual area of the owl monkey|author=Born, R.T. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |year=2000 |volume = 84|pages=2658–2669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka1989&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analysis of motion in the visual field by direction, expansion/contraction, and rotation cells clustered in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area of the macaque monkey|author1=Tanaka, K.  |author2=Saito, H  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |year=2000 |volume = 62| issue = 3| pages=535–552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, KO/V3B has been associated with processing edges, moving objects, and opponent motion. Patients with damage to dorsal pathway areas but an intact KO/V3B, as seen in patient AF can still perceive biological motion.&lt;ref name=Vaina1990&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intact "biological motion" and "structure from motion" perception in a patient with impaired motion mechanisms: A case study |authors=Vaina, L. M., Lemay, M., Bienfang, D., Choi, A. &amp; Nakayama, K. |journal=Visual Neuroscience |year=1990 |volume = 5| pages=353–369 |doi=10.1017/s0952523800000444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output for these detectors are the following:

::&lt;math&gt;o_l(x)=\sqrt{max(g_p(x_i))max(g_r(x_j))}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the position the output is centered at, direction preferences &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; signify spatial positions of two subfields.

The final output of opponent motion detector is given as

::&lt;math&gt;o_l(x)=max(o_l(x_k))&lt;/math&gt;

where output is the pooled responses of detectors of type &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x_k &lt;/math&gt; different spatial positions.

''Detectors of optic flow patterns''

Each detector looks at one frame of a training stimulus and compute an instantaneous optic flow field for that particular frame. These detectors model neurons in [[Superior temporal sulcus]]&lt;ref name=Grossman2000&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain areas involved in perception of biological motion|authors=Grossman, E. Donnelly, M. Price, R., Pickens, D. Morgan, V., Neighbor, G. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |year=2000 |volume = 12|issue = 5| pages=711–720 |doi=10.1162/089892900562417 |pmid=11054914|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fusiform face area]]&lt;ref name=Grossman2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain areas active during visual perception of biological motion|author1=Grossman, E.  |author2=Blake, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Neuron |year=2002 |volume = 35|pages=1167–1175 |doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00897-8 |pmid=12354405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The input of these detectors is arranged from vector u and are comprised from the previous opponent motion detectors’ responses. The output is the following:

::&lt;math&gt;G(u) = e^{(u-u_0)^T C(u-u_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is the center of the [[radial basis function]] for each neuron and &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix which contains elements that have been set during training and correspond to vector u. These elements equal zero if the variance over training doesn't exceed a certain threshold. Otherwise, these elements equal the inverse of variance.

Since recognition of biological motion is dependent on the sequence of activity, the following model is sequence selective. The activity of the optic flow pattern neuron is modeled by the following equation of

::&lt;math&gt;\tau H_k^l(t) = -H_k^l(t) + \sum_m w(k-m)f(H_k^l(t)+G_k^l(t))&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a specific frame in the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-th training sequence, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time constant.&lt;math&gt;f(H)&lt;/math&gt; a threshold function, &lt;math&gt;w(m)&lt;/math&gt; is an asymmetric interaction kernel, and &lt;math&gt;G_k^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the previous section.

''Detectors of complete biological motion patterns''
The following detectors sum the output of the optic flow pattern detectors in order to selectively activate for whole movement patterns (e.g. walking right vs. walking left). These detectors model similar neurons that optic flow pattern detectors model:

[[Superior temporal sulcus]]&lt;ref name="Grossman2000"/&gt; and [[Fusiform face area]]&lt;ref name="Grossman2002"/&gt;

The input of these detectors are the activity of the optic flow motion detectors, &lt;math&gt;H_l^l(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The output of these detectors are the following:

::&lt;math&gt;\tau_s P^l (t) = -P^l(t) + \sum_k H_l^l(t)&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;P^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the activity of the complete biological motion pattern detector in response to pattern type &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; (e.g. walking to the left), &lt;math&gt; \tau_s &lt;/math&gt; equals the time constant (used 150 ms in simulation), and &lt;math&gt;H_k^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; equals the activity of optic flow pattern detector at kth frame in sequence l.

====Testing the model====

Using correct determination of walking direction of both the CFS and SPS stimulus, the model was able to replicate similar results as the psychophysical experiments. (could determine walking direction of CFS and SPS stimuli and increasing correct with increasing number of dots). It is postulated that recognition of biological motion is made possible by the opponent horizontal motion information that is present in both the CFS and SPS stimuli.

'''Zhuyin Fuhao''' ({{zh|t=注音符號|p=zhùyīn fúhào}}), '''Zhuyin''' ({{zh|t=注音}}), '''Bopomofo''' (ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) or '''Mandarin Phonetic Symbols''' is the major [[Transliteration of Chinese|Chinese transliteration]] system for [[Taiwanese Mandarin]]. It is also used to transcribe other [[varieties of Chinese]], particularly other varieties of [[Standard Chinese]] and related [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin dialects]], as well as [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].

Zhuyin Fuhao and Zhuyin are traditional terms, whereas Bopomofo is the colloquial term, also used by the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] and [[Unicode]]. Consisting of 37 characters and four [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marks, it transcribes all possible sounds in Mandarin. Zhuyin was introduced in China by the [[Beiyang government|Republican Government]] in the 1910s and used alongside the [[Wade-Giles]] system, which used a modified [[Latin alphabet]]. The Wade system was replaced by [[Hanyu Pinyin]] in 1958 by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=2008-02-11 |title = Pinyin celebrates 50th birthday |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/news/242463.htm |accessdate = 2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1982.&lt;ref name="ISO1982"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 – Documentation – Romanization of Chinese |accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Taiwan adopted Hanyu Pinyin as its official [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] system in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shih Hsiu-Chuan |work=Taipei Times |page=2 |date=18 Sep 2008 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bopomofo is still an official transliteration system there and remains widely used as an educational tool and for [[Chinese input methods for computers|electronic input methods]].

==Name==
The informal name "Bopomofo" is derived from the first four syllables in the conventional ordering of available syllables in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The four Bopomofo characters ({{lang|zh|ㄅㄆㄇㄈ}}) that correspond to these syllables are usually placed first in a list of these characters. The same sequence is sometimes used by other speakers of Chinese to refer to other phonetic systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The original formal name of the system was ''Guóyīn Zìmǔ'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|國音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|国音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Phonetic Alphabet of the [[Standard Mandarin|National Language]]") and ''Zhùyīn Zìmǔ'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|註音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Phonetic Alphabet" or "Annotated Phonetic Letters").&lt;ref name=GIO/&gt; It was later renamed ''Zhùyīn Fúhào'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音符號}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音符号}}}}), meaning "phonetic symbols".

In official documents, Zhuyin is occasionally called "Mandarin Phonetic Symbols I" ({{nobreak|{{lang|zh|國語注音符號第一式}}}}), abbreviated as "MPS I" {{nobreak|({{lang|zh|注音一式}}).}}

In English translations, the system is often also called either ''Chu-yin'' or ''the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols''.&lt;ref name=GIO&gt;{{cite web|first=Government Information Office |last=The Republic of China government |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02PeopleandLanguage.htm |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2006: The People &amp; Languages |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509032222/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02PeopleandLanguage.htm |archivedate=2007-05-09 |df= }} &amp;#124;Also available at&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=headlines&gt;{{cite web |author=Taiwan Headlines |publisher=Government Information Office, Taiwan(ROC) |url=http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=85286&amp;ctNode=10 |title=Taiwan Headlines: Society News: New Taiwanese dictionary unveiled}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[romanization of Chinese|romanized]] phonetic system was released in 1984 as [[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]] (MPS II).

== History ==
{{main article|Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation#Phonetic symbols}}

The [[Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation]], led by [[Wu Zhihui]] from 1912 to 1913, created a system called ''Zhuyin Zimu'',&lt;ref name=GIO /&gt; which was based on [[Zhang Binglin]]'s shorthand. A draft was released on July 11, 1913, by the Republic of China National Ministry of Education, but it was not officially proclaimed until November 23, 1928.&lt;ref name=GIO /&gt; It was later renamed first ''Guoyin Zimu'' and then, in April 1930, ''Zhuyin Fuhao''. The last renaming addressed fears that the alphabetic system might independently replace [[Chinese character]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]]. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''. Honolulu, HI, USA: University of Hawaii Press, 1984. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use in Taiwan ==
[[File:Left arrow direction sign using bopomofo in Taipei Municipal Dunhua Elementary School 20160804.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Direction sign for children in Taipei including bopomofo]]
Zhuyin remains the predominant phonetic system in teaching reading and writing in [[elementary school]] in Taiwan. It is also one of the most popular ways to enter Chinese characters into computers and [[smartphone]]s and to look up characters in a dictionary.

In elementary school, particularly in the lower years, Chinese characters in textbooks are often annotated with Zhuyin as [[ruby character]]s as an aid to learning. Additionally, one children's newspaper in Taiwan, the ''[[Mandarin Daily News]]'', annotates all articles with Zhuyin ruby characters.

In teaching Mandarin, Taiwan institutions and some overseas communities use Zhuyin as a learning tool.

==Etymology==
[[File:Bopomofo.gif|right|thumb|200px|Table showing Zhuyin in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]]]
[[File:Bopomofo in Regular, Handwritten Regular &amp; Cursive formats.jpg|thumb|Bopomofo in Regular, Handwritten Regular &amp; Cursive formats]]
The Zhuyin characters were created by [[Zhang Binglin]], and taken mainly from "[[Regular script|regularised]]" forms of ancient Chinese characters, the modern readings of which contain the sound that each letter represents. It is to be noted that the first consonants are articulated from the front of the mouth to the back, /b/, /p/, /m/, /f/, /d/, /t/, /n/, /l/ etc.

== Writing ==

===Stroke order===
Zhuyin is written in the same stroke order rule as Chinese characters. Note that ㄖ is written with three strokes, unlike the character from which it is derived (日, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: rì), which has four strokes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tonal marks ===

As shown in the following table, [[Mandarin phonology#Tones|tone]] marks for the second, third, and fourth tones are shared between bopomofo and [[Pinyin#Tones|pinyin]]. In bopomofo, the lack of a marker is used to indicate the first tone while a dot above indicates the fifth tone (also known as the neutral tone). In pinyin, a macron indicates the first tone and the lack of a marker indicates the fifth tone.

Unlike Hanyu Pinyin, Zhuyin aligns well with the hanzi characters in books whose texts are printed vertically, making Zhuyin better suited for annotating the pronunciation of vertically oriented Chinese text.

Zhuyin, when used in conjunction with Chinese characters, are typically placed to the right of the Chinese character vertically or to the top of the Chinese character in a horizontal print (see [[Ruby character]]).

Below is an example for the word "bottle" ({{zh|p=píngzi}}):

|}
|}

===Érhuà transcription===
[[Érhuà]]-ed words merge as a single syllable, which means {{lang|zh-Bopo|ㄦ}} is attached to the precedent syllable (like {{ruby-zh-b|歌兒|ㄍㄜㄦ}} gēr). In case the syllable uses other tones than 1st tone, the tone is attached to the penultimate syllable, but not to {{lang|zh-Bopo|ㄦ}} (e.g. {{ruby-zh-b|哪兒|ㄋㄚˇㄦ}} nǎr; {{ruby-zh-b|一|ㄧ}}{{ruby-zh-b|點兒|ㄉㄧㄢˇㄦ}} yīdiǎnr; {{ruby-zh-b|好|ㄏㄠˇ}}{{ruby-zh-b|玩兒|ㄨㄢˊㄦ}} hǎowánr). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Script/zhuyin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison ==

=== Pinyin ===
Zhuyin and [[pinyin]] are based on the same Mandarin pronunciations, hence there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two systems:

==Non-Standard Mandarin dialects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Three letters formerly used in non-standard dialects of Mandarin are now also used to write other [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]]. Some Zhuyin fonts do not contain these letters; see [[#External links|External links]] for [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] pictures.

In Taiwan, Bopomofo is used to teach [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], and is also used to transcribe it phonetically in contexts such as on storefront signs, karaoke lyrics, and film subtitles.

==Computer uses==

===Input method===
[[File:bopomofo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|thumb|An example of a Zhuyin keypad for Taiwan]]
Zhuyin can be used as an [[Chinese input methods for computers|input method for Chinese characters]]. It is one of the few input methods that can be found on most modern personal computers without the user having to download or install any additional software. It is also one of the few input methods that can be used for inputting Chinese characters on certain [[cell phone]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
[[File:Keyboard layout Zhuyin.svg|thumb|300px|none|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for Zhuyin on computers]]

===Unicode===
{{Main article|Bopomofo (Unicode block)|Bopomofo Extended|l2=Bopomofo Extended (Unicode block)}}
Zhuyin was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Zhuyin, called Bopomofo, is U+3100&amp;ndash;U+312F:
{{Unicode chart Bopomofo}}

Additional characters were added in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The Unicode block for these additional characters, called Bopomofo Extended, is U+31A0&amp;ndash;U+31BF:

{{Unicode chart Bopomofo Extended}}

Unicode 3.0 also added the characters U+02EA and U+02EB, in the [[Spacing Modifier Letters]] block. These two characters are now (since Unicode 6.0) classified as Bopomofo characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scripts-6.0.0.txt|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/6.0.0/ucd/Scripts.txt|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddha-nature''' or '''Buddha Principle''' refers to several related terms,{{refn|group=note|Buddha-dhatu, mind, tathagatagarbha, Dharma-dhatu, suchness (tathata).{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}} most notably ''tathāgatagarbha'' and ''buddhadhātu''.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit; Jp. ''Busshō'', "Buddha-nature".}} ''Tathāgatagarbha'' means "the womb" or "embryo" (''garbha'') of the "thus-gone" (''tathagata''),{{refn|group=note|Enlightened one, a/the Buddha}} or "containing a tathagata", while ''buddhadhātu'' literally means "Buddha-realm" or "Buddha-substrate".{{refn|group=note|Kevin Trainor: "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}}}

''Tathāgatagarbha'' has a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) meanings in Indian and later East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist literature. Debates on what the term means continues to be a major part of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] scholastics.

For example, the Tibetan scholar [[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] outlined four meanings of the term ''Tathāgatagarbha'' as used by Indian Buddhist scholars generally: (1) As an [[Rangtong-Shentong#Rangtong|emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation]], (2) the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]], (3) [[Alaya-vijnana|alaya-vijñana]] (store-consciousness), (4) all [[bodhisattva]]s and sentient beings.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

===Tathāgatagarbha===
The term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may mean "embryonic tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} "womb of the tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "containing a tathagata".{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}} Various meanings may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

====Compound====
The Sanskrit term ''tathāgatagarbha'' is a compound of two terms, ''[[tathāgata]]'' and ''garbha'':{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
* ''tathāgata'' means "the one thus gone", referring to the Buddha. It is composed of "''tathā''" and "''āgata", "thus come"'',{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or ''"tathā"'' and ''"gata"'', ''"thus gone"''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, G. S. F., ed. (1972). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. (NB: with an "Introduction" by T. O. Ling.) New York, NY, USA: Charles Scribner's Sons. [I]SBN 684-12763-6 (trade cloth) p.240&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to a Buddha, who has "thus gone" from samsara into nirvana, and "thus come" from nirvana into samsara to work for the salvation of all sentient beings.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
* ''garbha'', "womb",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "embryo",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "center",{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "essence".{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=263}}{{refn|group=note|According to Wayman &amp; Wayman, the term ''garbha'' takes on various meanings, depending on its context. They transalte a passage from the ''Sri-mala-sutra'' as follows: "Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the Illustrious Dharmadhatu-womb, neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Is the dharmakaya-embryo, not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality. Is the supramundane ''dharma''-center, not the domain of beings who adhere to wayward views. Is the intrinsically pure ''dharma''-center, not the domain of beings who deviate from voidness".{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=ix}}}}

====Asian translations====
The Chinese translated the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' as ({{CJKV|t=如来藏|p=rúláizàng}},{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "Tathāgata's (''rúlái'') storehouse" (''zàng'').{{sfn|King|1991|p=48}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} According to Brown, "storehouse" may indicate both "that which enfolds or contains something",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} or "that which is itself enfolded, hidden or contained by another."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The Tibetan translation is ''de bzhin gsegs pa'i snyin po'', which cannot be translated as "womb" (''mngal'' or ''lhums''), but as "embryonic essence", "kernel" or "heart".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The term "heart" was also used by Mongolian translators.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}}

====Western translations====
The term ''tathagatagarbha'' is translated and interpreted in various ways by western translators and scholars:
* According to Sally King, the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may be understood in two ways:{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
# "embryonic tathāgata", the incipient Buddha, the ''cause'' of the Tathāgata,
# "womb of the tathāgata", the ''fruit'' of Tathāgata. 
:According to King, the Chinese ''rúláizàng'' was taken in its meaning as "womb" or "fruit".{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} 
* Wayman &amp; Wayman also point out that the Chinese regularly takes ''garbha'' as "womb",{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=ix}} but prefer to use the term "embryo".
* According to Brown, following Wayman &amp; Wayman, "embryo" is the best fitting translation, since it preserves "the dynamic, self-transformative nature of the ''tathagatagarbha''."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
* According to Zimmerman, ''garbha'' may also mean the interior or center of something,{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=40}} and its essence or central part.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=41}} As a ''[[tatpurusa]]''{{refn|group=note|In [[Sanskrit grammar]] a '''{{IAST|tatpuruṣa}}''' (तत्पुरुष) compound is a dependent determinative [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]], i.e. a compound XY meaning a type of Y which is related to X in a way corresponding to one of the grammatical cases of X.}} it may refer to a person ''being'' a "womb" for or "container" of the tathagata.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} As a ''[[bahuvrihi]]''{{refn|group=note|A '''bahuvrihi compound''' (from Sanskrit बहुव्रीहि, ''bahuvrīhi'', literally meaning "much rice" but denoting a rich man) is a type of compound that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses.}} it may refer to a person as ''having'' an embryonic tathagata inside.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} In both cases, this embryonic tathagata still has to be developed.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} Zimmerman concludes that ''tathagatagarbha'' is a ''bahuvrihi'', meaning "containing a tathagata",{{refn|group=note|In the ''Maraparinirvana Sutra'' the term ''tathagatagarbha'' replaces the term ''buddhadhatu'', which originally referred to relics. Worship of the physical relics of the Buddha was reshaped into worship of the inner Buddha.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}}}} but notes the variety of meanings of ''garbha'', such as "containing", "born from", "embryo", "(embracing/concealing) womb", "calyx", "child", "member of a clan", "core", which may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

===Buddha-nature===
The term "Buddha-nature" ({{CJKV|t=佛性|p=fóxìng}}, {{CJKV|j=busshō}}{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}) is closely related in meaning to the term ''tathāgatagarbha'', but is not a translation of this term.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{refn|group=note|For the various equivalents of the Sanskrit term "''tathāgatagarbha''" in other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), see [[Glossary of Buddhism]], "tathagatagarbha"}} It refers to what is essential in the human being.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

The corresponding Sanskrit term is ''buddhadhātu''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} It has two meanings, namely the nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term [[dharmakāya]], and the cause of the Buddha.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} The link between the cause and the result is the nature (''dhātu'') which is common to both, namely the dharmadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

Matsumoto Shirō also points out that "Buddha-nature" translates the Sanskrit-term buddhadhātu, a "place to put something," a "foundation," a "locus."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}} According to Shirō, it does not mean "original nature" or "essence," nor does it mean the "possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood," "the original nature of the Buddha," or "the essence of the Buddha."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}}

In the [[Vajrayana]], the term for Buddha-nature is ''sugatagarbha''.

==Indian Sutra sources==
===Earliest sources===
According to Wayman, the idea of the tathagatagarbha is grounded on sayings by the Buddha that there is something called the [[luminous mind]]{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}} (''prabhasvara citta''{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}), "which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|agantukaklesa]])"{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}} The luminous mind is mentioned in a passage from the [[Anguttara Nikaya]]:{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=56}} "Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (1995). [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous], (Anguttara Nikaya 1.49-52)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Harvey mentions AN 1.10: "Monks, this mind (''[[citta]]'') is brightly shining (''pabhassara''), but it is defiled by defilements which arrive". AN 1.49-52 gives a similar statement}} The [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school coupled this idea of the luminous mind with the idea of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mulavijnana]], the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}

From the idea of the luminous mind emerged the idea that the awakened mind is the pure (''visuddhi''), undefiled mind. In the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathagatagarbha-sutras]] it is this pure consciousness that is regarded to be the seed from which Buddhahood grows:
{{quote|When this intrinsically pure consciousness came to be regarded as an element capable of growing into [[Buddhahood]], there was the "embryo (''garbha'') of the Tathagata (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;Buddha)" doctrine, whether or not this term is employed.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}Karl Brunnholzl writes that the first probable mention of the term is in the ''Ekottarika [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agama]]'' (though here it is used in a different way then in later texts). The passage states:&lt;blockquote&gt;If someone devotes himself to the Ekottarikagama, Then he has the ''tathagatagarbha''. Even if his body cannot exhaust defilements in this life, In his next life he will attain supreme wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This tathāgatagarbha idea was the result of an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of human consciousness and the means of awakening.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}}{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai}} Gregory comments on this origin of the Tathagatagarba-doctrine: "The implication of this doctrine [...] is that enlightenment is the natural and true state of the mind."{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

===''Avatamsaka Sutra''===
According to Wayman, the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' (1st-3rd century CE) was the next step in the development of the Buddha-nature thought after the concept of the luminous mind:

{{quote|[W]here it is taught that the Buddha's divine knowledge pervades sentient beings, and that its representation in an individual being is the substratum consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}
The ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' does not contain a "singular discussion of the concept",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} but the idea of "a universal penetration of sentient beings by the wisdom of the Buddha (''buddhajñāna'')" was complementary to the concept of the Buddha-womb.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
The basic idea of the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra '' is the unity of the absolute and the relative:

{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The universal Buddhahood of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=46-47}}{{refn|group=note|Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:&lt;br&gt;
quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}}}}}

All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}

===''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'' ===
The ''[[Lotus Sutra]] (''Skt'': Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra)'', written between 100 BCE and 200 CE, does not mention Buddha-nature, but shares other themes and ideas with the later [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]] like the ''tathāgatagarbha sūtra'' and some scholars theorize that it was an influence on these texts.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth chapter emphasizes, in accordance with the Bodhisattva-ideal of the Mahayana teachings, that everyone can be liberated. All living beings can become a buddha, not only  monks and nuns, but also laypeople, [[śrāvaka]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and non-human creatures.&lt;ref name="Reeves" /&gt; It also details that all living beings can be a 'teacher of the Dharma'.

The twelfth chapter of the ''Lotus Sutra'' details that the potential to become enlightened is universal among all people, even the historical [[Devadatta]] has the potential to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Devadatta is followed by another story about a [[Longnü|dragon princess]] who is both a [[nāga]] and a female, whom the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] proclaims will reach enlightenment immediately, in her present form.

===''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras''===
{{Main|Tathāgatagarbha sūtras}}
There are several major Indian texts which discuss the idea of Buddha-nature and they are often termed the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]. According to Brunnholzl "the earliest [[mahayana sutras]] that are based on and discuss the notion of tathagatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their ideas became very influential in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mahayana sutras which mention this doctrine include the [[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra|''Tathāgatagarbha sūtra'']], ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]],'' ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]],'' ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]], [[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The ''[[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]'' (200-250 CE) is considered (...) "the earliest expression of this (the tathāgatagarbha doctrine) and the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' itself seems to have been coined in this very sutra."{{sfn|Zimmermann|1999|p=143–168}} It states that one is already or primordially awakened and that all beings already have perfect [[buddhahood]] within themselves but do not recognize it because it is covered over by afflictions.&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=47-48}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|2002|p=39 ff. and 50 ff.}}&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of these texts, the ''Ghanavyuha Sutra'' (as quoted by [[Longchenpa]]) states that the tathāgatagarbha is the ground of all things:

{{quote|... the ultimate universal ground also has always been with the Buddha-Essence (Tathagatagarbha), and this essence in terms of the universal ground has been taught by the Tathagata. The fools who do not know it, because of their habits, see even the universal ground as (having) various happiness and suffering and actions and emotional defilements. Its nature is pure and immaculate, its qualities are as wishing-jewels; there are neither changes nor cessations. Whoever realizes it attains Liberation&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''Buddha Mind''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion: p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra''===
The ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}}), also named ''The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala'', centers on the teaching of the tathagatagarbha as "ultimate soteriological principle".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=10}} Regarding the tathāgatagarbha, it states:

{{quote|Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. The Tathagatagarbha is not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality, who adhere to wayward views, whose thoughts are distracted by voidness. Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the Illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the Dharmakaya, the embryo of the supramundane ''dharma'', the embryo of the intrinsically pure ''dharma''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}}}

In the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' there are two possible states for the tathāgatagarbha:

{{quote|[E]ither covered by defilements, when it is called only "embryo of the Tathagata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathagata" is no more the "embryo" (potentiality) but the Tathagata (actuality).{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

The sutra itself states it this way:

{{quote|This Dharmakaya of the Tathagata when not free from the store of defilement is referred to as the Tathagatagarbha.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=98}}}}

===''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra''===
[[File:Sui Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra.JPG|thumb|A [[Sui dynasty]] manuscript of the ''Nirvāṇa Sūtra'']]
The early Buddha-nature concept as expressed in the seminal 'tathagatagarbha sutra' named the ''Nirvana Sutra'' is, according to Kevin Trainor, as follows: "Sentient beings are said to possess a sacred nature that is the basis for them becoming buddhas [...] this buddha-nature is in fact our true nature [...] universal and completely unsullied by whatever psychological and karmic state an individual may be in."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}

The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' (written 2nd century CE) was very influential in the Chinese reception of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Lai}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' linked the concept of tathāgatagarbha with the buddhadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Kosho Yamamoto points out that the ''Nirvana Sutra'' contains a series of equations: "Thus, there comes about the equation of: Buddha Body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Dharmakaya &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal Buddha &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Eternity."{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975}} According to Shimoda Masahiro, the authors of the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' were  leaders and advocates of stupa worship. The term ''buddhadhātu'' originally referred to relics. In the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', it came to be used in place of the concept of ''tathāgatagārbha''. The authors used the teachings of the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' to reshape the worship of the physical relics of the Buddha into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}} Sasaki, in a review of Shimoda, conveys a key premise of Shimoda's work, namely, that the origins of Mahayana Buddhism and the ''Nirvana Sutra'' are entwined.{{sfn|Sasaki|1999}}

The Buddha-nature is always present, in all times and in all beings. This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of tenacious negative mental afflictions within each being.{{refn|group=note|The most notable of which are greed 貪, hatred 嗔, delusion 癡, and pride 慢}} Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the Buddha-dhatu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the Buddha-sphere (Buddha-dhatu/ visaya) can then be consciously "entered into", and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=94–96}}

{{quote|[T]he tathagatagarbha is none but Thusness or the Buddha Nature, and is the originally untainted pure mind which lies overspread by, and exists in, the mind of greed and anger of all beings. This bespeaks a Buddha Body that exists in a state of bondage.{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=87}}}}

According to Sallie B. King, it does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhatu'' with ''tathagatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The sutra presents the Buddha-nature or tathagatagarbha as a "Self". The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' refers to a true self.  "The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṅa Sūtra'', especially influential in East Asian Buddhist thought, goes so far as to speak of it as our true self (ātman). Its precise metaphysical and ontological status is, however, open to interpretation in the terms of different Mahāyāna philosophical schools; for the Madhyamikas it must be empty of its own existence like everything else; for the Yogacarins, following the Laṅkāvatāra, it can be identified with store consciousness, as the receptacle of the seeds of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=52}}  Paul Williams states: "[...] it is obvious that the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' does not consider it impossible for a Buddhist to affirm an atman provided it is clear what the correct understanding of this concept is, and indeed the sutra clearly sees certain advantages in doing so."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}} but it speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Paul Williams also notes:

{{quote|Nevertheless the sutra as it stands is quite clear that while [...] we can speak of [the tathagatagharba] as Self, actually it is not at all a Self, and those who have such Self-notions cannot perceive the tathagatagarbha and thus become enlightened (see Ruegg 1989a: 21-6).{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}}}}

===''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''===
The ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' (compiled 350-400 CE&lt;ref name="KaluPhy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;ots=ISCxmxGp_c&amp;dq=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;f=false|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824814021|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) synthesized the tathagatagarba-doctrine and the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālāya-vijñāna]] doctrine. The Lankavatara Sutra "assimilates Tathagata-garbha thought to the Yogacara-viewpoint, and this assimilation is further developed in [...] The Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=114}} According to the Lankavatara Sutra ''tathāgatagarbha'' is identical to the ''ālaya-vijñāna'', known prior to awakening as the storehouse-consciousness or 8th consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: Section LXXXII, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The ālāya-vijñāna is supposed to contain the pure seed, or tathagatagarbha, from which awakening arises.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

The Lankavatara-sutra contains tathagata-garba thought, but also warns against reification of the idea of Buddha-nature, and presents it as an aid to attaining awakening:

{{quote|Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers? The ego as taught by the philosophers is an eternal creator, unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable.&lt;br&gt;
The Blessed One replied: [...] it is emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvana, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid of will-effort; the reason why the Tathagatas [...] teach the doctrine pointing to the Tathagata-garba is to make the ignorant cast aside their fear when they listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the state of non-discrimination and imagelessness&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T.

According to Alex and Hideko Wayman, the equation of tathagatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna in the Lankavatara fails:

{{quote|It is plain that when the ''Lankavatara-sutra'' identifies the two terms, this scripture necessarily diverges in the meaning of one or both of the terms from the usage of the term Tathagatagarbha in the earlier ''Sri-Mala'' or of the term ''ālāya-vijñāna '' in the subsequent Yogacara school.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series of [[Dzogchen]] a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q.

==In Indian commentaries==
The ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine was also widely discussed by Indian Mahayana scholars in treatises or commentaries, called [[shastra|śāstra]], the most influential of which was the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] (5th century CE).

===''Ratnagotravibhāga'' or ''Uttaratantraśāstra''===
The [[Ratnagotravibhāga]], also called ''Uttaratantraśāstra'' (5th century CE), is an Indian [[shastra|śāstra]] in which synthesised all the major elements and themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} It gives an overview of authoritative tathāgatagarbha sutras, mentioning the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'', the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'', ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]]'' and the ''Mahābherīharaka-sūtra''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=43}} It presents the tathāgatagarbha as "an ultimate, unconditional reality that is simultaneously the inherent, dynamic process towards its complete manifestation".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}} Mundane and enlightened reality are seen as complementary:

{{quote|Thusness [''tathata''] defiled is the Tathagatagarbha, and Thusness undefiled is Enlightenment.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

In the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', the tathāgatagarbha is seen as having three specific characteristics: (1) [[Dharmakāya|dharmakaya]], (2) [[suchness]], and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-[[Conceptual proliferation|conceptuality]].&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"/&gt;

According to the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', all sentient beings have "the embryo of the Tathagata" in three senses:{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=46}}

# the Tathāgata's dharmakāya permeates all sentient beings;
# the Tathāgata's ''[[tathatā]]'' is omnipresent (''avyatibheda'');
# the Tathāgata's species (''gotra'', a synonym for tathagatagarbha) occurs in them.

The Ratnagotravibhāga equates enlightenment with the nirvāṇa-realm and the dharmakāya.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}} It gives a variety of synonyms for ''garbha'', the most frequently used being ''gotra'' and ''dhatu''.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}}

This text also explains the tathāgatagarbha in terms of [[luminous mind]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Madhyamaka school ===
Indian [[Madhyamaka]] philosophers interpreted the theory as a description of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and as a non implicative negation. [[Bhāviveka|Bhaviveka]]'s ''Tarkajvala'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;[The expression] “possessing the tathagata heart” is [used] because emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and so on, exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings. However, it is not something like a permanent and all-pervasive person that is the inner agent. For we find [passages] such as “All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. What is emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness is the Tathagata.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;One should know that since [the alaya-consciousness] follows the nature of all entities, it is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term “alaya-consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] states that this statement is referencing the tathāgatagarbha doctrine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Candrakirti's ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' also argues, basing itself on the Lankavatara sutra, that "the statement of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Kamalaśīla|Kamalasila]]'s (c. 740-795) ''Madhyamakaloka'' associates tathāgatagarbha with [[Luminous mind|luminosity]] and luminosity with [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This statement “All sentient beings possess the tathāgata heart” teaches that all are suitable to attain the state of unsurpassable completely perfect awakening since it is held that the term tathāgata expresses that the dharmadhātu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Uniquely among [[Madhyamaka]] texts, some texts attributed to [[Nagarjuna]], mainly poetic works like the ''[[Dharmadhātustava|Dharmadhatustava]], Cittavajrastava'', and ''Bodhicittavivarana'' associate the term tathāgatagarbha with the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Yogacara scholars===
{{See also|Eight Consciousnesses#Transformations of consciousness|l1=Transformations of consciousness}}

According to Brunnholzl, "all early Indian Yogacara masters (such as [[Asanga]], [[Vasubandhu]], [[Sthiramati]], and Asvabhava), if they refer to the term tathāgatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but [[Tathātā|suchness]] in the sense of twofold identitylessness".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"/&gt;

Some later Yogacara scholars spoke of the tathāgatagarbha in more positive terms, such as Jñanasrimitra who in his ''Sakarasiddhi'' equates it with the appearances of lucidity (prakasarupa). Likewise, Brunnholzl notes that "[[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakarasanti]] generally describes the tathagata heart as being equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness, and the perfect nature (which he considers to be an implicative negation and not a nonimplicative negation)."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alaya-vijñana ===
The Yogacara concept of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|alaya-vijñana]] (store consciousness) also came to be associated by some scholars with the tathāgatagarbha. This can be seen in sutras like the Lankavatara, the Srimaladevi and in the translations of [[Paramartha]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ālaya-vijñāna originally meant defiled consciousness: defiled by the workings of [[Ayatana|the five senses and the mind]]. It was also seen as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or "stream of consciousness" from which awareness and perception spring.&lt;ref name="KaluPsy"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Principles%20of%20Buddhist%20Psychology_Kalupahana.pdf|title=The Principles of Buddhist Psychology|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780887064043|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To account for the notion of Buddha-nature in all beings, with the Yogacara belief in the [[Yogacara#Five Categories of Beings|Five Categories of Beings]], Yogacara scholars in China such as Tz'u-en (慈恩, 632-682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the Buddha-nature in practice (行佛性). The latter nature was determined by the innate [[Bīja|seeds]] in the alaya.&lt;ref name="groner"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Establishment of the Tendai School|last=Groner|first=Paul|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2000|isbn=0824823710|pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trikaya doctrine===
Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the [[Trikaya]] or ''three-body doctrine''. According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The Nirmana-kaya, or ''Transformation-body'', the earthly manifestation of the Buddha;
# The [[Sambhogakāya]], or ''Enjoyment-body'', a subtle body, by which the Buddha appears to bodhisattvas to teach them;
# The Dharmakāya, or ''Dharma-body'', the ultimate nature of the Buddha, and the ultimate nature of reality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

They may be described as follows:
{{quote|The first is the 'Knowledge-body' (''Jnana-kaya''), the inner nature shared by all Buddhas, their Buddha-ness (''buddhata'')&lt;br&gt;[...] The second aspect of the ''Dharma-body'' is the 'Self-existent-body' (''Svabhavika-kaya''). This is the ultimate nature of reality, thusness, emptiness: the non-nature which is the very nature of ''dharmas'', their ''dharma''-ness (''dharmata''). It is the ''Tathagata-garbha'' and ''[[bodhicitta]]'' hidden within beings, and the transformed 'storehouse-consciousness'.}}

==In Chinese Buddhism==
The [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathāgatagarbha]] idea was extremely influential in the development of [[East Asian Buddhism]].{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}} When Buddhism was introduced to China, in the 1st century CE, Buddhism was understood through comparisons of its teachings to Chinese terms and ways of thinking. Chinese Buddhist thinkers like Zhi Mindu, Zhidun, and Huiyuan (d. 433) interpreted Buddhist concepts in terms of the Chinese [[Xuanxue|neo-daoist]] philosophy called ‘dark learning’ (''xuanxue'').&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hurley, Scott, The doctrinal transformation of twentieth-century Chinese Buddhism: Master Yinshun’s interpretation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was only later countered by the work of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar-translators like [[Kumārajīva|Kumarajiva]].

The buddha nature idea was introduced into China with the translation of the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahaparanirvana sutra]] in the early fifth century and this text became the central source of buddha nature doctrine in Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Liu , Ming-Wood. The Yogaacaaraa and Maadhyamika Interpretation of the Buddha-nature Concept in Chinese Buddhism, Philosophy East and West, Volume 35, no. 2, April 1985 P.171-192 © by University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra some Chinese Buddhists supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|p=11}} This idea was interpreted as being similar to the ideas of [[Tao|Dao]] and [[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Principle (Li)]] in Chinese philosophy.

===The Awakening of Faith===
[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|The Awakening of Faith]] was very influential in the development of Chinese Buddhism {{sfn|Lai}} said to have been translated by [[Paramartha]] (499-569). While the text is traditionally attributed to [[{{IAST|Aśvaghoṣa}}]], no Sanskrit version of the text is extant. The earliest known versions are written in Chinese, and contemporary scholars believe that the text is a Chinese composition.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. The Heart Sūtra: A Chinese Apocryphal Text? ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Vol. 15 (2), 180-81, 1992. [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8800/2707 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese Buddhist Apocrypha'' by Robert E. Buswell. University of Hawaii Press: 1990. {{ISBN|0-8248-1253-0}}. pgs 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana'' offers a synthesis of Chinese buddhist thinking.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} It sees the Buddha-nature doctrine as a cosmological theory, in contrast to the Indo-Tibetan tradition, where the soteriological aspect is emphasized.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It described the "One Mind" which "includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal and transcendental world".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It tried to harmonize the ideas of the tathāgatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna:
{{quote|In the words of the Awakening of Faith — which summarizes the essentials of Mahayana — self and world, mind and suchness, are integrally one. Everything is a carrier of that a priori enlightenment; all incipient enlightenment is predicated on it. The mystery of existence is, then, not, "How may we overcome alienation?" The challenge is, rather, "Why do we think we are lost in the first place?"{{sfn|Lai}}}}

In the Awakening of Faith the 'one mind' has two aspects, namely tathata, suchness, the things as they are, and samsara, the cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} This text was in line with an essay by [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] (reign 502-549 CE), in which he postulated a pure essence, the enlightened mind, trapped in darkness, which is ignorance. By this ignorance the pure mind is trapped in samsara. This resembles the tathāgatagarba and the idea of the defilement of the luminous mind.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} In a commentary on this essay [[Shen Yue]] stated that insight into this true essence is awakened by stopping the thoughts - a point of view which is also being found in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}}

The joining together of these different ideas supported the notion of the [[ekayāna]], the one vehicle: absolute oneness, all-pervading Buddha-wisdom and [[hongaku|original enlightenment]] as a holistic whole. This synthesis was a reflection of the unity which was attained in China with the united [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Lai|p=12-13}}

=== In Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka ===
By the 6th century CE buddha nature had been well established in Chinese Buddhism and a wide variety of theories developed to explain it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One influential figure who wrote about buddha nature was Ching-ying Hui-yuan (523-592 CE), a [[East Asian Yogācāra|Chinese Yogacarin]] who argued for a kind of idealism which held that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"All dharmas without exception originate and are formed from the true[-mind], and other than the true[-mind], there exists absolutely nothing which can give rise to false thoughts."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Ching-ying Hui-yuan equated this 'true mind' with the alaya-vijñana, the tathāgatagarbha and "Buddha-nature" (''fóxìng'') and held that it was an essence, a true consciousness and a metaphysical principle that ensured that all sentient beings will reach enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Ming-Wood Liu "Hui-yuan's interpretation of the Buddha-nature doctrine represents the culmination of a long process of transformation of the "Buddha-nature" from a basically practical to an ontological concept."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Chinese Yogacara school was also split on the relationship between the tathāgatagarbha and ālayavijñāna. Fa-shang (495-580), representing the southern Yogacara, asserted that they were separate, that the alaya was illusiory and impure while buddha nature was the ultimate source of all phenomenal reality.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Seong-Uk Kim, Understanding Tsung-Mi's view on Buddha nature, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern school meanwhile, it was held that the alaya and buddha nature were the same pure support for all phenomena.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; In the sixth and seventh centuries, the Yogacara theory became associated with a substantialist non-dual metaphysics which saw buddha nature as an eternalistic ground. This idea was promoted by figures like [[Fazang]] and Ratnamati.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In contrast with the Chinese Yogacara view, the [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar [[Jizang]] (549–623 CE) sought to remove all ontological connotations of the term as a metaphysical reality and saw buddha nature as being synonymous with terms like "[[Tathātā|tathata]]," "[[dharmadhatu]]," "ekayana," "wisdom, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; "ultimate reality," "middle way" and also the wisdom that contemplates [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In formulating his view, Jizang was influenced by the earlier Chinese Madhyamaka thinker [[Sengzhao]] (384–414 CE) who was a key figure in outlining an understanding of emptiness which was based on the Indian sources and not on Daoist concepts which previous Chinese Buddhists had used.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Jizang used the compound “Middle Way-buddha nature” (''zhongdao foxing'' 中道佛 性) to refer to his view.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;CHIH-MIEN ADRIAN TSENG, A COMPARISON OF THE CONCEPTS OF BUDDHA-NATURE AND DAO-NATURE OF MEDIEVAL CHINA.&lt;/ref&gt; Jizang was also one of the first Chinese philosophers to famously argue that plants and insentient objects have Buddha nature, which he also termed true reality and universal principle (''dao'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the 20th century, the influential Chinese master [[Yin Shun]] drew on Chinese Madhyamaka to argue against any Yogacara influenced view that buddha nature was an underlying permanent ground of reality and instead supported the view that buddha nature teachings are just an expedient means.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Yin Shun, drawing on his study of Indian Madhyamaka promoted the emptiness of all things as the ultimate Buddhist truth, and argued that the buddha nature teaching was a provisional teaching taught in order to ease the fear of some Buddhists regarding emptiness as well as to attract those people who have an affinity to the idea of a Self or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Later after taking up the Buddhist path, they would be introduced to the truth of emptiness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== In Tiantai ===
In the [[Tiantai]] school, the primary figure is the scholar [[Zhiyi]]. According to Paul L. Swanson, none of Zhiyi's works discuss buddha nature explicitly at length however. Yet it is still an important concept in his philosophy, which is seen as synonymous with the [[Ekayāna|ekayana]] principle outlined in the [[Lotus Sutra]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Swanson, Paul L, T'ien-t'ai Chih-i's Concept of Threefold Buddha Nature-A Synergy of Reality, Wisdom, and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson argues that for Zhiyi, buddha nature is:&lt;blockquote&gt;an active threefold process which involves the way reality is, the wisdom to see reality as it is, and the practice required to attain this wisdom. Buddha Nature is threefold: the three aspects of reality, wisdom, and practice are interdependent--one aspect does not make any sense without the others.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Buddha nature for Zhiyi therefore has three aspects which he bases on passages from the [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus sutra]] and the Nirvana sutra:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

# The direct cause of attaining Buddhahood, the innate potential in all sentient beings to become Buddhas, which is the aspect of 'true nature', the way things are.
# The complete cause of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of wisdom that illuminates the true nature and the goal of practice.
# The conditional causes of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of the practices and activities that lead to Buddhahood.

The later Tiantai scholar [[Zhanran]] would expand the Tiantai view of buddha nature, which he saw as synonymous with [[Tathātā|suchness]], to argue for the idea that insentient rocks and plants also have buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;Shuman Chen. Buddha-Nature of Insentient Beings. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion , 2nd ed., vol. 1, pp. 208-212, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Chan Buddhism===
In [[Chan Buddhism]], buddha nature tends to be seen as the (non-substantial) essential nature of all beings. But the Zen tradition also emphasizes that buddha nature is [[śūnyatā]], the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai}}

''Ch'an and Zen Teaching First Series''.  Berkeley, CA.: Shambala publications: Part I: ''Master Hsu Yun's Discourses and Dharma Words'': pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; have all taught that the process of awakening begins with the light of the mind turning around within the 8th consciousness, so that the ''ālayavijñāna'', also known as the ''tathāgatagarbha'', is transformed into the "bright mirror wisdom". The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' presents the Chan/Zen Buddhist view of the ''tathāgatagarbha'':
{{quote|[The Buddha said,] Now, Mahāmati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one casts aside the discriminating notions of form, name, reality, and character; it is the inner realisation by noble wisdom. This perfect knowledge, Mahāmati, is the essence of the Tathāgata-garbha.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When this active transformation is complete, the other seven consciousnesses are also transformed. The 7th consciousness of delusive discrimination becomes transformed into the "equality wisdom". The 6th consciousness of thinking sense becomes transformed into the "profound observing wisdom", and the 1st to 5th consciousnesses of the five sensory senses become transformed into the "all-performing wisdom".

The Chan master [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788) developed a radical interpretation of buddha nature, famously stating that it was nothing less than ordinary mind and that all beings were already enlightened from the start.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

The influential Chan patriarch [[Guifeng Zongmi]] (780–841) interpreted Buddha nature as “empty tranquil awareness” (''k’ung-chi chih''), which he took from the Ho-tse school of Chan.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Following the Srimala sutra, he interpreted the theory of emptiness as presented in the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñaparamita]] sutras as provisional and saw buddha nature as the definitive teaching of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Heng-Ching Shih, the teaching of the universal Buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, Buddha-nature simply represents the potentiality to be realized in the future.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hsing Yun]], forty-eighth patriarch of the [[Linji school]], equates the Buddha-nature with the dharmakāya in line with pronouncements in key tathāgatagarbha sūtras. He defines these two as:
{{quote|the inherent nature that exists in all beings. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, enlightenment is a process of uncovering this inherent nature … The Buddha nature [is] identical with transcendental reality. The unity of the Buddha with everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Hsing Yun, Master; tr. by Tom Graham (1999). ''Being Good: Buddhist Ethics for Everyday Life''. New York: Weatherhill: pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ010/bj010146307.pdf 現代禪宗心性思想研究的幾點評論]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Korean Buddhism==
In the Korean ''[[Vajrasamadhi-sutra|Vajrasamādhi Sūtra]]'' (685 CE), the tathāgatagarbha is presented as being possessed of two elements, one essential, immutable, changeless and still, the other active and salvational:
{{quote|This "dharma of the one mind", which is the "original tathagatagarbha", is said to be "calm and motionless" ... The ''Vajrasamadhi'''s analysis of tathagatagarbha also recalls a distinction the Awakening of Faith makes between the calm, unchanging essence of the mind and its active, adaptable function [...] The tathagatagarbha is equated with the "original edge of reality" (''bhutakoti'') that is beyond all distinctions - the equivalent of original enlightenment, or the essence. But tathagatagarbha is also the active functioning of that original enlightenment - 'the inspirational power of that fundamental faculty' .... The tathagatagarbha is thus both the 'original edge of reality' that is beyond cultivation (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; essence) as well as the specific types of wisdom and mystical talents that are the byproducts of enlightenment (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; function).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E. Jr. (2007). ''Cultivating Original Enlightenment''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press: p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Japanese Buddhism==

===Nichiren Buddhism===
[[Nichiren]] (1222–1282) was a Buddhist monk who taught devotion to the ''Lotus Sutra'' as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment, and the chanting of [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]] as the essential practice of the teaching. [[Nichiren Buddhism]] includes various schools with diverging interpretations of Nichiren's teachings.

Nichiren Buddhism views the Buddha nature as "The inner potential for attaining Buddhahood", common to all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism |publisher=Soka Gakkai |year=2002 |location=Tōkyō |pages= |url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |doi= |id= |isbn=978-4-412-01205-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530075716/http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |archivedate=May 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Living Beings Possess Buddha Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; being the inherent potential to attain Buddhahood: "The Buddha nature refers to the potential for attaining Buddhahood, a state of awakening filled with compassion and wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es Freeing the caged bird within] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729152739/http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es |date=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in Nichiren Buddhism is on "revealing the Buddha nature" - or attaining Buddhahood – in this lifetime &lt;ref&gt;The Gosho Translation Committee: [http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=3 ''The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Volume I''], Tokyo: Soka Gakkai, 2006.  {{ISBN|4-412-01024-4}}; pp.3 - 5 (On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime)&lt;/ref&gt; through chanting the name of the Dharma of the Lotus Sutra: "[T]the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=887&amp;m=3&amp;q=When%20we%20revere%20Myoho-renge-kyo%20inherent When we rever Myoho-renge-kyo inherent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for Buddhahood exists in the whole spectrum of the [[Ten spiritual realms|Ten Worlds]] of life, and this means that all people, including evil doers, have Buddha nature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=923&amp;m=3&amp;q=all the beings Sokai Gakka International: All the beings]&lt;/ref&gt; which remains as a dormant possibility or a theoretical potential in the field of emptiness or non-substantiality until it is materialized in reality through Buddhist practice.

In his letter "Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=85 Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichiren explains that insentient matter (such as trees, mandalas, images, statues) also possess the Buddha nature, because they serve as objects of worship. This view regards the Buddha nature as the original nature of all manifestations of life – sentient and insentient – through their interconnectedness:
{{quote|This concept of the enlightenment of plants in turn derives from the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, which teaches that all life—insentient and sentient—possesses the Buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=89&amp;m=3&amp;q=the%20enlightenment%20of%20plants Enlightenment of plants]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Zen Buddhism===
The founder of the [[Sōtō school]] of [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Dōgen Zenji]], held that Buddha-nature (''busshō'' 佛性) was simply the true nature of reality and Being. This true nature was just impermanence, becoming and 'vast emptiness'. Because he saw the whole universe as an expression of Buddha-nature, he held that even grass and trees are Buddha nature. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich. Zen Buddhism, Volume 2: A History, "Section 2, Dogen" p. 51-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The founder of [[Sanbō Kyōdan]] lineage of Zen Buddhism, [[Hakuun Yasutani|Yasutani Haku'un Roshi]], also defined Buddha-nature in terms of the emptiness and impermanence of all dharmas:
{{quote|Everything by its very nature is subject to the process of infinite transformation - this is its Buddha- or Dharma-nature. 
What is the substance of this Buddha- or Dharma-nature? In Buddhism it is called ''ku'' (shunyata). Now, ''ku'' is not mere emptiness. It is that which is living, dynamic, devoid of mass, unfixed, beyond individuality or personality--the matrix of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kapleau. ''Three Pillars of Zen''. Anchor books, Doubleday. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A famous reference to Buddha-nature in the Zen-tradition is the [[Mu (negative)|Mu-koan]]:
{{quote|A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], a Chinese Zen master (known as ''Jōshū'' in Japanese), "Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?" Zhaozhou answered, "It does not."

===Shin Buddhism===
The founder of the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Shinran]], equated Buddha-Nature with [[shinjin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Shinran, 1997, Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan Buddhism==
{{Main|Rangtong|Shentong}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scholastics, there are two main camps of interpreting buddha nature. There are those who argue that ''tathāgatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as [[dharmadhatu]], the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation) and there are those who see it as the union of the mind's emptiness and luminosity (which includes the buddha qualities).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] favors what is called the ''[[Rangtong-Shentong|rangtong]]'' interpretation of [[Prasaṅgika]] Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107-108}} They thus interpret Buddha nature as an expedient term for the emptiness of inherent existence. Other schools, especially the [[Jonang]],{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} and [[Kagyu]] have tended to accept the [[shentong]], "other-empty", Madhyamaka philosophy, which discerns an Absolute which "is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}

These interpretations of the tathagatagarbha-teachings has been a matter of intensive debates in Tibet.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=105-109}}

===Gelug===
An early Tibetan translator, [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] (1050-1109) argues in his commentary to the Uttaratantra that Buddha nature is a non-implicative negation, which is to say that it is emptiness, as a ''total negation'' of inherent existence (''svabhava'') that does not imply that anything is left un-negated (in terms of its ''svabhava''). Another early figure, Chaba Chokyi Senge also argued that Buddha nature was a non-implicative negation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadampa]] tradition generally followed [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] by holding that Buddha nature was a nonimplicative negation. The [[Gelug]] school, which sees itself as a continuation of the Kadampas, also hold this view, while also holding, as Chaba did, that Buddha nature teachings are of expedient meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

[[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Kedrub Jé Geleg Balsang]] (1385-1438), one of the main disciples of Tsongkhapa, defined the tathāgatagarbha thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established that is called “the naturally pure true nature of the mind.” The naturally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains is called “sugata heart” or “naturally abiding disposition."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brunnholzl states that the view of [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen]] (1364-1432) is "that the tathàgata heart is the state of a being in whom mind's emptiness is obscured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathàgata heart."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] sees the Buddha-nature as the "original clear light of mind", but points out that it ultimately does not exist independently, because, like all other phenomena, it is of the nature of emptiness:
{{quote|Once one pronounces the words "emptiness" and "absolute", one has the impression of speaking of the same thing, in fact of the absolute. If emptiness must be explained through the use of just one of these two terms, there will be confusion. I must say this; otherwise you might think that the innate original clear light as absolute truth really exists.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama, the (1999). ''Buddha Heart, Buddha Mind''. New York: Crossroad: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sakya ===
[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-1251) sees the buddha nature as the [[dharmadhatu]] free from all reference points, and states that the teaching that buddha nature exists in all beings is of expedient meaning and that its basis is emptiness, citing [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya''.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sakya scholar Rongtön meanwhile, argued that buddha nature is [[Tathātā|suchness]], with stains, or [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] of the mind with stains.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakya scholar [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] (1290–1364), like the Gelugpas, held that the Buddha nature teachings were of expedient meaning and that that the naturally abiding disposition is nothing but emptiness, however unlike them, his view was that the basis for these teachings is the alaya-vijñana and also that buddha nature is the dharmakaya of a buddha but "never exists in the great mass of sentient beings".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brunnholzl, in the works of the influential Sakya scholar [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), buddha nature is &lt;blockquote&gt;"nondual unity of minds lucidity and emptiness or awareness and emptiness free from all reference points. It is not mere emptiness because sheer emptiness cannot be the basis of both samsára and nirvána. However, it is not mere lucidity either because this lucidity is a conditioned entity and the tathágata heart is unconditioned."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sakya Chokden]] meanwhile argues that the ultimate buddha nature is "minds natural luminosity free from all extremes of reference points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom and an implicative negation."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonang===
The [[Jonang]] school, whose foremost historical figure was the Tibetan scholar-monk [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361), sees the Buddha-nature as the very ground of the Buddha himself, as the "permanent indwelling of the Buddha in the basal state".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brunnholzl, Dolpopa, basing himself on certain ''tathāgatagarbha'' sutras, argued that the buddha nature is "ultimately really established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination."&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt; This is the foundation of what is called the [[Rangtong-Shentong|Shentong]] view.

Moreover, the Buddhist tantric scripture entitled ''Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī ({{IAST|Mañjuśrī-nāma-saṅgīti}})'', repeatedly exalts, as portrayed by Dolpopa, not the non-Self but the Self, and applies the following terms to this ultimate reality : 'The Buddha-Self, the beginningless Self, the solid Self, the diamond Self'. These terms are applied in a manner which reflects the cataphatic approach to Buddhism, typical of much of Dolpopa's writings.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cyrus Stearns writes that Dolpopa's attitude to the 'third turning of the wheel' doctrines (i.e. the Buddha-nature teachings) is that they "are the final definitive statements on the nature of ultimate reality, the primordial ground or substratum beyond the chain of dependent origination, and which is only empty of other, relative phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Cyrus Stearns, ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', State University of New York Press, Albany, 1999, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nyingma===
In the [[Nyingma]] school doctrines on buddha nature are generally marked by the tendency to align the idea with [[Dzogchen]] views as well as with [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|Prasangika]] [[Madhyamaka]], beginning with the work of [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo|Rongzom]] (1042-1136) and continuing into the work of [[Longchenpa]] (1308-1364) and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham (1846- 1912)]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]], the most authoritative figure in modern Nyingma, adopted a view of buddha nature as the unity of appearance and emptiness, relating it to the descriptions of the Ground in Dzogchen as outlined by Longchenpa. This ground is said to be primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (Ihun grub).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germano writes that Dzogchen "represents the most sophisticated interpretation of the so-called "Buddha nature" tradition within the context of Indo-Tibetan thought".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David Francis (1992). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185505/http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/Poetic%20thought%20-%20The%20Tantric%20synthesis%20of%20Dzogs%20Chen.pdf ''Poetic thought, the intelligent Universe, and the mystery of self: The Tantric synthesis of'' rDzogs Chen ''in fourteenth century Tibet''], The University of Wisconsin, Madison. Doctoral thesis. pp.viii - ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th/20th-century Nyingma scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:

{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] sees an identity between the Buddha-nature, [[Dharmadhatu|dharmadhātu]] (essence of all phenomena and the noumenon) and the [[Three Vajras]], saying:
{{quote|Dharmadhatu is adorned with dharmakaya, which is endowed with dharmadhatu wisdom. This is a brief but very profound statement, because "dharmadhatu" also refers to sugata-garbha or buddha nature. Buddha nature is all-encompassing ... This buddha nature is present just as the shining sun is present in the sky. It is indivisible from the three vajras [i.e. the Buddha's Body, Speech and Mind] of the awakened state, which do not perish or change.&lt;ref&gt;Urgyen Rinpoche, Tulku (1999). ''As It Is''. Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Books: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The Nyingma meditation masters, [[Palden Sherab|Khenchen Palden Sherab]] and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal, emphasise that the essential nature of the mind (the Buddha-nature) is not a blankness, but is characterized by wonderful qualities and a non-conceptual perfection that is already present and complete, it's just obscured and we fail to recognize it.&lt;ref&gt;Sherab, Khenchen Palden and Dongyal, Khenpo Tsewang (2006). ''Opening to Our Primordial Nature''. New York: Snow Lion: pp. 3, 9, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the context of Nyingma, [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche|Dzogchen Ponlop]] expresses the view that there exists within vajrayana Buddhism the doctrine that we are already buddha: ‘... in the vajrayana, we are buddha ''right now'', in this very moment’&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, Mind Beyond Death, Snow Lion publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is legitimate to have ‘vajra pride’ in our buddha mind and the already present qualities of enlightenment with which it is replete:
{{quote|Vajra pride refers to our pride and confidence in the absolute nature of our mind as buddha: primordially, originally pure, awake and full of the qualities of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, ''Mind Beyond Death'', Snow Lion Publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Kagyu====
According to Brunnholzl,&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually all [[Kagyu]] masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathagata heart is just sheer emptiness or a nonimplicative negation. Though the Kagyu approach has certain similarities with Dolpopa's view, it is generally less absolute than the latter's and shows several significant differences, such as not claiming that the buddha qualities exist in their full-blown form even in confused sentient beings and not making such an absolute distinction between the two realities as Dolpopa does (the exception is [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye]], who largely follows [[Taranatha]] and Dolpopa but at times blends their positions with the [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Third Karmapa's]] view).&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Kagyu the view of the Third Karmapa is generally seen as the most authoritative. This is the view that buddha nature is "mind's luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsara and nirvana."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] sees the Buddha nature as the indivisible oneness of wisdom and emptiness:
{{quote|The union of wisdom and emptiness is the essence of Buddha-hood or what is called Buddha-nature (Skt. ''Tathagata-garbha'') because it contains the very seed, the potential of Buddhahood. It resides in each and every being and because of this essential nature, this heart nature, there is the possibility of reaching Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenchen. [http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html ''Buddha Nature and Buddhahood: the Mahayana and Tantra Yana''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230142513/http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Rimé movement===
The Rimé movement is an ecumenical movement in Tibet which started as an attempt to reconcile the various Tibetan schools in the 19th century. In contrast to the Gelugpa, which adheres to the ''rang stong'', "self-empty", or Prasaṅgika point of view,{{refn|Which states that all existences are empty of a "self-nature"}} the Rimé movement supports ''shen tong'' (''gzhan tong''), "other-empty", an essential nature which is "pure radiant non-dual consciousness".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] says about the two systems:{{quote|Madhyamika philosophies have no differences in realising as 'Shunyata', all phenomena that we experience on a relative level. They have no differences also, in reaching the meditative state where all extremes (ideas) completely dissolve. Their difference lies in the words they use to describe the [[Dharmata]]. Shentong describes the Dharmata, the mind of Buddha, as 'ultimately real'; while Rangtong philosophers fear that if it is described that way, people might understand it as the concept of 'soul' or 'Atma'. The Shentong philosopher believes that there is a more serious possibility of misunderstanding in describing the Enlightened State as 'unreal' and 'void'. Kongtrul finds the Rangtong way of presentation the best to dissolve concepts and the Shentong way the best to describe the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Ringu%20Tulku/The%20Rime%20Movement/THE%20RIME%20(%20Ris-med%20)%20MOVEMENT.htm Ringu Tulku: The Rimé (Ris-med) movement of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship points to the various possible interpretations of Buddha Nature as either an essential self, as [[Sunyata]], or as the ''inherent possibility'' of awakening.

===Essential self===
Shenpen Hookham, Oxford Buddhist scholar and Tibetan lama of the Shentong tradition writes of the Buddha-nature or "true self" as something real and permanent, and already present within the being as uncompounded enlightenment. She calls it "the Buddha within", and comments:
{{quote|In scriptural terms, there can be no real objection to referring to Buddha, Buddhajnana [Buddha Awareness/ Buddha Knowledge], Nirvana and so forth as the True Self, unless the concept of Buddha and so forth being propounded can be shown to be impermanent, suffering, compounded, or imperfect in some way ... in Shentong terms, the non-self is about what is ''not'' the case, and the Self of the Third Dharmachakra [i.e. the Buddha-nature doctrine] is about what truly IS.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Shenpen (1991). ''The Buddha Within''. State University of New York Press: p.&amp;nbsp;104, p.&amp;nbsp;353&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buddhist scholar and chronicler, Merv Fowler, writes that the Buddha-nature really is present as an essence within each being. Fowler comments:
{{quote|The teaching that Buddha-nature is the hidden essence within all sentient beings is the main message of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, the earliest of which is the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''. This short sutra says that all living beings are in essence identical to the Buddha regardless of their defilements or their continuing transmigration from life to life... As in the earlier traditions, there is present the idea that enlightenment, or nirvana, is not something which has to be achieved, it is something which is already there... In a way, it means that everyone is really a Buddha ''now''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Merv (1999). ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices''. Sussex Academic Press: pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sunyata===
According to Heng-Ching Shih, the ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha-nature does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness (''śūnyatā''), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. The intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Paul Williams]] puts forward the Madhyamaka interpretation of the Buddha-nature as emptiness in the following terms:
{{quote|… if one is a Madhyamika then that which enables sentient beings to become buddhas must be the very factor that enables the minds of sentient beings to change into the minds of Buddhas. That which enables things to change is their simple absence of inherent existence, their emptiness. Thus the tathagatagarbha becomes emptiness itself, but specifically emptiness when applied to the mental continuum.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=164-165}}}}

===Critical Buddhist interpretation===
Several contemporary Japanese Buddhist scholars, headed under the label [[Critical Buddhism]] (''hihan bukky''ō, 批仏教), have been critical of Buddha-nature thought. According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki of [[Komazawa University]], essentialist conceptions of Buddha-nature are at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of [[dependent origination]] and non-self ([[Anatta|''anātman'']]'')''.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto Shirõ (1997). ''The Doctrine of Tathagata-garbha Is Not Buddhist. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakamaya Noriaki (1997). ''Critical Philosophy Versus Topical Philosophy'', in: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha nature doctrines which they label as ''dhātuvāda'' (“substantialism,”sometimes rendered “locus theory” or “topicalism”) and “generative monism” is not Buddhism at all.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p.&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by Matsumoto, this "locus" theory or ''dhātuvāda'' which he rejects as un-buddhist is:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the theory that the single (''eka, sama'') existent “locus” (''dhatu'') or basis is the cause that produces the manifold phenomena or “super-loci” (''dharmah'').&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Shiro Matsumoto, Critiques of Tathagatagarbha Thought and Critical Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Matsumoto further argues that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Tathagatagarbha thought was a Buddhist version of [[Advaita Vedanta|Hindu monism]], formed by the influence of [[Hinduism]] gradually introduced into Buddhism, especially after the rise of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other Japanese scholars responded to this view leading to a lively debate in Japan. Takasaki Jikido, a well known authority on ''tathagathagarbha'' thought, accepted that Buddha nature theories are similar to Upanishadic theories and that ''dhātuvāda'' is an accurate expression of the structure of these doctrines'','' but argues that the Buddha nature texts are aware of this and that Buddha nature is not necessarily un-Buddhist or anti-Buddhist.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Swanson, Paul L. Why They Say Zen is Not Buddhism: Recent Japanese Critiques of Buddha-Nature. http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/What_and_why_of_Critical_Buddhism_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Likewise, Hirakawa Akira, sees Buddha nature as the potential to attain Buddhahood which not static but ever changing and argues that "''dhātu''" does not necessarily mean substratum (he points to some [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] which identify ''dhatu'' with [[Pratītyasamutpāda|''pratitya-samutpada'']]).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Western scholars have reacted in different ways to this idea. Sallie B. King objects to their view, seeing the Buddha-nature as a metaphor for the potential in all beings to attain Buddhahood, rather than as an ontological reality.&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp2"&gt;Sallie B. King (1997), ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist''. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert H. Sharf notes that the worries of the Critical Buddhists is nothing new, for "the early ''tathāgatagarbha'' scriptures betray a similar anxiety, as they tacitly acknowledge that the doctrine is close to, if not identical with, the heretical ātmavāda teachings of the non- Buddhists."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p. http://www.academia.edu/27749171/Buddha-nature_Critical_Buddhism_and_Early_Chan&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes how the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|''Nirvāṇa-sūtra'']] "tacitly concedes the non-Buddhist roots of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' idea."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Sharf also has pointed out how certain Southern Chan masters were concerned with other interpretations of Buddha nature, showing how the tendency to critique certain views of Buddha nature is not new in East Asian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Peter N. Gregory has also argued that at least some East Asian interpretations of Buddha nature are equivalent to what Critical Buddhists call ''dhātuvāda,'' especially the work of [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], who "emphasizes the underlying ontological ground on which all phenomenal appearances (''hsiang'') are based, which he variously refers to as the nature (''hsing''), the one mind (''i-hsin'')...".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N. Is Critical Buddhism Really Critical? in ''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism'' https://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/Critical_Buddhism_Gregory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], certain [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] ideologies which became dominant in the 8th century promoted the idea of an "underlying metaphysical substratum" or "underlying, invariant, universal metaphysical 'source'" and thus do seem to be a kind of ''dhātuvāda.'' According to Lusthaus "in early T’ang China (7th–8th century) there was a deliberate attempt to divorce Chinese Buddhism from developments in India." Lusthaus notes that the Huayen thinker [[Fazang|Fa-tsang]] was influential in this theological trend who promoted the idea that true Buddhism was about comprehending the "One Mind that alone is the ground of reality" (''wei- hsin).''&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan, Critical Buddhism and Returning to the Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams too has criticised this view, saying that Critical Buddhism is too narrow in its definition of what constitutes Buddhism. According to Williams, "We should abandon any simplistic identification of Buddhism with a straightforward not-Self definition".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, London, 2nd Edition, 2009, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings===
Sutton agrees with Williams' critique on the narrowness of any single interpretation. In discussing the inadequacy of modern scholarship on Buddha-nature, Sutton states, 
{{quote|One is impressed by the fact that these authors, as a rule, tend to opt for a single meaning disregarding all other possible meanings which are embraced in turn by other texts".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Florin Giripescu (1991). ''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra''. SUNY ({{ISBN|0-7914-0172-3}}): p.51&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He goes on to point out that the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' has up to six possible connotations. Of these, he says the three most important are:
#an underlying ontological reality or essential nature (''tathāgata-tathatā-'vyatireka'') which is functionally equivalent to a ''self'' (''ātman'') in an ''[[Upanishad]]ic'' sense,
#the ''dharma-kāya'' which penetrates all beings (''sarva-sattveṣu dharma-kāya-parispharaṇa''), which is functionally equivalent to [[brahman]] in an ''Upanishadic'' sense
#the womb or matrix of Buddhahood existing in all beings ''(tathāgata-gotra-saṃbhava''), which provides beings with the possibility of awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Takasaki, Jikido (1991). ''A Study on the Ratnagotravibhāga''. ISMEO 1966: p.198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florin Giripescu Sutton, ''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra'', SUNY({{ISBN|0-7914-0172-3}}): p.53&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these three, Sutton claims that only the third connotation has any soteriological significance, while the other two posit Buddha-nature as an ontological reality and essential nature behind all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex (1981). The Title and Textual Affiliation of the Guhya-garbha Tantra. In: ''From Mahayana Buddhism to Tantra — Felicitation Volume for Dr Shunkyo Matsumata''. Tokyo: p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camille Utterback''' (born 1970 in Bloomington, Indiana) is an internationally acclaimed interactive installation artist. Initially trained as a painter, her work is at the intersection of [[painting]] and [[interactive art]].

==Biography==
[[File:Camille Utterback.jpg|thumb|left|One of Camille Utterback's installations]]

Utterback received her undergraduate degree from [[Williams College]] and her master's degree from the [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. She is currently an Assistant Professor of the Art and Art History Department at [[Stanford University]] and lives in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California.]]

Examples of her work include ''Text Rain'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2003). ''Digital Art'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20367-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camilleutterback.com/textrain.html&lt;/ref&gt; created in collaboration with [[Romy Achituv]], in which participants use their bodies to lift and play with falling letters projected on a wall, and ''Shifting Times'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://camilleutterback.com/projects/shifting-time-san-jose/&lt;/ref&gt; a public installation in San Jose, California that creates interactive projects based on the movements of pedestrians. Helen Lessick describes the latter as a "blending screens of twentieth and twenty-first century San José" in which the "images split and weave, shift between color and black and white, invoking loss and possibility, site and memory." &lt;ref name="Public Art Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessick|first=Helen|title=Beta Test: Innovation in administration at San Jose, California's Norman Y. Mineta Airport|journal=PublicArtReview|date=Spring–Summer 2011|volume=1|series=2|issue=44|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterback says that she is interested in getting people to “think about the difference between something conceptual and something physical” and to “make a hypothesis, and then test it with their bodies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Art Installations Find Fertile Ground in Science Centers|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19TECH.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-03-17|access-date = 2015-07-25|issn = 0362-4331|first = Julia M.|last = Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her work has been exhibited at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] (New York), the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] (New York), [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] (Washington, D.C.)&lt;ref name=SAAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Rain|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=109552|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GAFFTA]] (San Francisco), the [[Ars Electronica Center]] (Linz, Austria) and the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] (Tokyo, Japan).

Due to the multiple benefits from [[cattle]], there are varying beliefs about cattle in societies and [[religion]]s. In some regions, especially [[Nepal]] and most [[Cattle slaughter in India|states of India]], the slaughter of cattle is prohibited and their meat may be [[food and drink prohibitions|taboo]].

Cattle are considered sacred in world religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and others. Religions in [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]], and [[ancient Germany]] held similar beliefs.

According to Nanditha Krishna, the cow veneration in ancient India during the Vedic era, the religious texts written during this period called for non-violence towards all bipeds and quadrupeds, and often equated killing of a cow with the killing of a human being especially a [[Brahmin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=80, 101–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanditha Krishna stated that the hymn 8.3.25 of the Hindu scripture ''Atharvaveda'' (~1200–1500 BCE) condemns all killings of men, cattle, and horses, and prays to god [[Agni]] to punish those who kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&amp;pg=PT108 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=15, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.८७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.८७], Wikisource, Quote: "यः पौरुषेयेण क्रविषा समङ्क्ते यो अश्व्येन पशुना यातुधानः । यो अघ्न्याया भरति क्षीरमग्ने तेषां शीर्षाणि हरसापि वृश्च ॥१६॥"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ludwig Alsdorf, "Indian vegetarianism is unequivocally based on ''ahimsa'' (non-violence)" as evidenced by ancient ''[[smriti]]s'' and other ancient texts of Hinduism.

The reverence for the cow played a role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the [[British East India Company]]. Hindu and Muslim [[sepoy]]s in the army of the East India Company came to believe that their [[paper cartridge]]s, which held a measured amount of gunpowder, were greased with cow and pig fat. The consumption of swine is forbidden in [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. Because loading the gun required biting off the end of the paper cartridge, they concluded that the [[British India|British]] were forcing them to break edicts of their religion.&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People |author=W. and R.

====In Gandhi's teachings====
The cow protection was a symbol of animal rights and of non-violence against all life forms for Gandhi. He [[veneration|venerated]] cows, and suggested ending cow slaughter to be the first step to stopping violence against all animals.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch2/an2.6.htm |title=Compilation of Gandhi's views on Cow Protection |publisher=Dahd.nic.in |date=7 July 1927 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125093504/http://dahd.nic.in/ch2/an2.6.htm |archivedate=25 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "I worship it and I shall defend its worship against the whole world", and stated that "The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection."&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; 
Yet even Gandhi never called for the banning of cow slaughter in India. He said,

“How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.”

===Jainism===
{{See also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] is against violence to all living beings, including cattle. According to the Jaina sutras, humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings are fond of life, they suffer, they feel pain, they like to live, and long to live. All beings should help each other live and prosper, according to Jainism, not kill and slaughter each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan J. Armstrong|author2=Richard G.

===Buddhism===
The texts of [[Buddhism]] state [[ahimsa]] to be one of five ethical precepts, which requires a practicing Buddhist to "refrain from killing living beings".&lt;ref name="Kemmerer2011p100"/&gt; Slaughtering cow has been a taboo, with some texts suggest taking care of a cow is a means of taking care of "all living beings".

cows are our kin most excellent from whom come many remedies.

Meat eating remains controversial within Budhhism, with most Theravada sects allowing it, reflecting early Buddhist practise, and most Mayahayana sects forbidding it. Early Suttas indicate that the Buddha himself ate meat and was clear that no rule should be introduced to forbid meat eating to monks.The consumption, however, appears to have been limited to pork, chicken and fish and may well have excluded cattle. &lt;ref&gt;Buddhism and Vegetarianism  The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat by Dr V.

Some Jews committed to [[Jewish vegetarianism]] believe that the logical conclusion to the Jewish rules for animal care and slaughter is to refrain from slaughtering animals altogether .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jewishveg.org/rabbinic-statement|title=Rabbinic Statement|work=Jewish Veg|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Further|Animals in Islam}}

[[Islam]] allows the slaughter of cows and consumption of [[beef]], as long as the cow is slaughtered in a religious ritual called [[dhabihah|''dhabīḥah'' or ''zabiha'']] [[comparison of Islamic and Jewish dietary laws#Similarities 2|similar]] to the Jewish ''[[shechita]]''.

Although slaughter of cattle plays a role in a major Muslim holiday, [[Eid al-Adha]], many rulers of the [[Mughal Empire]] had imposed a ban on the slaughter of cows owing to the large Hindu and Jain populations living under their rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha Craven|title=The Clash Within: Democracy, Religious Violence, and India's Future|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and longest surah of the Quran is named [[Al-Baqara]] ("The Cow"). Out of the 286 verses of the surah, 7 mention cows (Al Baqarah 67–73).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI6cH3mZCUyAIVRI6OCh2ZtQfd#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|author= Diane Morgan|publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]]|year= 2010|page= 27|isbn= 9780313360251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=O84eYLVHvB0C&amp;pg=PA364&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBmoVChMIvO-5zJiUyAIV1waOCh2PNgmC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Dictionary of Islam|author= [[Thomas Hughes (priest)|Thomas Hughes]]|publisher= [[Asian Educational Services]]|year= 1995|origyear=first published in 1885|page= 364|isbn= 9788120606722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the surah derives from this passage in which [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] orders his people to sacrifice a cow in order to resurrect a man murdered by an unknown person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9GTnBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj97fmj_5_UAhVFMI8KHY_DCVA4ChDoAQhAMAc#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Constructing the Image of Muhammad in Europe|author= Avinoam Shalem|publisher= [[Walter de Gruyter]]|year= 2013|page= 127|isbn= 9783110300864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the passage, the "[[Children of Israel]]" quibbled over what kind of cow was meant when the sacrifice was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=YYxSAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZs4_ShKDUAhXKto8KHZd_Dig4ChDoAQg-MAc#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title= Logic, Rhetoric and Legal Reasoning in the Qur'an: God's Arguments|author= Rosalind Ward Gwynne|publisher= [[Routledge]]|year= 2014|page= 38|isbn= 9781134344994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Sunni and Shia commentators recount several variants of this tale.

==Ancient Egypt==
The ancient Egyptians sacrificed animals but not the cow, because it was sacred to goddess [[Hathor]], and due to the contemporary Greek myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who had the form of a cow.&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis and summary of Herodotus, with a synchronistical table of principal events; tables of weights, measures, money, and distances; an outline of the history and geography; and the dates completed from Gaisford, Baehr, etc.'', by J. Talboys Wheeler'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Hesat]] was the manifestation of Hathor, the divine sky-cow, in earthly form. Like Hathor, she was seen as the wife of [[Ra]]. In [[hieroglyph]]s, she is depicted as a [[list of hieroglyphs/E|cow with a headdress]].

[[Apis bull]]

==Ancient Europe==
*In [[Celtic mythology]], the cattle goddess was known as [[Damona]] in [[Celtic Gaul]] and [[Boann]] in [[Celtic Ireland]].
*In [[Greek mythology]], [[the Cattle of Helios]] pastured on the island of [[Thrinacia]], which is believed to be modern [[Sicily]]. [[Helios]], the sun god, is said to have had seven herds of oxen and seven flocks of sheep, each numbering fifty head. A [[hecatomb]] was a sacrifice to the gods Apollo, Athena, and Hera, of 100 cattle (''hekaton'' = one hundred).
*In [[Norse mythology]], the primeval cow [[Auðumbla]] suckled the ancestor of the [[Ymir|Frost Giants]], [[Ymir]], and licked [[Odin]]'s grandfather, [[Búri]], out of the ice.
*Among the [[Visigoths]], the oxen pulling the wagon with the corpse of [[Emilian of Cogolla|Saint Emilian]] lead to the correct burial site ([[San Millán de la Cogolla, La Rioja]]).

==Modern day==

[[File:Well-loved cow, Delhi.jpg|thumb|A cow walking in Delhi.]]
Today, in Hindu-majority countries like India and Nepal, bovine milk holds a key part of religious rituals. For some, it is customary to boil milk on a stove or lead a cow through the house as part of a housewarming ceremony. In honor of their exalted status, cows often roam free, even along (and in) busy streets in major cities such as Delhi. In some places, it is considered good luck to give one a snack or fruit before breakfast.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===In India===
{{Main|Cattle slaughter in India}}
Constitution of India mandates the protection of cows in India.&lt;ref name="Margo" /&gt; The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a 'fit-for-slaughter' certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |title=ANNEX II (8) |publisher=Dahd.nic.in |date=30 August 1976 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109104315/http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has created communal disharmony in India and frequently leads to unwanted incidents.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Gopastami]], a holiday celebrated by the [[Hinduism|Hindus]] once a year, is one of the few instances where cows receive prayers in modern-day India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tadeusz|first1=Margul|title=Present Day Worship Of The Cow In India|journal=ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials|date=1968|volume=15|issue=1|pages=63–80|publisher=Numen}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the cow is still respected and honored by most of the Indian population, there has been controversy over the treatment of the cows during the holiday.

===In Nepal===
In Nepal, the cow is the national animal. Cows give milk from which the people produce dahi (yogurt), [[ghee]], butter, etc. In Nepal, a Hindu-majority country, slaughtering of cows and bulls is completely banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=4+held+for+violating+ban+on+cow+slaughter&amp;NewsID=293225 4 held for violating ban on cow slaughter], The Himalayan Times&lt;/ref&gt; Cows are considered like the Goddess [[Lakshmi]] (goddess of wealth and prosperity). The Nepalese have a festival called Tihar (Diwali) during which, on one day called Gaipuja, they perform prayers for cows.

According to a [[Lodi News-Sentinel]] news story written in the 1960s, in then contemporary [[Nepal]]  an individual could serve three months in jail for killing a pedestrian, but one year for injuring a cow, and life imprisonment for killing a cow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oegzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5O4HAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=india%20cow%20killing%20life-imprisonment&amp;pg=6924%2C2401380 |title=Injured cow in Nepal is serious matter |publisher=[[Yahoo!

===In Myanmar===
The beef taboo is fairly widespread in Myanmar, particularly in the Buddhist community. In Myanmar, beef is typically obtained from cattle that are slaughtered at the end of their working lives (16 years of age) or from sick animals.&lt;ref name="dev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Devendra,|first=C.|author2=Devendra, C.|author3=Thomas, D.|author4=Jabbar, M.A.|author5=Kudo, H.|author6=Thomas, D.|author7=Jabbar, M.A.|author8=Kudo, H.|title=Improvement of livestock production in crop-animal systems in rainfed agro-ecological zones of South-East Asia|publisher=ILRI|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle is rarely raised for meat; 58% of cattle in the country is used for draught animal power (DAP).&lt;ref name="dev"/&gt; Few people eat beef, and there is a general dislike of beef (especially among the [[Bamar]] and [[Burmese Chinese]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gesteland|first=Richard R.|author2=Georg F.

During the country's last dynasty, the [[Konbaung dynasty]], habitual consumption of beef was punishable by public [[flogging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardiman|first=John Percy|title=Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States|publisher=Government of Burma|year=1900|volume=2|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, [[Ledi Sayadaw]], a prominent [[Buddhist monk]] wrote the ''Nwa-myitta-sa'' ({{my|နွားမေတ္တာစာ}}), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, because Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle, and that the practice and was ecologically unsound.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charney|first=Michael|title=A history of natural resources in Asia: the wealth of nature|editor=Greg Bankoff, P.

On 29 August 1961, the [[Hluttaw|Burmese Parliament]] passed the State Religion Promotion Act of 1961, which explicitly banned the slaughtering of cattle nationwide (beef became known as ''todo tha'' ({{my|တိုးတိုးသား}}); lit. hush hush meat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Winston L.|title=In the hope of Nibbana: the ethics of Theravada Buddhism|publisher=Pariyatti|year=2001|volume=2|page=295|isbn=978-1-928706-08-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious groups, such as Muslims, were required to apply for exemption licences to slaughter cattle on religious holidays. This ban was repealed a year later, after [[Ne Win]] led a [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|coup d'état]] and declared martial law in the country.

===In Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], in May 2013, 30-year-old Buddhist monk Bowatte Indrarathana Thera of the Sri Sugatha Purana Vihara self immolated to protest the government allowing religious minorities to slaughter cows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/172-opinion/30146-fervour-that-ended-in-a-fatal-fire.html Fervour that ended in a fatal fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
A beef taboo in [[History of China|Ancient China]], known as ''niú jiè'' (牛戒), was historically a dietary restriction, particularly among the [[Han Chinese]], as oxen and buffalo (bovines) are useful in farming and are respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Paul R.|title=Divine justice: religion and the development of Chinese legal culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|year=2008|series=Academia Sinica on East Asia|page=56|isbn=978-0-415-44345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], they were not often eaten, even by emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Classic of Rites]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some emperors banned killing cows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economy.guoxue.com/article.php/9477 民間私營養牛業(附私營牧駝業)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813121422/http://economy.guoxue.com/article.php/9477 |date=13 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eywedu.com/Huizuyanjiu/hzyj2007/hzyj20070208.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beef is not recommended in [[Chinese medicine]], as it is considered a hot food and is thought to disrupt the body's internal balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Wendy|title=Singapore food|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|page=144|isbn=978-981-261-321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In written sources (including anecdotes and Daoist liturgical texts), this taboo first appeared in the 9th to 12th centuries ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]]-[[Song dynasty|Song]] transition, with the advent of pork meat.&lt;ref name="ster"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterckx|first=Roel|title=Of tripod and palate: food, politics and religion in traditional China – Chapter 11, The Beef Taboo and the Sacrificial Structure of Late Imperial Chinese Society, Vincent Goossaert|publisher=Macmillan|year=2005|pages=237–248|isbn=978-1-4039-6337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) By the 16th to 17th centuries, the beef taboo had become well accepted in the framework of Chinese morality and was found in morality books (善書), with several books dedicated exclusively to this taboo.&lt;ref name="ster"/&gt; The beef taboo came from a Chinese perspective that relates the respect for animal life and vegetarianism (ideas shared by [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Daoism]], and state protection for draught animals.&lt;ref name="ster"/&gt;) In Chinese society, only ethnic and religious groups not fully assimilated (such as the Muslim [[Hui people|Huis]] and the [[Miao people|Miao]]) and foreigners consumed this meat.&lt;ref name="ster"/&gt; This taboo, among Han Chinese, led [[Chinese Muslims]] to create a niche for themselves as butchers who specialized in slaughtering oxen and buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elverskog|first=Johan |title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|page=240|isbn=978-0-8122-4237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Historically, there was a beef taboo in [[Ancient Japan]], as a means of protecting the livestock population and due to Buddhist influence.&lt;ref name="cwi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cwiertka|first=Katarzyna Joanna|title=Modern Japanese cuisine: food, power, and national identity|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86189-298-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat-eating had long been taboo in Japan, beginning with a decree in 675 that banned the consumption of cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens, influenced by the Buddhist prohibition of killing.&lt;ref name="lien"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lien|first=Marianne E.|author2=Brigitte Nerlich|title=The politics of food|publisher=Berg|year=2004|pages=125–127|isbn=978-1-85973-853-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1612, the shōgun declared a decree that specifically banned the killing of cattle.&lt;ref name="lien"/&gt;

This official prohibition was in place until 1872, when it was officially proclaimed that [[Emperor Meiji]] consumed beef and mutton, which transformed the country's dietary considerations as a means of modernizing the country, particularly with regard to consumption of beef.&lt;ref name="lien"/&gt; With contact from Europeans, beef increasingly became popular, even though it had previously been considered barbaric.&lt;ref name="cwi"/&gt;

===Indonesia===
In [[Kudus Regency|Kudus]], [[Indonesia]], [[Muslim]]s still maintain the tradition of not slaughtering or eating cows, out of respect for their ancestors, who were [[Hindu]]s, allegedly imitating [[Sunan Kudus]] who also did as such.

==Leather==
In religiously diverse countries, leather vendors are typically careful to clarify the kinds of leather used in their products. For example, leather shoes will bear a label identifying the animal from which the leather was taken. In this way, a [[Muslim]] would not accidentally purchase [[leather|pigskin]] leather,&lt;ref&gt;"Global Business Strategies: Text and Cases" by U.C. Mathur, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Hindu]] could avoid [[cow]] leather. Many Hindus who are vegetarians will not use any kind of leather.

[[Judaism]] forbids the wearing of shoes made with leather on [[Yom Kippur]], [[Tisha B'Av]], and during mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281605/jewish/Wearing-Shoes.htm
|title=Wearing Shoes – Mourning Observances of Shiva and Sheloshim
|publisher=Chabad.org
|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jainism]] prohibits the use of leather because it is obtained by killing animals.

From the end of the [[Second World War]] to the beginning of the [[McCarthy era]] (1945–1950), the American professional theatre produced twenty shows on civil rights, nine of them on Broadway. 

Off-Broadway and out of town shows displayed a wider array of moral stances, ranging from gentle persuasion of ''Florence'' (1949) by [[Alice Childress]] and the religious fervor of ''[[Trial by Fire (play)|Trial by Fire]]'' (1947) by [[George Dunne (priest)|George Dunne]] to the activism of ''Earth and Stars'' (1946) by [[Randolph Edmonds]].

While musicals dominated commercial theatre in the 1940s, four dramas about the African Americans addressed the nations racial dilemma. The first, [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s, ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger’s brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]], a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Houseman]] and [[Orson Welles]] preferred Wright’s original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger’s character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. [[Canada Lee]] created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America’s declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation’s attention. 

The second civil rights drama, ''Strange Fruit'' (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith’s controversial novel. Staged by José Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old [[Jane White]] as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by [[Mel Ferrer]]. Other Blacks in the cast were [[Juano Hernandez]], Edna Thomas, [[Alonzo Bosan]], [[Ken Renard]], and [[Dorothy Carter]]. [[Robert Earl Jones]] played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, “My Day.” 

After the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. [[Abbie Mitchell]], [[Augustus Smith (actor)|Augustus Smith]], and [[Peter Morell]] played the members of Lee’s family. [[Margo Jones]], from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by [[Maxine Wood]]. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt’s help and that of [[Langston Hughes]], the play remained alive for 148 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre.

{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''cokernel''' of a [[linear mapping]] of [[vector spaces]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''Y''/im(''f'') of the [[codomain]] of ''f'' by the image of ''f''. The dimension of the cokernel is called the ''corank'' of ''f''.

Cokernels are [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to the [[kernel (category theory)|kernels of category theory]], hence the name: the kernel is a [[subobject]] of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a [[quotient object]] of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).

Intuitively, given an equation ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'' that one is seeking to solve,
the cokernel measures the ''constraints'' that ''y'' must satisfy for this equation to have a solution – the obstructions to a solution – while the kernel measures the ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if one exists. This is elaborated in [[#Intuition|intuition]], below.

More generally, the cokernel of a [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in some [[category theory|category]] (e.g. a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] between [[group (mathematics)|group]]s or a [[bounded linear operator]] between [[Hilbert space]]s) is an object ''Q'' and a morphism ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' such that the composition ''q f'' is the [[zero morphism]] of the category, and furthermore ''q'' is [[universal mapping property|universal]] with respect to this property. Often the map ''q'' is understood, and ''Q'' itself is called the cokernel of ''f''.

In many situations in [[abstract algebra]], such as for [[abelian group]]s, [[vector space]]s or [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, the cokernel of the [[homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[quotient set|quotient]] of ''Y'' by the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''. In [[topology|topological]] settings, such as with bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces, one typically has to take the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the image before passing to the quotient.

== Formal definition ==
One can define the cokernel in the general framework of [[category theory]]. In order for the definition to make sense the category in question must have [[zero morphism]]s. The '''cokernel''' of a [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is defined as the [[coequalizer]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism 0&lt;sub&gt;''XY''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''Y''.

Explicitly, this means the following. The cokernel of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is an object ''Q'' together with a morphism ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' such that the diagram

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:Cokernel-01.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;

[[commutative diagram|commutes]]. Moreover, the morphism ''q'' must be [[universal property|universal]] for this diagram, i.e. any other such ''q''&amp;prime;: ''Y'' → ''Q''&amp;prime; can be obtained by composing ''q'' with a unique morphism ''u'' : ''Q'' → ''Q''&amp;prime;:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:Cokernel-02.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;

As with all universal constructions the cokernel, if it exists, is unique [[up to]] a unique [[isomorphism]], or more precisely: if ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' and ''q‘'' : ''Y'' → ''Q‘'' are two cokernels of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', then there exists a unique isomorphism ''u'' : ''Q'' → ''Q‘'' with ''q‘'' = ''u'' ''q''.

Like all coequalizers, the cokernel ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' is necessarily an [[epimorphism]]. Conversely an epimorphism is called ''[[normal morphism|normal]]'' (or ''conormal'') if it is the cokernel of some morphism. A category is called ''conormal'' if every epimorphism is normal (e.g. the [[category of groups]] is conormal).

=== Examples ===
In the [[category of groups]], the cokernel of a [[group homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H'' is the [[quotient group|quotient]] of ''H'' by the [[Normal closure (group theory)|normal closure]] of the image of ''f''. In the case of [[abelian group]]s, since every [[subgroup]] is normal, the cokernel is just ''H'' [[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]] the image of ''f'':
:coker(''f'') =  ''H'' / im(''f'').

=== Special cases ===
In a [[preadditive category]], it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms. In such a category, the [[coequalizer]] of two morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' (if it exists) is just the cokernel of their difference:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coeq}(f, g) = \operatorname{coker}(g - f).&lt;/math&gt;

In an [[abelian category]] (a special kind of preadditive category) the [[image (category theory)|image]] and [[coimage]] of a morphism ''f'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \operatorname{im}(f) &amp;= \ker(\operatorname{coker} f), \\
  \operatorname{coim}(f) &amp;= \operatorname{coker}(\ker f).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, every abelian category is normal (and conormal as well). That is, every [[monomorphism]] ''m'' can be written as the kernel of some morphism. Specifically, ''m'' is the kernel of its own cokernel:
:&lt;math&gt;m = \ker(\operatorname{coker}(m))&lt;/math&gt;

==Intuition==
The cokernel can be thought of as the space of ''constraints'' that an equation must satisfy, as the space of ''obstructions,'' just as the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the space of ''solutions.''

Formally, one may connect the kernel and the cokernel of a map  ''T'':  ''V'' →  ''W'' by the [[exact sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \ker T \to V \overset T \longrightarrow W \to \operatorname{coker} T \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation {{math|1=''T''(''v'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''}} to solve,
* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation {{math|1=''T''(''v'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}}, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;
* the cokernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.

The dimension of the cokernel plus the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space, as the dimension of the quotient space {{tmath|W/T(V)}} is simply the dimension of the space ''minus'' the dimension of the image.

As a simple example, consider the map ''T'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, given by ''T''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''T''(''x'', ''y'') =(''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a = 0'' (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b''), or equivalently, {{math|1=(0, ''b'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''x'', 0)}}, (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) ⊆ ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution. The cokernel may be expressed via the real valued map ''W'': (''a'', ''b'') → (''a''): given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.

Additionally, the cokernel can be thought of as something that "detects" surjections in the same way that the kernel "detects" injections. A map is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial, and a map is surjective if and only if its cokernel is trivial, or in other words, if {{math|1=''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;im(''T'')}}.

'''Event processing''' is a method of tracking and [[data analytics|analyzing]] (processing) streams of information (data) about things that happen (events),&lt;ref name=LuckhamD&gt;{{cite book|last=Luckham|first=David C.|title=Event Processing for Business: Organizing the Real-Time Enterprise|url=http://ee.stanford.edu/~luckham/|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,|location = Hoboken, New Jersey|year=2012|page=3|isbn=978-0-470-53485-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deriving a conclusion from them. '''Complex event processing''', or '''CEP''', is event processing that combines data from multiple sources&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Schmerken|first=Ivy|title=Deciphering the Myths Around Complex Event Processing|url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-latency/207800335|publisher=Wall Street &amp; Technology|date=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to infer events or patterns that suggest more complicated circumstances. The goal of complex event processing is to identify meaningful events (such as [[business opportunity|opportunities]] or threats)&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{citation|last=Bates|first=John|title=John Bates of Progress explains how complex event processing works and how it can simplify the use of algorithms for finding and capturing trading opportunities|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/secrets-revealed-trading-tools-uncover-hidden-opportunities/|publisher=Fix Global Trading|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and respond to them as quickly as possible.

These events may be happening across the various layers of an organization as sales leads, orders or customer service calls. Or, they may be news items,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Crosman|first=Penny|title=Aleri, Ravenpack to Feed News into Trading Algos|url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/articles/217500395|publisher=Wall Street &amp; Technology|date=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; text messages, social media posts, stock market feeds, traffic reports, weather reports, or other kinds of data.&lt;ref name=LuckhamD /&gt; An event may also be defined as a "change of state," when a measurement exceeds a predefined threshold of time, temperature, or other value. Analysts suggest that CEP will give organizations a new way to analyze patterns in real-time and help the business side communicate better with IT and service departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McKay|first=Lauren|title=Forrester Gives a Welcoming Wave to Complex Event Processing|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/Daily-News/Forrester-Gives-a-Welcoming-Wave-to-Complex-Event-Processing-55492.aspx|publisher=Destination CRM|date=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast amount of information available about events is sometimes referred to as the event cloud.&lt;ref name=LuckhamD /&gt;

==Conceptual description==

Among thousands of incoming events, a monitoring system may for instance receive the following three from the same source:

# church bells ringing.
# the appearance of a man in a tuxedo with a woman in a flowing white gown.
# rice flying through the air.

From these events the monitoring system may infer a ''complex event'': a wedding. CEP as a technique helps discover complex events by analyzing and correlating other events:&lt;ref&gt;D. Luckham, "The Power of Events: An Introduction to Complex Event Processing in Distributed Enterprise Systems", Addison-Wesley, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the bells, the man and woman in wedding attire and the rice flying through the air.

CEP relies on a number of techniques,&lt;ref&gt;O. Etzion and P. Niblett, "Event Processing in Action", Manning Publications, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* Event-[[pattern detection]]
* Event [[abstraction]]
* Event filtering
* Event aggregation and transformation 
* Modeling event hierarchies
* Detecting relationships (such as [[causality]], [[meronymy|membership]] or [[Synchronization|timing]]) between events
* Abstracting [[event-driven programming|event-driven]] processes

Commercial applications of CEP exist in variety of industries and include [[Algorithmic trading|algorithmic stock-trading]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/secrets-revealed-trading-tools-uncover-hidden-opportunities/ Complex Event Processing for Trading], FIXGlobal, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the detection of [[credit card fraud|credit-card fraud]], [[business activity monitoring]], and security monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.complexevents.com Details of commercial products and use cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CEP area has roots in [[discrete event simulation]], the [[active database]] area and some programming languages. The activity in the industry was preceded by a wave of research projects in the 1990s. According to&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leavit|first=Neal|title=Complex-Event Processing Poised for Growth|url= http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2009/04/mco2009040017-abs.html|publisher=Computer, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 17-20 Washington|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first project that paved the way to a generic CEP language and execution model was the Rapide project in [[Stanford University]], directed by [[David Luckham]]. In parallel there have been two other research projects: Infospheres in [[California Institute of Technology]], directed by [[K. Mani Chandy]], and [[Apama (software)|Apama]] in [[University of Cambridge]] directed by John Bates. The commercial products were dependents of the concepts developed in these and some later research projects. Community efforts started  in a series of event processing symposiums organized by the [[Event Processing Technical Society]], and later by the ACM DEBS conference series. One of the community efforts was to produce the event processing manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2985|title=10201 Executive Summary and Manifesto – Event Processing|first1=Mani K.|last1=Chandy|first2=Opher|last2=Etzion|first3=Rainer von|last3=Ammon|editor-first1=K.

==Related concepts==

CEP is used in [[operational intelligence]] (OI) products to provide insight into business operations by running query analysis against live feeds and event data. OI collects real-time data and correlates against historical data to provide insight and analysis. Multiple sources of data can be combined to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. 

In [[network management]], [[systems management]], [[application management]] and [[service management]], people usually refer instead to [[event correlation]]. As CEP engines, event correlation engines (''event correlators'') analyze a mass of events, pinpoint the most significant ones, and trigger actions. However, most of them do not produce new inferred events. Instead, they relate high-level events with low-level events.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Martin-Flatin, G. Jakobson and L. Lewis, "Event Correlation in Integrated Management: Lessons Learned and Outlook", Journal of Network and Systems Management, Vol. 17, No. 4, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inference engine]]s, e.g., [[rule-based system|rule-based reasoning engine]]s, typically produce inferred information in [[artificial intelligence]]. However, they do not usually produce new information in the form of complex (i.e., inferred) events.

==Example==
A more systemic example of CEP involves a car, some sensors and various events and reactions. Imagine that a car has several sensors—one that measures tire pressure, one that measures speed, and one that detects if someone sits on a seat or leaves a seat.

In the first situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires moves from 45 [[pound per square inch|psi]] to 41 psi over 15 minutes. As the pressure in the tire is decreasing, a series of events containing the tire pressure is generated. In addition, a series of events containing the speed of the car is generated. The car's Event Processor may detect a situation whereby a loss of tire pressure over a relatively long period of time results in the creation of the "lossOfTirePressure" event. This new event may trigger a reaction process to note the pressure loss into the car's maintenance log, and alert the driver via the car's portal that the tire pressure has reduced.

In the second situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires drops from 45 psi to 20 psi in 5 seconds. A different situation is detected—perhaps because the loss of pressure occurred over a shorter period of time, or perhaps because the difference in values between each event were larger than a predefined limit. The different situation results in a new event "blowOutTire" being generated. This new event triggers a different reaction process to immediately alert the driver and to initiate onboard computer routines to assist the driver in bringing the car to a stop without losing control through skidding.

In addition, events that represent detected situations can also be combined with other events in order to detect more complex situations. For example, in the final situation the car is moving normally and suffers a blown tire which results in the car leaving the road and striking a tree, and the driver is thrown from the car. A series of different situations are rapidly detected. The combination of "blowOutTire", "zeroSpeed" and "driverLeftSeat" within a very short period of time results in a new situation being detected: "occupantThrownAccident". Even though there is no direct measurement that can determine conclusively that the driver was thrown, or that there was an accident, the combination of events allows the situation to be detected and a new event to be created to signify the detected situation. This is the essence of a complex (or composite) event. It is complex because one cannot directly detect the situation; one has to infer or deduce that the situation has occurred from a combination of other events.

==Integration with business process management==
A natural fit for CEP has been with [[business process management]] (BPM).&lt;ref&gt;C. Janiesch, M. Matzner and O. Müller: "A Blueprint for Event-Driven Business Activity Management", Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2011, Volume 6896/2011, 17-28, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-23059-2_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPM focuses on end-to-end business processes, in order to continuously optimize and align for its operational environment.

However, the optimization of a business does not rely solely upon its individual, end-to-end processes. Seemingly disparate processes can affect each other significantly. Consider this scenario:
In the aerospace industry, it is good practice to monitor breakdowns of vehicles to look for trends (determine potential weaknesses in manufacturing processes, material, etc.). Another separate process monitors current operational vehicles' life cycles and decommissions them when appropriate. One use for CEP is to link these separate processes, so that in the case of the initial process (breakdown monitoring) discovering a malfunction based on metal fatigue (a significant event), an action can be created to exploit the second process (life cycle) to issue a recall on vehicles using the same batch of metal discovered as faulty in the initial process.

The integration of CEP and BPM must exist at two levels, both at the business awareness level (users must understand the potential holistic benefits of their individual processes) and also at the technological level (there needs to be a method by which CEP can interact with BPM implementation). For a recent state of the art review on the integration of CEP with BPM, which is frequently labeled as Event-Driven Business Process Management, refer to.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krumeich, B. Weis, D. Werth and P. Loos: "Event-Driven Business Process Management: where are we now?: A comprehensive synthesis and analysis of literature", Business Process Management Journal, 2014, Volume 20, 615-633, {{doi|10.1108/BPMJ-07-2013-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-oriented CEP's role can arguably be seen to overlap with Business Rule technology.

For example, customer service centers are using CEP for click-stream analysis and customer experience management. CEP software can factor real-time information about millions of events (clicks or other interactions) per second into business intelligence and other decision-support applications. These "recommendation applications" help agents provide personalized service based on each customer's experience. The CEP application may collect data about what customers on the phone are currently doing, or how they have recently interacted with the company in other various channels, including in-branch, or on the Web via self-service features, instant messaging and email. The application then analyzes the total customer experience and recommends scripts or next steps that guide the agent on the phone, and hopefully keep the customer happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kobielus|first=James|title=Really Happy in Real Time|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Connect/Really-Happy-in-Real-Time-50530.aspx|publisher=Destination CRM|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In financial services==
The financial services industry was an early adopter of CEP technology, using complex event processing to structure and contextualize available data so that it could inform trading behavior, specifically [[algorithmic trading]], by identifying opportunities or threats that indicate traders (or automatic trading systems) should buy or sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Rise of Unstructured Data in Trading|url=http://aitegroup.com/report/rise-unstructured-data-trading|publisher=Aite Group|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a trader wants to track stocks that have five up movements followed by four down movements, CEP technology can track such an event. CEP technology can also track drastic rise and fall in number of trades. Algorithmic trading is already a practice in stock trading. It is estimated that around 60% of Equity trading in the United States is by way of algorithmic trades.  CEP is expected to continue to help financial institutions improve their algorithms and be more efficient.

Recent improvements in CEP technologies have made it more affordable, helping smaller firms to create trading algorithms of their own and compete with larger firms.&lt;ref name=Bates /&gt; CEP has evolved from an emerging technology to an essential platform of many capital markets. The technology's most consistent growth has been in banking, serving fraud detection, online banking, and multichannel marketing initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complex Event Processing: Beyond Capital Markets|url=http://www.aitegroup.com/Reports/ReportDetail.aspx?recordItemID=870|publisher=Aite Group|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a wide variety of financial applications use CEP, including profit, loss, and [[Financial risk management|risk management]] systems, [[Order book (trading)|order]] and [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] analysis, [[Quantitative investing|quantitative trading]] and signal generation systems, and others.

==Integration with time series databases==
A [[time series database]] is a software system that is optimized for the handling of data organized by time. Time series are finite or infinite sequences of data items, where each item has an associated timestamp and the sequence of timestamps is non-decreasing. Elements of a time series are often called ticks. The timestamps are not required to be ascending (merely non-decreasing) because in practice the time resolution of some systems such as financial data sources can be quite low (milliseconds, microseconds or even nanoseconds), so consecutive events may carry equal timestamps.

Time series data provides a historical context to the analysis typically associated with complex event processing. This can apply to any vertical industry such as finance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/papers/jagtalk.html|title=Time Series in Finance|website=cs.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperatively with other technologies such as BPM.

Consider the scenario in finance where there is a need to understand historic price volatility to determine statistical thresholds of future price movements. This is helpful for both trade models and transaction cost analysis.

The ideal case for CEP analysis is to view historical time series and real-time streaming data as a single time continuum. What happened yesterday, last week or last month is simply an extension of what is occurring today and what may occur in the future. An example may involve comparing current market volumes to historic volumes, prices and volatility for trade execution logic. Or the need to act upon live market prices may involve comparisons to benchmarks that include sector and index movements, whose intra-day and historic trends gauge volatility and smooth outliers.

==Internet of Things and Smart Cyber-physical systems==
Complex event processing is a key enabler in [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) settings and Smart [[Cyber-physical system]]s (CPS) as well. Processing dense and heterogeneous streams from various sensors and matching patterns against those streams is a typical task in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/istvan/pub/mtcps2016|title=Balogh, Dávid, Ráth, Varró, Vörös: Distributed and Heterogeneous Event-based Monitoring in Smart Cyber-Physical Systems, In 1st Workshop on Monitoring and Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems, Vienna, Austria. 2016.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these techniques rely on the fact that representing the IoT system's state and its changes is more efficient in the form of a data stream, instead of having a static, materialized model. Reasoning over such stream-based models fundamentally differs from traditional reasoning techniques and typically require the combination of [[model transformation]]s and CEP.&lt;ref&gt;I. Dávid, I. Ráth, D. Varró: Foundations for Streaming Model Transformations by Complex Event Processing, International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling, pp 1--28, 2016. {{doi|10.1007/s10270-016-0533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Director of Public Prosecutions v Santa-Bermudez''''' [2003&amp;#93; EWHC 2908 (Admin),&lt;ref name=b /&gt; also known as '''''DPP v Santana-Bermudez''''',&lt;ref name=l /&gt; is a 2003 decision of the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] of [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]], considering an appeal by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) in a criminal [[assault]] case.  

The defendant, Santa-Bermudez, had lied about the presence of sharp objects in his pocket when being searched by a female [[police constable]] and the constable was injured. The defendant was charged with [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] but he argued that as he had not actively committed any action that led to the injury, he lacked the required ''[[actus reus]]'' for the crime to have been committed. 

Although convicted at the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], the defendant appealed to the [[Crown Court]] which found in his favour and dismissed the case.  The DPP appealed to the High Court, which ruled that the defendant's willful [[omissions in English criminal law|omission]], which put the constable in a dangerous situation, was sufficient ''actus reus'' for the crime to have been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digestiblenotes.com/law/criminal_cases/omissions.php |title=Omissions Cases |publisher=Digestible Notes |date= |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In June 2001, PC Hill was called to [[Stockwell tube station]] where she was investigating [[ticket tout]]s. She found the defendant and [[stop and search|searched him]] under section 1 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. When asked if he had any sharp items on him, the defendant answered in the negative. Upon searching him, PC Hill was pricked by [[hypodermic needle]]s hidden in his pockets. The defendant was arrested and was later discovered to have [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]], though PC Hill was not infected.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

== Crown Court ==
The defendant was charged with [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) and was found guilty at [[Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court]]. He appealed this conviction to [[Middlesex Guildhall|Middlesex Crown Court]], which heard the appeal in December 2001. Following the prosecution's evidence being given, the defendant's counsel submitted that the defendant had committed no positive act that resulted in ABH, that an omission did not amount to assault, and on that basis there was [[no case to answer]]. The panel agreed, allowing the appeal, and quashed the conviction.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

The DPP appealed this decision to the High Court to determine whether an omission did constitute sufficient ''actus reus'' for the crime to be committed.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

== High Court ==
The DPP's appeal was heard by [[Maurice Kay|Mr Justice Maurice Kay]] and [[Colin Mackay (judge)|Mr Justice Mackay]], sitting as the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division.  The DPP was represented by [[Rachel Lawrence]] (daughter of former MP Sir [[Ivan Lawrence]]), instructed by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS); she was the same prosecution barrister as had appeared in the Crown Court.  The CPS indicated that they would not seek for the case to be remitted to the Crown Court for a retrial; having already been acquitted, the defendant did not appear and was not represented in the High Court.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

The judges considered the DPP's submission that ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' and ''R v Roberts'' showed that willful omission could be sufficient ''actus reus''.&lt;ref name=b /&gt; The court also considered the case of ''[[R v Miller]]'' where it was held that [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]] failing to take action when the defendant created a dangerous situation was enough for ''actus reus''. 

Mr Justice Maurice Kay, giving the only reasoned judgment, commented that "A great deal of undesirable complexity has bedevilled our criminal law as a result of quasi theological distinctions between acts and omissions".  He held that, as the defendant had recklessly given a false statement to PC Hill that put her in a dangerous situation with a foreseeable risk of harm through the omission, the Crown Court was incorrect to allow the motion to dismiss and allowed the appeal.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2003/november/director-of-public-prosecutions-v-santana-bermudez |title=Director of Public Prosecutions v Santana-Bermudez |publisher=LexisWeb |date=13 November 2003 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Justice Mackay agreed with the ''[[ratio decidendi]]''.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/2908.html&amp;query=Bermudez&amp;method=all#disp0 |title=Director of Public Prosecutions v Santa-Bermudez [2003&amp;#93; EWHC 2908 (Admin) (13 November 2003) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The legal principle that an assault can be committed by an omission that was affirmed in this case, was later put into [[statute law]] through the passage of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Nicola | last =Monaghan | title =Criminal Law Directions  | publisher = Oxford University Press | volume =   | year = 2014 | isbn = 0198702280 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sverigekarta-Landskap_Småland.svg|thumb|150px|A map of Småland.]]
The '''Dacke War''' ({{lang-sv|Dackefejden}}) was a [[peasant uprising]] led by [[Nils Dacke]] in [[Småland]], [[Sweden]], in 1542 against the rule of [[Gustav Vasa]]. Dacke and his followers were dissatisfied with the heavy tax burden, the introduction of [[Lutheranism]] and the confiscation of Church property (the confiscation and taxes were introduced to pay for the [[Swedish War of Liberation]] that had brought Gustav Vasa to power). In 1543 the uprising was defeated, and Nils Dacke was killed.

[[Image:Gustav Vasa triumphs 4.jpg|thumb|400px|The army of [[Gustav Vasa]] on its way to defeat [[Nils Dacke]].]]

== Background ==
{{See also|Early Vasa era}}

[[Nils Dacke]] and his peasants were dissatisfied with the policies of the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]]. In his effort to modernize Sweden and gain more power, the king had instituted a more efficient system for [[tax]] collection. The heavy tax burden angered many peasants.

Gustav Vasa had also broken relations with [[Rome]] and promoted [[Lutheranism]] instead of [[Catholicism]] in order to confiscate the property of the church (including land), effected by the laws of the [[Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden]]. In 1541 the king's men had confiscated many of the belongings of the churches in [[Småland]], such as the church silver and even the [[church bell]]s, to finance the army. Dacke criticized the new church order and promoted the old faith. He was also supported by many local [[priest]]s.

The rebellion was one of many rebellions during the rule of Gustav Vasa. In contrast with other contemporary rebellions in Sweden, this one was led by peasants, and not supported by the local [[nobility]].

== The uprising ==
The uprising began in the summer of 1542 when the king's [[bailiff]]s were attacked and killed when they came to collect taxes. Gustav Vasa responded by sending a military force led by his own father-in-law [[:sv:Gustaf Olofsson till Torpa|Gustav Olofsson Stenbock the Younger]]. He was defeated by Dacke's constantly growing army of peasants. Other attempts to defeat Dacke militarily also failed.

Next, the Swedish government stopped all supplies of provisions and other necessities to the region. This weakened the rebellions considerably. Defaming propaganda about Dacke was also spread by the government, labeling him a traitor and a heretic.

In March 1543 Gustav Vasa ordered his army of Swedish recruits and German [[landsknecht]] mercenaries to attack Småland. This time larger forces were deployed, and Dacke's forces were attacked from two directions - from [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. The uprising was defeated, and Dacke was wounded but managed to flee.

== Aftermath ==
The king's revenge on the instigators of the rebellion was hard. The leaders that were caught were executed together with the priests who had supported Dacke. Peasants who had supported the rebellion were deported to [[Finland]], where they had to serve in the army, and the counties where the rebellion had taken place had to pay a large fine to the king.

Dacke himself was caught and killed in August 1543 when trying to escape the country. According to legend, his body was taken to [[Kalmar]], where his head was publicly displayed wearing a crown of copper, as a warning to others.

The rebellion was the most serious threat to the rule of Gustav Vasa, but after having defeated it he managed to consolidate his power, concentrating more and more power in the hands of the monarch.

== Idiom ==
In the Swedish language, the [[idiom]] &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;"[something]&lt;/span&gt; hasn't happened since the Dacke War" is used to mean "[something] hasn't happened for a long time". This expression is especially common in the southern parts of Sweden but is also used elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2201">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''decathexis''' is the withdrawal of [[cathexis]] from an idea or [[Instinct#In psychology|instinctual]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/decathexis-reference/decathexis Paul Denis, 'Decathexis']&lt;/ref&gt;

Decathexis is the process of dis-investment of mental or emotional energy in a person, object, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Calvin S. ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology''. New York: Mentor, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==

In [[narcissistic neurosis]], cathexis is withdrawn from external instinctual objects (or rather their unconscious representations)&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and turned on the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] - a process Freud highlighted in the [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] case, and linked to the subject's ensuing [[megalomania]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 208-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar decathexis of energy has been linked to the emergence of symptoms of [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 266-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] saw decathexis as the product of the [[death drive]], blanking out the possibility of thinking by a process of what he called de-objectilizing.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grief==
Decathexis of the lost person in grief was seen as a regular part of the mourning process by Freud, although later analysts have argued that such decathexis was rather the result of inhibited or partial mourning, not of successful mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Lora H. Tessman, ''The Analyst's Analyst Within'' (2003) p. 236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi.

'''Ethics''' or '''moral philosophy''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [[action (philosophy)|conduct]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of ethics, along with [[aesthetics]], concern matters of [[Value (ethics)|value]], and thus comprise the branch of [[philosophy]] called [[axiology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human [[morality]] by defining concepts such as [[good and evil]], right and [[wrong]], [[virtue]] and [[vice]], [[justice]] and [[crime]]. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral [[philosophy]] also is related to the fields of [[moral psychology]], [[descriptive ethics]], and [[value theory]].

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their [[truth value]]s (if any) can be determined
# [[Normative ethics]], concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
# [[Applied ethics]], concerning what a person is [[obligated]] (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

==Defining ethics==
The English word "ethics" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''ēthikós'' ({{lang|el|ἠθικός}}), meaning "relating to one's character", which itself comes from the root word ''êthos'' ({{lang|el|ἦθος}}) meaning "character, moral nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''ethica'' and then into French as ''éthique'', from which it was borrowed into English.

[[Rushworth Kidder]] states that "standard definitions of ''ethics'' have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living|last=Kidder|first= Rushworth|year=2003|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York|ISBN=0-688-17590-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard William Paul and [[Linda Elder]] define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|ISBN=0-944583-17-2|page=NP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|isbn=0-944583-17-2|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ethics'' in English refers to several things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 4, 2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic|title=Definition of ethic by Merriam Webster|publisher= Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can refer to [[philosophical]] ethics or moral philosophy—a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions. As the English philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: "What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, "how one should live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about [[ethical]] problems that is not particular to philosophy. As [[bioethicist]] Larry Churchill has written: "Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are We Professionals? A Critical Look at the Social Role of Bioethicists.
|journal=Daedalus|year=1999|pages=253–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also be used to describe a particular person's own [[idiosyncratic]] principles or habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |url=http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |title=Buddha and Socrates share Common ground |author=David Tanguay |publisher=Soul of Wit |archivedate=July 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722174808/http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: "Joe has strange ethics."

==Meta-ethics==
{{Main|Meta-ethics}}
Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |title=What is ethics? |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical question pertaining to a particular practical situation—such as, "Should I eat this particular piece of chocolate cake?"—cannot be a meta-ethical question (rather, this is an applied ethical question). A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, "Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?" is a meta-ethical question.

Meta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].

Studies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.

The [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative ethics==
{{Main|Normative ethics}}
[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.

At the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].

===Virtue ethics===
{{main|Virtue ethics}}
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]
[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469–399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

[[Aristotle]] (384–323&amp;nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed "virtuous". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.

Aristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.

====Stoicism====
{{main|Stoicism}}
[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]
The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not "lose" their life, but instead "return", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|38–41}}

====Contemporary virtue ethics====
Modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to "universal standards", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S. S.

In ''Whose Justice, Whose Rationality?'', MacIntyre's ambition of taking a rational path beyond relativism was quite clear when he stated "rival claims made by different traditions […] are to be evaluated […] without relativism" (p.&amp;nbsp;354) because indeed "rational debate between and rational choice among rival traditions is possible” (p.&amp;nbsp;352).

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Cyrenaic hedonism====
Founded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Epicureanism====
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
Epicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] "...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

===State consequentialism===
{{Main|State consequentialism}}
[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.&lt;ref name=readings/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as "a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are&amp;nbsp;... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]|year=1999|last=Loewe|first=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-47030-8|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Mozi]]'s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|year=2011|last=Van Norden|first=Bryan W. |publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-60384-468-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth&amp;nbsp;... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically."&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; The Mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven". In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&amp;pg=PA62|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=62|quote=The goods that serve as criteria of morality are collective or public, in contrast, for instance, to individual happiness or well-being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism/teleology===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Ethical egoism}}
Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action (or create a structure for judgment, see [[#Rule consequentialism|rule consequentialism]]). Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''"The ends justify the means"''.

The term "consequentialism" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M. Anscombe|title= Modern Moral Philosophy|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=33|pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958|author=Anscombe, G. E. M.|publisher=1958|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.

The defining feature of consequentialist moral theories is the weight given to the consequences in evaluating the rightness and wrongness of actions.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|authorlink=J._L._Mackie|origyear=1977|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-013558-8|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequentialist theories, the consequences of an action or rule generally outweigh other considerations. Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:
* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?
* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?
* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?

One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as "happiness", "welfare", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S. Fosl|year=2007|publisher= Blackwell|location=Malden|isbn=978-1-4051-3230-5|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] are influential proponents of this school of thought.  In ''A Fragment on Government'' Bentham says 'it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong' and describes this as a fundamental [[axiom]]. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' he talks of 'the principle of utility' but later prefers "the greatest happiness principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentham |first= Jeremy|title=The Works of Jeremy Bentham: Published under the Superintendence of His Executor, John Bowring. Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|page=18|isbn= 978-1-4021-6393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Stuart Mill"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm#CHAPTER_I Mill, John Stuart, Utilitarianism (Project Gutenberg online edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book|title= Utilitarianism|year=1998|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2|url= http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy proponents of utilitarianism are neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], author of, amongst other works, ''[[Practical Ethics]]''.

The major division within utilitarianism is between ''[[act utilitarianism]]'' and ''[[rule utilitarianism]]''. In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon University"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed "middle ground" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.

===Deontology===
&lt;!-- Section linked from "Categorical imperative" --&gt;
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

Deontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέον}}, ''deon'', "obligation, duty"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself. Under deontology, an act may be considered right even if the act produces a bad consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert G. 1967. 'Deontological Ethics'. In Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: [[Collier Macmillan]]: 343.&lt;/ref&gt; if it follows the ''rule'' or moral law.  According to the deontological view, people have a ''duty'' to act in a way that does those things that are inherently good as acts ("truth-telling" for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in [[rule utilitarianism]]).

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. [[Greenwood Press]]: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''deon'').&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1780. 'Preface'. In ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives (expressed as maxims) of the person who carries out the action. Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. 'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is 'good in itself' when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and 'good without qualification' when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], perseverance and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic ethics===
{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}
Associated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, if social reform is provided for).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last= Lafollette|series=Blackwell Philosophy Guides|edition=1|url=http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/pragmati.htm |date=February 2000|title=The Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory|isbn=978-0-631-20119-9 | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics of care===
{{Main|Ethics of care}}
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as consequentialist theories (e.g. utilitarianism) and deontological theories (e.g., Kantian ethics) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values that—proponents of care ethics contend—are absent in such traditional models of ethics. These values include the importance of empathetic relationships and compassion.

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially assigned to women, and consequently devalued. They write, “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength,” that should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role ethics===

Role ethics is an ethical theory based on [[family]] roles.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Roger T. Ames |author=Roger T.

Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." Morality is determined through a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

===Anarchist ethics===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] ethics is an ethical theory based on the studies of anarchist thinkers. The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Starting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis – in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially – and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.

Kropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of "sociality" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf "Ethics: Origin and Development" by Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html "Anarchist morality", chapter VI, Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Postmodern ethics===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}
The 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.

[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, at least in part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that "there is no outside-text/non-text" ("''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''" is often mistranslated as "there is nothing outside the text"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.

Post-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.

David Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the "ethical turn" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the "obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;103).

Hoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as "not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless"(2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Hoy concludes that
{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}

==Applied ethics==
{{Main|Applied ethics}}
Applied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].

===Specific questions===
Applied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: "Is getting an abortion immoral?" "Is euthanasia immoral?" "Is affirmative action right or wrong?" "What are human rights, and how do we determine them?" "Do animals have rights as well?" and "Do individuals have the right of self-determination?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

A more specific question could be: "If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration—in fact, no common assumptions of all participants—so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, "Is lying always wrong?" and, "If not, when is it permissible?" is prior to any etiquette.

People, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a "yes or no", "right or wrong" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.

===Particular fields of application===
====Bioethics====
{{Main|Bioethics}}
{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}
Bioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|"the ethics of the ordinary"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.

Bioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. "three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

For example, [[biotic ethics]] value organic gene/protein life itself and seek to propagate it.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title=Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space|journal=[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]|volume=23|issue=8|pages=433–440|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x|pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such life-centered principles, ethics may secure a cosmological future for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title= Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future|publisher=[[Legacy Books]] (www.amazon.com)|location=Washington D.

====Business ethics====
{{Main|Business ethics}}
Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment, including fields like [[medical ethics]]. Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, A. A., &amp; Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, "Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'—as there once was a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&amp;nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&amp;nbsp;... They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners&amp;nbsp;... but all society." p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=C. |first2=M. |last2=Parker |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CSKX2HdnikC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=For Business Ethics: A Critical Text |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-31135-7 |display-authors=etal |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=ferrell|first=o.c|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9781305500846|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Machine ethics====
{{Main|Machine ethics}}
In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in [[machine ethics]] will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.&lt;ref name=Wallach2008&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wendell |last1=Wallach|first2=Colin|last2=Allen|date=November 2008|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=USA|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense. For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]], and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.

====Military ethics====
{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}

Military ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics. However individual countries and traditions have different fields of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emmanuel|last=Goffi|authorlink=Emmanuel Goffi|year=2011|title=Les Armée Françaises Face à la Morale|trans-title=The French Army Facing Morale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpyjGdEsCA4C|language=fr|location=France|publisher=L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2296542495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military ethics involves multiple subareas, including the following among others:
# what, if any, should be the laws of war.
# justification for the initiation of military force.
# decisions about who may be targeted in warfare.
# decisions on choice of weaponry, and what collateral effects such weaponry may have.
# standards for handling military prisoners.
# methods of dealing with violations of the laws of war.

====Political ethics====
{{main|Political ethics}}
Political ethics (also known as political morality or public ethics) is the practice of making moral judgements about political action and political agents.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. "Political Ethics". ''International Encyclopedia of Ethics'', ed. Hugh LaFollette (Blackwell Publishing, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public sector ethics====
{{main|Public sector ethics}}
Public sector ethics is a set of principles that guide public officials in their service to their constituents, including their decision-making on behalf of their constituents.  Fundamental to the concept of public sector ethics is the notion that decisions and actions are based on what best serves the public's interests, as opposed to the official's personal interests (including financial interests) or self-serving political interests.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, work of Institute for Local Government, at [http://www.ca-ilg.org/trust www.ca-ilg.org/trust].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication ethics====
Publication ethics is the set of principles that guide the writing and publishing process for all professional publications. To follow these principles, authors must verify that the publication does not contain [[plagiarism]] or [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Neil|title=Publication ethics|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|date=October 2009|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1011–1013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x/full|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way to avoid misconduct in research these principles can also apply to experiments that are referenced or analyzed in publications by ensuring the data is recorded honestly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=E|last2=Fiack|first2=S|last3=Graf|first3=C|last4=Robinson|first4=A|last5=Rowlands|first5=I|title=Science journal editors' views on publication ethics: results of an international survey|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=31 March 2009|volume=35|issue=6|pages=348–353|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/35/6/348.short|doi=10.1136/jme.2008.028324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the failure to give credit to another author’s work or ideas, when it is used in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scollon|first1=Ron|title=Plagiarism|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=9|pages=188–190|jstor=43102462|doi=10.1525/jlin.1999.9.1-2.188|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the obligation of the editor of the journal to ensure the article does not contain any plagiarism before it is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Williams|first2=Peter|title=Why and how do journals retract articles? An analysis of Medline retractions 1988—2008|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=September 2011|volume=37|issue=9|pages=567–570|jstor=23034717|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.040964}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a publication that has already been published is proven to contain plagiarism, the editor of the journal can retract the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanjeev|first1=Handa|title=Plagiarism and publication ethics: Dos and don'ts|journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=4|pages=301–303|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=4;spage=301;epage=303;aulast=Handa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication bias occurs when the publication is one-sided or "[[prejudiced]] against results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigelman|first1=Lee|title=Publication Bias Reconsidered|journal=Political Analysis|date=2000|volume=8|issue=2|pages=201–210|jstor=25791607|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a029813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In best practice, an author should try to include information from all parties involved, or affected by the topic. If an author is prejudiced against certain results, than it can "lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Jamie L.|last2=Sutton|first2=Alex J.|last3=Jones|first3=David R.|last4=Abrams|first4=Keith R.|last5=Rushton|first5=Lesley|last6=Moreno|first6=Santiago G.|title=Assessing publication bias in meta-analysis in the presence of between-study heterogeneity|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|date=July 2010|volume=173|issue=3|pages=575–591|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00629.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct in research can occur when an experimenter falsifies results.&lt;ref name="j25175246"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Misconduct in Research: Editors Respond: The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Is Formed|journal=British Medical Journal|date=July 26, 1997|volume=315|issue=7102|pages=201–202|jstor=25175246|doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7102.201|pmc=2127155|pmid=9253258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falsely recorded information occurs when the researcher "fakes" information or data, which was not used when conducting the actual experiment.&lt;ref name="j25175246"/&gt; By faking the data, the researcher can alter the results from the experiment to better fit the hypothesis they originally predicted. When conducting medical research, it is important to honor the healthcare rights of a patient by protecting their [[anonymity]] in the publication.&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"/&gt;
''Respect for autonomy'' is the principle that decision-making should allow individuals to be autonomous; they should be able to make decisions that apply to their own lives. This means that individuals should have control of their lives.
''Justice'' is the principle that decision-makers must focus on actions that are fair to those affected. Ethical decisions need to be consistent with the ethical theory. There are cases where the management has made decisions that seem to be unfair to the employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders (Solomon, 1992, pp49). Such decisions are unethical.

====Relational ethics====
Relational ethics are related to an [[ethics of care]].&lt;ref name="GILLIGAN2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Gilligan|title=In a Different Voice|date=June 30, 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}} They are used in qualitative research, especially ethnography and autoethnography. Researchers who employ relational ethics value and respect the connection between themselves and the people they study, and "...between researchers and the communities in which they live and work." (Ellis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Telling secrets, revealing lives: Relational ethics in research with intimate others | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 3–29 | doi=10.1177/1077800406294947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics also help researchers understand difficult issues such as conducting research on intimate others that have died and developing friendships with their participants.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1986). ''Fisher folk. Two communities on Chesapeake Bay.'' Lexington: [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995).''Final negotiations: A story of love, loss, and chronic illness.'' Philadelphia: [[Temple University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics in close personal relationships form a central concept of [[Ivan Böszörményi-Nagy#Contextual therapy|contextual therapy]].

====Animal ethics====
{{Main|Animal ethics}}
Animal ethics is a term used in academia to describe human-animal relationships and how animals ought to be treated. The subject matter includes [[animal rights]], [[animal welfare]], [[animal law]], [[speciesism]], [[animal cognition]], [[wildlife conservation]], the moral status of nonhuman animals, the concept of nonhuman [[personhood]], [[Anthropocentrism|human exceptionalism]], the history of animal use, and theories of [[justice]].

==Moral psychology==
{{Main|Moral psychology}}
'''Moral psychology''' is a field of study that began as an issue in [[philosophy]] and that is now properly considered part of the discipline of [[psychology]].  Some use the term "moral psychology" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of [[moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and "moral psychology" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and [[philosophy of mind]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Doris &amp; Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: "Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions" (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], moral development, [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary ethics===
{{Main|Evolutionary ethics}}
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |title=Evolutionary Ethics |author=Doris Schroeder |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007081051/http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |archivedate=October 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive ethics==
{{Main|Descriptive ethics}}
Descriptive ethics is on the less philosophical end of the spectrum since it seeks to gather particular information about how people live and draw general conclusions based on observed patterns. Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical—such as, "Is ethical knowledge possible?"—are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating "bottom up" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:
* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics—and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.
* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] ("Miss Manners"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.
* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing "right versus right", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.
* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, [[political science]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hary Gunarto]], Ethical Issues in Cyberspace and IT Society, Symposium on Whither The Age of Uncertainty, APU Univ., [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440840_Ethical_Issues_in_Cyberspace_and_IT_Society paper],  Jan. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">The '''flail space model (FSM)''' is a [[Physical model|model]] of how a [[passenger|car passenger]] moves in a [[vehicle]] that collides with a roadside feature such as a [[Traffic barrier|guardrail]] or a [[crash cushion]]. Its principal purpose is to assess the potential risk of harm to the hypothetical occupant as he or she impacts the interior of the passenger compartment and, ultimately, the efficacy of an experimental roadside feature undergoing full-scale vehicle crash testing.

The FSM eliminates the complexity and expense of using instrumented [[Crash test dummy|anthropometric dummies]] during the crash test experiments. Furthermore, while crash test dummies were developed to model collisions between vehicles, they are not accurate when used for the sorts of collision angles that occur when a vehicle collides with a roadside feature; by contrast, the FSM was designed for such collisions.&lt;ref name="gabauer"&gt;Gabauer, Douglas, "A methodology to evaluate the flail space model using event data recorder technology", Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The FSM is based on research performed at [[Southwest Research Institute]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D., "Development of improved criteria for evaluating safety performance of highway appurtenances", Final Report of  Internal Research Project No. 03-9254, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, June 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1981 in the paper entitled "Collision Risk Assessment Based on Occupant Flail-Space Model" by Jarvis D. Michie.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michie, J. D., "Collision risk assessment based on occupant flail space model," in Transportation Research Record 796, 1981, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSM (coined by Michie) was accepted by the highway community and published as a key part of the "Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances" published in 1981 in [[National Cooperative Highway Research Program]] (NCHRP) Report 230.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 230: Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, March 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the NCHRP Report was updated and presented as NCHRP Report 350;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. E., Jr. et al.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 350:  Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Features.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in this research effort performed by the [[Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute|Texas Transportation Research Institute]], the FSM was reexamined and was unmodified in the new publication. In 2004, Douglas Gabauer further examined the efficacy of the FSM in his [[PhD thesis]].&lt;ref name="gabauer" /&gt; The [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) retained the FSM as the method of assessing the risk of harm to vehicle occupants in the 2009 "Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware" that replaced NCHRP Report 350, stating that the FSM had "served its intended purpose well".&lt;ref&gt;Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware.  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Washington, DC,  2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The FSM hypothesis divides the collision into two stages.  In stage one, the unrestrained occupant is propelled forward and sideways in the compartment space due to vehicle collision [[Acceleration|accelerations]] and then impacts one or more surfaces (including the steering wheel) with velocity "V". According to the model, the vehicle (instead of the occupant) is the object that is accelerating. The occupant experiences no injury-producing force prior to contact with the compartment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In stage two, the occupant is assumed to remain in contact with the compartment surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of the collision.  The occupant may sustain [[Blunt trauma|injury]] at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two.  The occupant impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry.  Finally, the hypothetical occupant impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of [[Engineering tolerance|human tolerance]] to these forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Fridericus Spee SJ.jpg|thumb|Contemporary portrait]]
'''Friedrich Spee''' (also ''Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld''; February 25, 1591 – August 7, 1635) was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8139-2182-1}}. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1GMTaUuzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi)] contains many details on Spee's life.&lt;/ref&gt;

His name is often incorrectly cited as "Friedrich von Spee".&lt;ref name="franz2001"&gt;''Friedrich Spee zum 400 Geburtstag. Kolloquium der Friedrich-Spee-Gesellschaft Trier'' (in German). Paderborn: Gunther Franz, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Paderborn - 2016-09-14 - Friedrich Spee (2).jpg|thumb|Statue in Paderborn]]
Spee was born at [[Kaiserswerth]] on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]]. On finishing his early education at [[Cologne]], he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher&lt;ref name="Hellyer"/&gt; at [[Trier]], [[Fulda]], [[Würzburg]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], where he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1622. He became [[professor]] at the [[University of Paderborn]] in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, [[Wesel]], Trier and Cologne, and preached at [[Paderborn]], Cologne and [[Hildesheim]].

An attempt to assassinate Spee was made at [[Peine]] in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the [[Thirty Years' War]]), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

==Publications==
[[File:Trutz nachtigal 1654.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Trutz-Nachtigal'']]
Spee's literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: ''Goldenes Tugendbuch'' (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and ''Trutznachtigall'' (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present.

His principal work, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' (Precautions for Prosecutors), is a layout for the prosecution of witchcraft, based on his own experiences in [[Westphalia]]. It is thought that he acted for a long time as "witch confessor" in Würzburg, as he seemed to have knowledge of what could be considered the private thoughts of the condemned. The book was printed in Latin in 1631 at [[Rinteln]] without Spee's name or permission. He did not advocate the immediate abolition of trials for witchcraft, but described with [[sarcasm]] the abuses in the prevailing legal proceedings, particularly the use of the [[rack (torture)|rack]]. He demanded measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. If these had been carried out, they would have quickly put an end to the mass persecution of suspected witches.

Nevertheless, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' did bring about the abolition of witch-burning in a number of places, especially at [[Mainz]], and led the way to its gradual suppression. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Even in the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations appeared. Among the members of Spee's Jesuit order, his treatise found a favourable reception. A memorable observation in the book suggested that Germany and England must have more witches and devils than Spain and Italy, since there were so many more stake burnings in the former. This may have been a not so subtle criticism of Protestant reform Europe, which he believed was guilty of even greater abuses than the Catholic countries. His book is still in print.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

===Arguments against torture===
[[File:Cautio criminalis 1631.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Cautio Criminalis'', attributed to "unknown Roman theologian"]]
''Cautio Criminalis'' contains 52 questions which Spee argued and attempted to answer.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Amongst his more notable conclusions were:

* (17) That alleged witches should be provided a [[lawyer]] and a [[legal defense]], the enormity of the crime making this right even more important than normal.
* (20) That there is a real risk that innocents will confess under torture simply to stop the pain.
* (25) That condemning alleged witches for ''not'' confessing under torture is absurd. Spee opposed the notion that such silence was itself evidence of sorcery, as this made everyone guilty.
* (27) That torture does not produce truth, since those who wish to stop their own suffering can stop it with either the truth or with lies.
* (44) That denunciations of accomplices by tortured "witches" were of little value: either the tortured person was innocent, in which case she had no accomplices, or she was really in league with the [[Devil]], in which case her denunciations could not be trusted either.

Spee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion:

:''Many people who incite the [[Inquisition]] so vehemently against sorcerers in their towns and villages are not at all aware and do not notice or foresee that once they have begun to clamor for torture, every person tortured must denounce several more. The trials will continue, so eventually the denunciations will inevitably reach them and their families, since, as I warned above, no end will be found until everyone has been burned.'' (question 15)&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

Spee did not dispute the existence of witches, and opened his work with a declaration that witches are real. However, he was most troubled that innocent people were being tortured and killed alongside real witches, as he strongly believed. He argued (question 13) that the [[Parable of the Weeds]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:24-30 meant that some of the guilty must be allowed freedom, so that the innocent are not condemned either.

===Hymn writer===
[[File:Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld Briefmarke zum 400. Geburtstag.JPG|thumb|German postage stamp honoring Spee's 400th birthday (1991)]]
Spee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the [[Advent song]] "[[O Heiland, reiß die Himmel auf]]", the [[Christmas carol]]s "[[Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt]]" and "{{lang|de|[[Zu Bethlehem geboren]]|italic=no}}", and the Easter hymn "[[Lasst uns erfreuen]]" widely used with the 20th-century English texts "[[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]]" and "[[All Creatures of Our God and King]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8874">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|Visual representation of the Pythagorean theorem. Under the proposal the shape seen here would be drawn at vast size on the Siberian tundra using pine trees and fields of wheat.]]
'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==

Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

'''Gender violence''', also known as '''gender-based violence''' or '''gendered violence''', is the term used to denote harm inflicted upon individuals and groups that is connected to normative understandings of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/755629989|title=Violence against women and girls : a compendium of monitoring and evaluation indicators|last=S.|first=Bloom, Shelah|date=2008|publisher=MEASURE Evaluation, Carolina Population Center|oclc=755629989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection can be in the form of cultural understandings of gender roles, institutional and structural forces that endorse violence based on gender and societal influences that shape violent events along gender lines.  While the term is often used synonymously with ‘violence against women’, gendered violence can and does occur for people of all genders including men, women, male and female children and gender diverse individuals.  

Activities heavily associated with violence are overwhelmingly shaped by understandings of gender and gender roles. War, for example, in contemporary understandings is divided between civilian and combatants with a general understanding that men make up the vast majority of combatants and women and young children the majority of civilians. In cases like the Srebenica massacre, in which 8,000 men and male children were killed, the basis of their murder was a gendered understanding that they had the potential of being, or becoming combatants in the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-11|title=Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia2014 086  Edited by Alexander Mikaberidze   Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia  Santa Barbara, CA ABC-Clio 2013 9781598849264 Contact publisher for pricing information|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=18–18|doi=10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|issn=0950-4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing gender and violence at regional levels, the experiences of people who exist in transition between spaces or who are not counted within regional data can potentially be omitted from this discussion; these include displaced persons, people seeking asylum and refugees.

== Asia ==
Violence against women is a major concern in the Asian regions, especially the prevalence of marital violence varies considerably across South Asian countries. For married women aged 15–49 years, physical or sexual violence within marriage has been experienced by 20% in the Maldives, 26% in Pakistan, 28% in Nepal, 38% in India and 53% in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jejeebhoy|first=Shireen J.|last2=Santhya|first2=K.G.|last3=Acharya|first3=Rajib|date=2014-05-19|title=Violence against women in South Asia: The need for the active engagement of the health sector|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|journal=Global Public Health|volume=9|issue=6|pages=678–690|doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|issn=1744-1692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence against women is a very serious issue that can be attributed to the death. For example, India recorded over 40.000 dowry-related deaths between 2011 and 2015. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the Asia Foundation points out that gender-based violence is the first or second cause of international homicides in these countries. One of the biggest historical violence against women is the phenomenon of comfort women.

== Middle East ==
Gendered violence in the Middle East greatly targeted towards women and is justified by political and religious laws; acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Islamic law is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor. In Yemen, for example, 400 women were subjected to honor killings between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadiqi|first=Fatima|date=2014-01-02|title=Gender and Violence in Islamic Societies: Patriarchy, Islamism and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=1|pages=185–187|doi=10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|issn=1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which women are held to a code of honor include the practice of wearing scarves and refraining from using makeup, failure to do so can potentially result in physical and verbal harassment or loss of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2011-04-22|title=Gender and Violence in the Middle East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203830727|doi=10.4324/9780203830727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars Islamic laws make it justifiable to rape, beat, and sell non-Muslim women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Ali|first=Nadje|date=2016-03|title=Sexual violence in Iraq: Challenges for transnational feminist politics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350506816633723|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=25|issue=1|pages=10–27|doi=10.1177/1350506816633723|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly patriarchal mindset that takes place in both religious and political laws makes it difficult for women to seek an alternative option.

== Oceania ==
To understand the connection between Gender and Violence in the Oceanic context it is crucial to understand the effects of colonisation on Aotearoa (New Zealand), the Pacific islands and the many nations within the Australian continent. While practices of colonisation in these regions have not been homogenous, colonisation has disrupted gender roles, relationships and modes of production, which continue to influence both contemporary gender relations and practices of violence and domination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Atkinson, Judy. "Violence in Aboriginal Australia: Colonisation and Gender." ''Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal'' 14, no. 2 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  As Atkinson discusses, in Australia ongoing colonial relationships of power continue to create and perpetuate gendered violence, particularly for Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, for Aotearoa/New Zealand the introduction of colonial patriarchy and racialised colonial power has fundamentally altered Māori frameworks and relationships to the land which have transformed both Māori ways of being and interpersonal relationships such as connections between genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cavino, Hayley Marama. "Intergenerational Sexual Violence and Wh ā nau in Aotearoa/ New Zealand - Pedagogies of Contextualisation and Transformation." ''Sexual Abuse in Australia and New Zealand'' 7, no. 1 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have these changed relationships resulted in sexual gender based violence but also a broader adoption of masculine settler norms that foster violence and gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Jane, and James Ritchie. ''Violence in New Zealand.'' Huia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these colonial legacies there is a strong focus on supporting peace and deconstructing gendered relations. For example, in the Pacific, the Women, Peace and Security agenda has a large role in preventing violence in Pacific communities as women within in this region play strong roles in advocating for peace and working to prevent violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Nicole|date=2014-04-29|title=Promoting Women, Peace and Security in the Pacific Islands: hot conflict/slow violence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|volume=68|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|issn=1035-7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South America ==
A major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gangs affiliation and membership.

'''Geothermobarometry''' is the science of measuring the previous pressure and temperature history of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or intrusive [[igneous]] rocks. Geothermobarometry is a combination of ''geobarometry'', where a pressure of mineral formation is resolved, and ''geothermometry'' where a temperature of formation is resolved.

==Methodology==
Geothermobarometry relies upon understanding the temperature and pressure of the formation of  minerals within metamorphic and igneous rocks, and is particularly useful in metamorphic rocks. There are several methods of measuring the temperature or pressure of mineral formation relying on chemical [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between metamorphic minerals or by measuring the chemical composition of individual minerals.

Thermobarometry relies upon the fact that mineral pairs/assemblages vary their compositions as a function of temperature and pressure. There are numerous extra factors to consider such as oxygen [[fugacity]] and water activity (roughly, the same as concentration). The distribution of component elements between the mineral assemblages is then analysed using an [[electron microprobe]] or [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM).

Data on the geothermometers and geobarometers is derived from both laboratory studies on artificial mineral assemblages, where minerals are grown at known temperatures and pressures and the chemical equilibrium measured directly, and from calibration using natural systems.

For example, one of the best known and most widely applicable geothermometers is the garnet-biotite relationship where the relative proportions of Fe and Mg in garnet and biotite change with increasing temperature, so measurement of the compositions of these minerals to give the Fe-Mg distribution between them allows the temperature of crystallization to be calculated, given some assumptions.

===Assumptions===
In natural systems,  the chemical reactions occur in open systems with unknown geological and chemical histories, and application of geothermobarometers relies on several assumptions that must hold in order for the laboratory data and natural compositions to relate in a valid fashion:

* That the full mineralogical assemblage required for the thermobarometer is present. If not all of the minerals of the reaction are present, or did not equilibrate with each other simultaneously, then any pressures and temperatures calculated for the ideal reaction will deviate from those actually experienced by the rock.
* That chemical equilibrium was achieved to a satisfactory degree. This could be impossible to demonstrate definitively, if the minerals of the thermobarometer assemblage are not all observed in contact with each other.
* That any minerals in a two-mineral barometer or thermometer grew in equilibrium, which is assumed when the minerals are seen to be in contact.
* That the mineral assemblage has not been altered by retrograde metamorphism, which can be assessed using an optical microscope in most cases.
* That certain mineralogical assemblages are present. Without these, the accuracy of a reading may be altered from an ideal, and there may be more error inherent in the measurement.

==Techniques==
Some techniques include:

Various mineral assemblages rely more upon pressure than temperature; for example reactions which involve a large volume change. At high pressure, specific minerals assume lower volumes (therefore density increases, as the mass does not change) - it is these minerals which are good indicators of paleo-pressure.

A '''hydrogen atom''' is an [[atom]] of the [[chemical element]] [[hydrogen]]. The [[Electric charge|electrically]] neutral atom contains a single positively charged [[proton]] and a single negatively charged [[electron]] bound to the nucleus by the [[Coulomb force]]. '''Atomic hydrogen''' constitutes [[abundance of the chemical elements|about 75%]] of the [[baryon]]ic mass of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called "atomic hydrogen") are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary ([[diatomic]]) hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. "Atomic hydrogen" and "hydrogen atom" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).

[[Atomic spectroscopy]] shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of [[classical physics]]. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the [[history of quantum mechanics]], since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure.

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of hydrogen}}
The most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] [[isotope]], '''hydrogen-1''', '''protium''', or '''light hydrogen''', contains no [[neutron]]s and is simply a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]. Protium is [[Proton decay|stable]] and makes up 99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref name=Housecroft&gt;{{cite book |last1=Housecroft |first=Catherine E. |last2=Sharpe |first2=Alan G. |edition=2nd |date=2005 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall |page=237 |isbn=0130-39913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deuterium]] contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen&lt;ref name=Housecroft/&gt; and is used in industrial processes like [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Deuterium NMR|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]].

[[Tritium]] contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.

Higher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

The formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the [[Rydberg constant]] (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.

==Hydrogen ion==
{{Main|Hydron (chemistry)}}
Hydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as "H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" as in the solvation of classical acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]], the [[hydronium ion]], [[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Ionized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the [[interstellar medium]], and [[solar wind]].

==Theoretical analysis==
The hydrogen atom has special significance in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] as a simple [[two-body problem]] physical system which has yielded many simple [[closed-form expression|analytical]] solutions in closed-form.

=== Failed classical description ===
[[Rutherford model|Experiments]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. [[Classical electromagnetism]] had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the [[Larmor formula]]. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf|title = Classical Lifetime of a Bohr Atom|date = March 7, 2005|website = |publisher = Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University|last = Olsen|first = James|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_\text{fall} \approx \frac{ a_0^3}{4 r_0^2 c} \approx 1.6 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]] and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]]. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Bohr-Sommerfeld Model ===
{{Main|Bohr model}}In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:
# Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or ''stationary states'', thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.
# Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.
# An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital to another. 
Bohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:

&lt;math&gt;L = n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,3,...&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant]] over &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. He also supposed that the [[centripetal force]] which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch115/carter/files/103more/BohrEquations.pdf|title = Derivation of Bohr’s Equations for the One-electron Atom|website = |publisher = University of Massachusetts Boston|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E_n = - \frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } \frac{1}{n^2}   &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;m_e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]], &lt;math&gt;e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], and &lt;math&gt;n   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum number]] (now known as the [[principal quantum number]]). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the [[hydrogen spectral series]] to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used quantized values.

For &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the value

Mohr, B.N. Taylor, and D.B. Newell (2011), "The 2010 CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants" (Web Version 6.0). This database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. Available: http://physics.nist.gov/constants. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ryd Link to R&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;], [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydhcev Link to hcR&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
is called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the [[Rydberg constant]] &lt;math&gt;R_\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[atomic physics]] by &lt;math&gt;1 \,\text{Ry} \equiv h c R_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]), and hydrogen-3 ([[tritium]]) the constant must be slightly modified to use the [[reduced mass]] of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a hydrogen atom (one electron), ''R'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the atomic nucleus.  For hydrogen-1, the quantity &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{e}}/M,&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of ''R'', and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.

There were still problems with Bohr's model: 
# it failed to predict other spectral details such as [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]]
# it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for single–electron atoms (hydrogen–like atoms)
# the predicted values were only correct to &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 \approx 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]].

Most of these shortcomings were repaired by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Arnold Sommerfeld's]] modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[declination]] with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital [[angular momentum]] and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]] remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the [[Dirac equation]]. It is often alleged, that the [[Schrödinger equation]] is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories.  It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.

=== Schrödinger equation ===
The Schrödinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.

==== Wavefunction ====
The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schrödinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the [[reduced mass]] &lt;math&gt;\mu=m_e M/(m_e + M)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \nabla^2  - \frac{  e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \right) \psi(r,\theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] in spherical coordinates:

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{ \partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - \frac{e^2}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \psi= E \psi&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Separation of variables|separable]], [[partial differential equation]] which can be solved in terms of special functions.  The normalized position [[wavefunction]]s, given in [[spherical coordinates]] are:
::&lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi) = \sqrt {{\left (  \frac{2}{n a^*_0} \right )}^3 \frac{(n-\ell-1)!}{2n(n+\ell)!}} e^{- \rho / 2} \rho^{\ell} L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Hydrogen eigenstate n4 l3 m1.png|thumb|right|3D illustration of the eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\psi_{4,3,1}&lt;/math&gt;. Electrons in this state are 45% likely to be found within the solid body shown.]]
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \rho = {2r \over {n a^*_0}} &lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Bohr radius]], &lt;math&gt;a^*_0={{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}\over{\mu e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomial]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1}}, and
::&lt;math&gt; Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) \,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[spherical harmonic]] function of degree ''ℓ'' and order ''m''. Note that the generalized Laguerre polynomials are defined differently by different authors. The usage here is consistent with the definitions used by Messiah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messiah|first=Albert|title=Quantum Mechanics|date=1999|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-40924-4|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathematica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/LaguerreL.html LaguerreL]. Wolfram Mathematica page&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the Laguerre polynomial includes a factor of &lt;math&gt;(n+\ell)!&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; or the generalized Laguerre polynomial appearing in the hydrogen wave function is &lt;math&gt; L_{n+\ell}^{2\ell+1}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condon and Shortley|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|date=1963|publisher=Cambridge|location=London|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum numbers can take the following values: 
::&lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ell=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;m=-\ell,\ldots,\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, these wavefunctions are ''normalized'' (i.e., the integral of their modulus square equals 1) and [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonal]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} r^2 dr\int_0^{\pi} \sin \vartheta d\vartheta \int_0^{2 \pi} d\varphi\; \psi^*_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)\psi_{n'\ell'm'}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)=\langle n,\ell, m | n', \ell', m' \rangle = \delta_{nn'} \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{mm'},&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen are [[analytical expression|analytical]], giving a simple expression for the hydrogen [[energy levels]] and thus the frequencies of the hydrogen [[spectral line]]s and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function ("orbital") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the [[anisotropic]] character of atomic bonds.

The Schrödinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and [[molecule]]s. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.

Since the Schrödinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The [[Dirac equation]] of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).

==== Results of Schrödinger equation ====
The solution of the Schrödinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb potential]] produced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the ''orbitals'') are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[Spherical coordinate system|angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum [[quantum number]]s, ''ℓ'' and ''m'' (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} −''ℓ'', ..., +''ℓ''}} determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) ''z''-axis.

In addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/''r'' Coulomb potential enter (leading to [[Laguerre polynomials]] in ''r''). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...}}. The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.

Note that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to ''n'' − 1, i.e. {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}}.

Due to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ''ℓ'' but different ''m'' have the same energy (this holds for all problems with [[rotational symmetry]]). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same ''n'' but different ''ℓ'' are also [[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/''r'' (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).

Taking into account the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the ''z''-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any [[eigenstate]] of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of these states. This explains also why the choice of ''z''-axis for the directional [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ''ℓ'' and ''m''&amp;prime; obtained for another preferred axis ''z''&amp;prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different ''m'' (but same ''l'') that have been obtained for ''z''.

==== Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom ====
{{main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]], and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component "[[Dirac spinor]]" including "up" and "down" spin components, with both positive and "negative" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schrödinger solution.

=====Energy levels=====
The energy levels of hydrogen, including [[fine structure]] (excluding [[Lamb shift]] and [[hyperfine structure]]), are given by the [[Fine-structure constant|Sommerfeld fine structure]] expression:&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;{{cite book|first=Arnold |last= Sommerfeld|title=Atombau und Spektrallinien'|  publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig|year=1919|isbn=3-87144-484-7}} [https://archive.org/stream/atombauundspekt00sommgoog German] [https://archive.org/details/AtomicStructureAndSpectralLines English]&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} E_{j\,n} &amp; = -\mu c^2\left[1-\left(1+\left[\dfrac{\alpha}{n-j-\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2-\alpha^2}}\right]^2\right)^{-1/2}\right] \\ &amp; \approx -\dfrac{\mu c^2\alpha^2}{2n^2} \left[1 + \dfrac{\alpha^2}{n^2}\left(\dfrac{n}{j+\frac{1}{2}} - \dfrac{3}{4} \right) \right] , \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''j'' is the "total angular momentum" [[quantum number]], which is equal to |''ℓ'' ± {{sfrac|1|2}}| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schrödinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see [[#Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution]]). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]] in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the [[Old quantum theory|old Bohr theory]]. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.

=== Visualizing the hydrogen electron orbitals ===
{{main|Atomic orbital}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|Probability densities through the ''xz''-plane for the electron at different quantum numbers (''ℓ'', across top; ''n'', down side; ''m'' = 0)]]
The image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number ''ℓ'' is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (''s'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''d'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2). The main (principal) quantum number ''n'' (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number ''m'' has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the ''xz''-plane (''z'' is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the ''z''-axis.

The "[[ground state]]", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1''s'' state ([[principal quantum level]] ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0).

Black lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero.  (More precisely, the nodes are [[spherical harmonics]] that appear as a result of solving [[Schrödinger equation]] in polar coordinates.)

The [[quantum number]]s determine the layout of these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.byu.edu/faculty/durfee/courses/Summer2009/physics222/AtomicQuantumNumbers.pdf Summary of atomic quantum numbers]. Lecture notes. 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There are:
* &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; total nodes,
* &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are angular nodes:
** &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; angular nodes go around the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; axis (in the xy plane). &lt;small&gt;(The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-sections through the xz-plane.)&lt;/small&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining angular nodes) occur on the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (vertical) axis.
* &lt;math&gt;n - l - 1&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.

==== Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution ====
There are several important effects that are neglected by the Schrödinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:

* Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of the [[speed of light]], many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.
* Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], in the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated [[magnetic moment]] which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e., an interaction between the [[electron]]'s [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus, and its [[spin (physics)|spin]].

Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same ''j'' and the same ''n'' are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of [[Dirac equation]] predicts 2S({{sfrac|1|2}}) and 2P({{sfrac|1|2}}) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations ([[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]]).

* There are always [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]].

For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.

== Alternatives to the Schrödinger theory ==
In the language of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[matrix mechanics]], the hydrogen  atom was first solved by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref name="pauli_1926"&gt;

and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]]. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the [[dynamical group]] O(4,2),
the entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group representation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements''' ('''KPU''') is an [[axiom system]] for [[set theory]] with [[urelement]]s, based on the traditional (urelement-free) [[Kripke–Platek set theory]]. It is considerably weaker than the (relatively) familiar system [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFU]]. The purpose of allowing urelements is to allow large or high-complexity objects (such as [[Baire space (set theory)|the set of all reals]]) to be included in the theory's transitive models without disrupting the usual well-ordering and recursion-theoretic properties of the [[constructible universe]]; KP is so weak that this is hard to do by [[constructible universe#relative constructibility|traditional means]].

==Preliminaries==

The usual way of stating the axioms presumes a two sorted first order language &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; with a single binary relation symbol  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;.
Letters of the sort &lt;math&gt;p,q,r,...&lt;/math&gt; designate urelements, of which there may be none, whereas letters of the sort &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,...&lt;/math&gt; designate sets. The letters &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,...&lt;/math&gt; may denote both sets and urelements.

The letters for sets may appear on both sides of &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, while those for urelements may only appear on the left, i.e. the following are examples of valid expressions: &lt;math&gt;p\in a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b\in a&lt;/math&gt;.

The statement of the axioms also requires reference to a certain collection of formulae called &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formulae. The collection &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt; consists of those formulae that can be built using the constants, &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, and bounded quantification. That is quantification of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \exists x \in a&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is given set.

==Axioms==

The axioms of KPU are the [[universal closure]]s of the following formulae:

* [[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \in a \leftrightarrow x\in b)\rightarrow a=b&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom of regularity|Foundation]]: This is an [[axiom schema]] where for every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\exists a. \phi(a) \rightarrow \exists a (\phi(a) \wedge \forall x\in a\,(\neg \phi(x)))&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Axiom of pairing|Pairing]]: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\, (x\in a \land y\in a )&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom of union|Union]]: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \forall c \in b. \forall y\in c (y \in a)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Axiom schema of predicative separation|&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-Separation]]: This is again an [[axiom schema]], where for every &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; we have the following &lt;math&gt;\exists a \forall x \,(x\in a \leftrightarrow x\in b \wedge \phi(x) )&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-[[Axiom schema of replacement|Collection]]: This is also an [[axiom schema]], for every &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;-formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in a.\exists y. \phi(x,y)\rightarrow \exists b\forall x \in a.\exists y\in b. \phi(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;.
* Set Existence: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\, (a=a)&lt;/math&gt;

===Additional assumptions===
Technically these are axioms that describe the partition of objects into sets and urelements.

* &lt;math&gt;\forall p \forall a (p \neq a)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall p \forall x (x \notin p)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

KPU can be applied to the model theory of [[infinitary language]]s. [[model theory|Models]] of KPU considered as sets inside a maximal universe that are [[transitive set|transitive]] as such are called [[admissible set]]s.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Man: Whence, How and Whither, A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''', published in 1913, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the second president of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society (TS) - Adyar]], [[Annie Besant]], and by a TS member, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]].{{refn|group=note|According to [[WorldCat]], "18 editions published between 1913 and 1984 in English and held by 177 WorldCat member libraries worldwide."{{sfn|WorldCat}}}} The book is a study on early [[Round (Theosophy)|times]] on planetary chains, beginnings of early [[root races]], early [[civilization]]s and empires, and past lives of men.{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}{{refn|group=note|There were other collaborative authors [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] works, [[Occult Chemistry (book)|''Occult Chemistry'']] (1908) and ''The Lives of Alcyone'' (1924).{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1013}}}}

== Introduction ==
[[File:Solar syst.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven Schemes of our [[Solar System]].{{refn|group=note|"At any one period of time only one of the rings in each Scheme will be active; each ring of each of these seven Schemes is composed of seven globes."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=4}}}}]]
At the beginning of the book the authors wrote that "metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation, ''i.e.'', under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness." Hence, when a mystic turn the soul away from earth and focuses his attention upon the spirit – the soul may approach the "Memory of Nature", the personification in the material world of the "Thoughts of the [[Logos]]," the image, as it were, of "His Mind." There resides the Past in [[Akashic Records|ever-living records]].{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|pp=iv–v}}{{sfn|Cayce|1968}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=985}}{{sfn|Cerminara|1988}}{{sfn|Todeschi|1998}}{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=106–7}}

The authors say that "they, having been taught the method of gaining touch, but being subject to the difficulties involved in their uncompleted evolution, have done their best to observe and transmit, but are fully conscious of the many weaknesses which mar their work. Occasional help has been given to them by the [[Mahatma|Elder Brethren]]."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=v}}

Leadbeater speculated that "the total number of souls, or [[Monad (philosophy)|Monads]],{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} making up humanity was sixty thousand million, the majority being out of incarnation at any given time."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1010}} Thus [[reincarnation]]{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=408}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} had been one of the doctrines of the [[Theosophical Society]] almost from its beginnings.

Leadbeater wrote later that "the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole".{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1924|loc=Foreword}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] said, "The series of incarnations showed these pioneers going through their own evolution from subhumans to worldly and spiritual leaders of the race."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}

== Early root races ==

=== In Lemuria ===

In the chapter VII the authors describe in detail{{refn|group=note|"Leadbeater wrote elaborate descriptions of these things in a style of simplicity and clearness," — claimed Kuhn.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=329}}}} a remarkable Lemurian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] there was some domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky stated that the Lemurian is "the first physical man which itself took place 18,000,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=46|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}} was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw – among some tribes human flesh was not despised – and creatures of the grade of our slugs, snails and worms, much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=105|Tillett|1986|2p=452}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote, "Leadbeater regularly adopts an archly humorous tone when dealing with disgusting habits, ugly people, or lowly human types."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|p=99}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Atlantis ===
In the chapter IX the authors wrote about [[Atlantis]] that "explosions of gas, floods and earthquakes" razed Ruta and Daitya, the great islands, left from the cataclysm of 200,000 B.C., and only the island of Poseidonis remained, the last vestige of the once grand continent of the Atlantis. These islands were lost in 75,025 B.C., Poseidonis survived to 9,564 B.C., when it also was devoured by the ocean.{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=132|Lubelsky|2013|2p=351}}

The authors assert in the chapter X of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The immense growth of wealth and of luxury gradually undermined the most splendid civilization that the world has yet seen. Knowledge was prostituted to individual gain, and control over the powers of nature was turned from service to oppression. Hence Atlantis fell, despite the glory of its achievements and the might of its Empires."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky claimed, "The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of [[Plato|Plato's]] Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids... The great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1pp=429, 432|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== On the Moon chain ==
[[File:Seven chains.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven planetary chains and the five planes.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=5}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}]]
Blavatsky wrote in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''  that the [[Moon]] "plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the [[Earth]] itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings". The "Lunar Monads" or Pitris, the progenitors of man, become in reality man himself.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=180}} A religious studies scholar Isaac Lubelsky stated that Besant and Leadbeater write in the book the chain of the Moon "was an evolutionary precursor of the chain of the planet Earth."{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}

In the chapter III the authors describe in detail how Sirius, Alcyone, Herakles and Mizar{{refn|group=note|[[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] — J. Nityananda (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} achieved individualization{{refn|group=note|"The divine life begins the evolution of consciousness, building for itself forms on the various planes, passing slowly through the elemental, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, and finally reaching self-consciousness and individualization, when it passes into the human stage."{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=407}}}} and left the animal kingdom while living as lunar monkey-creatures.{{refn|group=note|The lunar [[manvantara]] generated seven classes of the entities for the earthly manvantara.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=235}}}} They were servants to a family of lunar men, the leaders of which are now the Masters [[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] and [[Kuthumi|K.H.]]{{refn|group=note|[[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] — [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] — [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}}} Leadbeater wrote that "individualization from the animal kingdom usually takes place through association with the humanity of the period. Such examples of it as we occasionally see taking place round us at the present time will serve as instances for us." Some peculiar domestic animal, well treated by its human friends, is stimulated by its permanent contact with them up to the point where it breaks away from the group-soul to which it has previously belonged.{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/6}} The authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring up around their master's hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya{{refn|group=note|"Surya — the Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the present Bodhisattva, the Supreme Teacher of the world" (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} begins to carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bearing him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle, kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body.  Meanwhile, a savage slips behind Mars and stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering himself, turns. He recognizes his faithful animal defender, bends over his dying servant, and places his head in his lap. The poor monkey lifts his eyes, full of intense devotion, to his master's face, and the act of service done, with passionate desire to save, calls down a stream of response from the Will aspect of the Monad in a fierce rush of power, and in the very moment of dying the monkey individualizes, and thus he dies – a man."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1pp=35–6|Tillett|1986|2pp=450–51}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fruits of Evolution ==
[[File:Life-waves.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Successive Life-waves.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=7}}{{refn|group=note|"The vertical columns indicate the successive incarnations of the Chain; the horizontal divisions represent the various kingdoms of nature; the diagonal arrows are the successive waves of Evolution which have come forth from the [[Logos]]."{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/3}}}}]]
The theosophical concept of Evolution suppose spiritual development of the Mankind will attain the fullness of the stature of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus|Christ]], etc. of the prize of the high calling of God in Christianity.{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=324}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}}

The authors the book proclaimed "when the Human Kingdom is traversed, and man stands on the threshold of His superhuman life, a liberated Spirit", seven paths open before Him for His choosing: He may enter into the blissful omniscience and omnipotence of [[Nirvana]], with activities far beyond our knowing, to become, perchance, in some future world an [[Avatara]], or godlike Incarnation; this is sometimes called, "taking the [[Dharmakaya]] vesture". He may enter on "the Spiritual Period" — a phrase including unknown meanings, among them probably that of "taking the [[Sambhogakaya]] vesture". He may become part of that treasure-house of spiritual forces on which the Agents of the [[Logos]] draw for Their work, "taking the [[Nirmanakaya]] vesture". He may remain a member of the [[Great White Brotherhood|Occult Hierarchy]] which rules and guards the world in which He has reached perfection. He may pass on to the next Chain, to aid in constructing its forms. He may enter the majestic Angel – Deva-Evolution. He may give Himself to the immediate service of the Logos, to be used by Him in any part of the [[Solar System]], His Servant and Messenger, who lives but to carry out His will and do His work over the whole of the system which He controls.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=12}}

== Criticism ==
A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote in his thesis that ''The Canadian Theosophist'', a magazine published at [[Toronto]], announced a series of articles in which "parallel passages from the writings of Mrs. Blavatsky and the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' on one side, and from the books of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, on the other (''Man: whence, how and whither'' included), gave specific evidence bearing on the claims of perversion of the original theories by those whom they call [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]]."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=330}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas stated, "Many, many have doubtless been turned away from genuine Theosophy after being exposed to the obvious gibberish of 'Leadbeaterism' and not being aware of the difference."{{sfn|Thomas}}}}

John Prentice in an article ''Clairvoyant Research'' criticized the book of the authors. He proclaimed that the material for the [[Peru]]vian lives in ''Man: whence, how and whither'' (Ch. XI) had been lifted out of Garcilaso de la Vega's ''Royal Commentaries on the Yuccas of Peru'' (written in 1609 and published in English translation in 1638, 1869 and 1871).{{sfn|Prentice|1923}}

Joseph Fussell wrote about "abnormal and preposterous claims" published by Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Fussell|1914}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=630–31}}

[[Helena Roerich]] stated that Leadbeater's books are a mix of "false and ugly" statements and some fragments of truth: one of the [[Mahatma|Great Masters]] supposedly called the book ''Man: Whence, How and Whither'' as "a work which devoid of knowledge, honesty and beauty."{{sfn|Рерих|2001}} She wrote: "The book by Besant and Leadbeater is particularly awful, therein is described the lives supposedly the Great Masters and some their pupils, namely: Besant, Leadbeater... I've never seen anything equal to this tasteless blasphemy and falsehood."{{sfn|Рерих|1993|p=45}}

Professor [[Olav Hammer]] stated that Leadbeater's claims about past lives "were increasingly used to buttress power struggles." He wrote, "Those who supported the controversial Leadbeater were recorded as having had important roles in the past, while his opponents were depicted as villains."
{{sfnm|Washington|1995|1p=129|Hammer|2003|2p=474}} In his thesis Hammer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How can Leadbeater's readers know that his clairvoyant results really are 'records' and 'information', rather than delusions or deliberate fabrications? His response is feeble, 'there is no assurance. The investigators themselves are certain &lt;...&gt; of the difference between observation and imagination'."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=485|Hammer|2003|2p=474}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alice Bailey]] stated that the book published at Adyar by Besant and Leadbeater was "psychic in his implications and impossible of verification". In her ''Unfinished Autobiography'' she wrote that it proved to her the "untrustworthiness" of Leadbeater's writings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Books were being published at Adyar by Mr. Leadbeater that were psychic in their implications and impossible of verification,  carrying a strong note of astralism. One of his major works, ''Man: Whence, How and Whither,'' was a book that proved to me the basic untrustworthiness of what he wrote. It is a book that outlines the future and the work of the Hierarchy of the future, and the curious and arresting thing to me was that the majority of the people slated to hold high office in the Hierarchy and in the future coming civilisation were all Mr. Leadbeater's personal friends. I knew some of these people—worthy, kind, and mediocre, none of them intellectual giants and most of them completely unimportant."{{sfn|Bailey|2013|loc=Ch. IV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has won international acclaim for his first of its kind six floor high 5000 sq ft in facade and 10000 sq ft of total painted surface, commissioned mega [[mural]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourchennai.com/index.php/technology/science/769-sunil-bharti-mittal-unveils-5-storey-high-mural-at-the-airtel-centre-in-gurgaon |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424041724/http://www.yourchennai.com/index.php/technology/science/769-sunil-bharti-mittal-unveils-5-storey-high-mural-at-the-airtel-centre-in-gurgaon |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the headquarters of leading telecom corporate giant in Gurgaon near Delhi,India in 2010, where he  painted Live for three months while involving thousands of employees’ brush strokes in his creation&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/people/The-big-picture-by-Manav-Gupta/iplarticleshow/6167629.cms&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tree of Life mural (Manav Gupta)|"The Tree of Life"]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article611626.ece&lt;/ref&gt;
The Tree of Life is the tallest and largest three-dimensional indoor staircase mural&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limcabookofrecords.in/subcategory_detailed.asp?cat=PAINTING&amp;id=81#&lt;/ref&gt; by artist Manav Gupta. It covers approximately 5,000 sq ft of visible frontage through a glass façade and 10,000 sq ft of total painted surface. Its significance lies in the methodology of creation as a work of contemporary art, with the first of its kind simultaneous use of four different art practices in conceptual, site specific, collaborative and performance art.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-13/people/28308156_1_paint-mural-employees&lt;/ref&gt;

When commissioned by [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd to create a "staircase artwork"&lt;ref&gt;http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/bharti-airtel-racing-for-top-telecom-firm-spot/1/17990.html&lt;/ref&gt; at their headquarters, the artist introduced a unique sustainable development process in corporate entity, by establishing that art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees. 
Adding a collaborative dimension, he conceptualised the mural as a public art project by allowing thousands of employees the experience of putting brush strokes. In the process, a series of role plays of teaching and motivating employees took effect as performance art. In the second half of the project, a three dimensional site specific composition took shape. With Gupta working solo all through the day,live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the corporate campus site, the mural took three months to complete as an evolving storyline of five elements in Nature. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60&amp;nbsp;ft high glass facade,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mittal-unveils-5storey-high-mural-at-airtel-centre/650710/1&lt;/ref&gt; the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition.
He has pioneered co-creation with his "Jugalbandis" (Collaborations) with leading musicians,poets,dancers including Dr.L.Subramanium,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/36719111@N03/3386555395/in/photostream/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Anup Jalota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=51185 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002423/http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=51185 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rahul Sharma (musician)|Rahul Sharma]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apexstuff.com/bt/200709/intown.asp&lt;/ref&gt; where he translates a performing artist's oveure LIVE on stage on canvas(2003–2011).He has co authored a book of poems and paintings with former President of India Dr [[A.P.J.

If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]

Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

*&lt;u&gt;Passive negative differential resistance devices&lt;/u&gt; (fig. 2 above): These are the most well-known type of "negative resistances"; passive two-terminal components whose intrinsic ''I–V'' curve has a downward "kink", causing the current to decrease with increasing voltage over a limited range.&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; The ''I–V'' curve, including the negative resistance region, lies in the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the plane&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; so the device has positive static resistance.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; Examples are [[gas-discharge tube]]s, [[tunnel diode]]s, and [[Gunn diode]]s.&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt; These devices have no internal power source and in general work by converting external DC power from their port to time varying (AC) power,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; so they require a DC bias current applied to the port in addition to the signal.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; To add to the confusion, some authors&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; call these "active" devices, since they can amplify.

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

An intrinsic parameter used to compare different devices is the ''peak-to-valley current ratio'' (PVR),&lt;ref name="Franz" /&gt; the ratio of the current at the top of the negative resistance region to the current at the bottom ''(see graphs, above)'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{PVR} = i_1 / i_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The larger this is, the larger the potential AC output for a given DC bias current, and therefore the greater the efficiency

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel diode ''TD'' has voltage controlled negative differential resistance.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; The battery &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt; adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

For simple nonreactive negative resistance devices with &lt;math&gt;R_N\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_N\;=\;0&lt;/math&gt; the different operating regions of the device can be illustrated by [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s on the ''I–V'' curve&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; ''(see graphs)''.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].

If an [[LC circuit]] is connected across the input of a positive feedback amplifier like that above, the negative differential input resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{if}&lt;/math&gt; can cancel the positive loss resistance &lt;math&gt;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt; inherent in the tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;this property was often called "resistance neutralization" in the days of vacuum tubes, see {{cite journal

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

===Negative impedance converter===

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

[[File:Negative resistance oscillator load lines.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Gunn diode oscillator [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name="Kung2" /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K.

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

[[Image:New Earth Time clock.png|thumb|300px|right|An example New Earth Time analog clock]]
'''New Earth Time''' (or '''NET''') is an alternative naming system for measuring the time of day. In NET the day is split into 360 NET degrees, each NET degree is split into 60 NET minutes and each NET minute is split into 60 NET seconds. One NET degree is therefore equivalent to four standard minutes, and one standard hour is equivalent to 15 NET degrees.

NET is equivalent to the UTC read from a 24-hour analog clock as the clockwise angle past midnight of the hour hand. For example, noon is 180°0'0" NET and at that time the hour hand is pointing straight down forming a 180° angle when measured from the top, at midnight. A full circle is 360 degrees and one NET day.

==History==
New Earth Time was invented on 15 September 1999 by Mark Laugesen from Auckland. The rights to the name New Earth Time (or NET) and slogan "360 degrees of time" are novel and owned by degree NET Ltd. Similar ideas for unifying time measurement across the globe include [[Swatch Internet Time]], another [[rebranding]] of [[UTC]]+1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">[[File:Definition-of-a-nodal-decomposition.jpg|thumb|Nodal decomposition.]] In [[category theory]], an abstract mathematical discipline, a '''nodal decomposition'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=28}} of a morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a representation of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as a product &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma\circ\beta\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[strong epimorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;An [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''strong''', if for any [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\mu:C\to D&lt;/math&gt; and for any morphisms &lt;math&gt;\alpha:A\to C&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\beta:B\to D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta\circ\varepsilon=\mu\circ\alpha&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;\delta:B\to C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\delta\circ\varepsilon=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu\circ\delta=\beta&lt;/math&gt;. [[File:Diagram-orthogonality-2.jpg|thumb]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Borceux|1994}}{{sfn|Tsalenko|1974}}, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; a [[bimorphism]], and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; a [[strong monomorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;A [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\mu:C\to D&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''strong''', if for any [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and for any morphisms &lt;math&gt;\alpha:A\to C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta:B\to D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta\circ\varepsilon=\mu\circ\alpha&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;\delta:B\to C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\delta\circ\varepsilon=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu\circ\delta=\beta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Borceux|1994}}{{sfn|Tsalenko|1974}}.

== Uniqueness and notations == 
[[File:Uniqueness-of-nodal-decomposition-2.jpg|thumb|Uniqueness of the nodal decomposition.]] If exists, the nodal decomposition is unique up to an isomorphism in the following sense: for any two  nodal decompositions &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma\circ\beta\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma'\circ\beta'\circ\pi'&lt;/math&gt; there exist [[Morphism#Isomorphisms|isomorphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; such that 
: &lt;math&gt;\pi'=\eta\circ\pi,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta=\theta\circ\beta'\circ\eta,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma'=\sigma\circ\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Nodal-decomposition-notations.jpg|thumb|Notations.]] 
This property justifies some special notations for the elements of the nodal decomposition: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \pi=\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp; 
P=\operatorname{Coim}_\infty \varphi,\\
&amp; \beta=\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp;  \\
&amp; \sigma=\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp;  
Q=\operatorname{Im}_\infty \varphi,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; 
– here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Coim}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''nodal coimage of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'', &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the ''nodal image of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'', and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the ''nodal reduced part of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''.

In these notations the nodal decomposition takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi\circ\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi \circ \operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection with the basic decomposition in pre-abelian categories == 
In a [[pre-abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; each morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a standard decomposition 
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{im} \varphi\circ\operatorname{red} \varphi\circ\operatorname{coim} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;,
called the ''basic decomposition'' (here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im} \varphi=\ker(\operatorname{coker} \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim} \varphi=\operatorname{coker}(\ker\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the image, the coimage and the reduced part of the morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:Nodal-and-basic-decomposition-1.jpg|thumb|Nodal and basic decompositions.]] If a morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in a [[pre-abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; has a nodal decomposition, then there exist morphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; which (being not necessarily isomorphisms) connect the nodal decomposition with the basic decomposition by the following identities:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi=\eta\circ\operatorname{coim} \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red} \varphi=\theta\circ\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi\circ\eta,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi=\operatorname{im} \varphi\circ\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

== Categories with nodal decomposition == 
A category &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''category with nodal decomposition''{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=28}} if each morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a nodal decomposition in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt;. This property plays an important role in constructing [[envelope (category theory)|envelope]]s and [[refinement (category theory)|refinement]]s in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; the basic decomposition
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{im} \varphi\circ\operatorname{red} \varphi\circ\operatorname{coim} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
is always nodal. As a corollary, ''all abelian categories have nodal decomposition''. 

''If a [[pre-abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is linearly complete&lt;ref name=linearly-complete&gt; A category &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''linearly complete'', if any functor from a linearly ordered set into &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; has [[direct limit|direct]] and [[inverse limit]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;, well-powered in strong monomorphisms&lt;ref name=well-powered-in-strong-monomorphisms&gt;A category &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''well-powered in strong monomorphisms'', if for each object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SMono}(X)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[strong monomorphism]]s into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is skeletally small (i.e. has a skeleton which is a set).&lt;/ref&gt; and co-well-powered in strong epimorphisms&lt;ref name=co-well-powered-in-strong-epimorphisms&gt;A category &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''co-well-powered in strong epimorphisms'', if for each object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SEpi}(X)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[strong epimorphism]]s from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is skeletally small (i.e. has a skeleton which is a set).&lt;/ref&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; has nodal decomposition.{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=37}}''

'''Occasionalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory about [[Causality|causation]] which says that created substances cannot be [[efficient cause]]s of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by [[God]]. (A related theory, which has been called "occasional causation", also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, 'The Occasionalism of Louis de la Forge', in Nadler (ed.), ''Causation in Early Modern Philosophy'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 57–73;  Nadler, 'Descartes and Occasional Causation', ''British Journal for the History of Philosophy'', 2 (1994) 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event ''causes'' God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.

== Islamic theological schools ==
The doctrine first reached prominence in the [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] schools of [[Iraq]], especially in [[Basra]]. The ninth century theologian [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] argued that there is no [[Secondary Causation]] in the created order.  The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God.

The most famous proponent of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] occasionalist doctrine was [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]], an 11th-century theologian based in [[Baghdad]]. In ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank | last = Griffel | title = Al-Ghazali's Philosophical Theology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}} Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]-influenced [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]. In response to the philosophers' claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an [[ontological]] and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|using logic]]. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], using his expertise in the [[Science in medieval Islam|natural sciences]] of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] and [[Physics in medieval Islam|physics]].

Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[physical law|laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that ''appears'' unusual ''to us''. Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles.

In 1993, Karen Harding's paper "Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory" described several "remarkable" similarities between Ghazali's concept of occasionalism and the (disputed) [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. She stated: "In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al Ghazili) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harding | first = Karen | title = Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory | date = Summer 1993 | journal = The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences | url = http://www.ghazali.org/articles/harding-V10N2-Summer-93.pdf | volume = 10 | number = 2 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 article in ''[[Studia Islamica]]'', Lenn Goodman asks the question, "Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?"&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan. “Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?” Studia Islamica, no. 47, 1978, pp. 83–120. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1595550.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, "worldly" causation. According to Goodman's analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no ''necessary'' link between observed cause and effect.

== Dualism ==
One of the motivations for the theory is the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their [[essence]]s that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary.

The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 299–305.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: [[Johannes Clauberg]], [[Claude Clerselier]], [[Gerauld de Cordemoy]], [[Arnold Geulincx]], [[Louis de La Forge]], [[François Lamy (theologian)|François Lamy]], and (most notably), [[Nicolas Malebranche]].

== Hume's arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz ==
These occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that "We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', sect. 7, pt. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. [[George Berkeley]] was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, "visibly inactive".&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', sect. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in ''itself''. The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the [[pre-established harmony]] between the alterations produced immanently within different substances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10702">The '''open-question argument''' is a philosophical [[argument]] put forward by British philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 §13] of ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903),&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to refute the equating of the property of goodness with some non-moral property, X, whether naturalistic (e.g. [[Hedonism|pleasure]]) or supernatural (e.g. [[Divine command theory|God's command]]). That is, Moore's argument attempts to show that no moral property is identical to a natural property.&lt;ref&gt;

 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RUicWaTjPJUC&amp;pg=PA230
}}, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument takes the form of syllogistic [[modus tollens]]:

: Premise 1: If X is (analytically equivalent to) good, then the question "Is it true that ''X'' is good?" is meaningless.

: Premise 2: The question "Is it true that ''X'' is good?" is not meaningless (i.e. it is an open question).

: Conclusion: X is not (analytically equivalent to) good.

The type of question Moore refers to in this argument is an identity question, "Is it true that X is ''Y''?"  Such a question is an ''open question'' if a conceptually competent speaker can question this; otherwise the question is ''closed.''  For example, "I know he is a vegan, but does he eat meat?" would be a closed question.  However, "I know that it is pleasurable, but is it good?" is an open question; the question cannot be deduced from the conceptual terms alone.

The open-question argument claims that any attempt to identify morality with some set of observable, natural properties will always be an open question (unlike, say, a horse, which can be defined in terms of observable properties).  Moore further argued that if this is true, then moral facts cannot be reduced to natural properties and that therefore [[ethical naturalism]] is false.  Put another way, what Moore is saying is that any attempt to define good in terms of a naturalistic property fails because all definitions can be transformed into closed questions (the subject and predicate being conceptually identical; it is given in language itself that the two terms mean the same thing); however, all purported naturalistic definitions of good are transformable into open questions.  It is still controversial whether good is the same thing as pleasure, etc.  Shortly before (in section §11), Moore said if good is defined as pleasure (or any other naturalistic property) "good" may be substituted for "pleasure" anywhere it occurs.  However, "pleasure is good" is a meaningful, informative statement; but "good is good" (after making the substitution) is an empty, non-informative tautology.

==Objections and rejoinders==

===Begging the question===

The idea that Moore [[Begging the question|begs the question]] (i.e. assumes the conclusion in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 |last1= Miller |first1= Alexander
 |year= 2003
 |title= An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics
 |publisher= Polity
 |edition= 2nd
 |isbn= 978-0745646596
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically results in the question "Is it true that X is Y?" being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), to say that the question is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs the question in the second premise. He assumes that the question is a meaningful one (i.e. that it is an open question). This begs the question and the open-question argument thus fails.

In response to this, the open-question argument can be reformulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Darwall-Gibbard-Railton reformulation argues for the impossibility of equating a moral property with a non-moral one using the internalist theory of motivation.


This evidently presupposes the internalist theory of motivation (i.e. a belief can itself motivate), in contrast to the externalist theory of motivation, also known as the Humean theory of motivation (i.e. both a belief and a desire are required to motivate). If internalism is true, then the OQA avoids begging the question against the naturalist, and succeeds in showing that the good cannot be equated to some other property.

The argument is also contested on the grounds of the supremacy of internalism. Internalism is supported by the [[belief–desire–intention model]] of motivation, whereby desire (i.e. that some proposition ought to be made or kept true) and belief (i.e. that some proposition is true) combine to form intention, and thereby, action. To argue for the special motivational effects of moral beliefs is to commit the fallacy of [[special pleading]].

===Meaningful analysis===

The main assumption within the open-question argument can be found within premise 1. It is assumed that analytic equivalency will result in meaningless analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if we understand Concept C, and Concept C* can be analysed in terms of Concept C, then we should grasp concept C* by virtue of our understanding of Concept C. Yet it is obvious that such understanding of Concept C* only comes about through the analysis proper. Mathematics would be the prime example: mathematics is tautological and its claims are true by definition, yet we can develop new mathematical conceptions and theorems. Thus, X (i.e. some non-moral property) might well be analytically equivalent to the good, and still the question of "Is ''X'' good?" can be meaningful. Ergo premise 1 does not hold and the argument falls.

===Frege sense–reference distinction===
{{Main|Sense and reference}}

Sense and reference are two different aspects of some terms' [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]]. A term's ''reference'' is the ''object'' to which the term refers, while the term's ''sense'' is the ''way'' that the term refers to that object.  

There is a difference between the sense of a term and its reference (i.e. the object itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we can understand a claim like "goodness is identical with pleasure" as an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identity claim similar to "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O". The question "This is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O but is it water?" is intelligible and so, in that limited sense, whether or not water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an open question; note that this does not address the issue of significance. But that does not lead us to conclude that water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an identity claim that is known to be true ''a posteriori'' (i.e., it was discovered via empirical investigation).  Another example is "redness" being identical to certain phenomena of electromagnetism.  This is discovered by empirical investigation. Similarly, many moral naturalists argue that "rightness" can be discovered as an ''a posteriori'' truth, by investigating the different claims, like that of pleasure being the good, or of duty being the good.

This is done by invoking rightness and wrongness to explain certain empirical phenomena, and then discovering ''a posteriori'' whether maximizing utility occupies the relevant explanatory role.&lt;ref&gt;

}}, p. 28. &lt;!-- Original editor did not specify which edition. Using 1st. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, they argue that since right actions contingently have certain effects e.g. being causally responsible for a tendency towards social stability—so it follows we can fix the term "right" refer to the empirical description "the property of acts, whatever it is, that is causally responsible for their tendency towards social stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFollette|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  With this description for "right," we can then investigate which acts accomplish this: e.g. those actions that maximize utility.  We can then conclude that we have learned that "right" refers to "maximizing utility" through ''a posteriori'' means.

The Frege sense–reference distinction can be understood in layman's terms by using the analogy of the Masked Man.&lt;ref&gt;Fyfe, A. : Desire Utilitarianism, {{cite web|url=http://www.alonzofyfe.com/article_du.shtml |accessdate=September 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420155930/http://alonzofyfe.com/article_du.shtml |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A citizen living on the frontiers of the Wild West is told by the sheriff that his brother is the Masked Man who has recently been robbing banks. The citizen protests that he understands who his brother is, and who the Masked Man is supposed to be, and can meaningfully ask, "Is my brother the Masked Man?" Obviously, analytic equivalency is of no relevance here. The matter is an empirical one, which the citizen must investigate a posteriori. The absurdity of dismissing the claim as such is apparent.

However, the above account of a sort of ''a posteriori'' moral search is unsatisfactory in that normal value, and not moral value, can be used to explain the relevant events. Normal value arises from the relationship between desire and a state of affairs. People tend also to objectify such value, into categorical moral value, though this is fallacious. So, a situation that can be explained by the existence of real moral value (e.g. the fulfillment of preferences, the tendency towards social stability) can also be explained by non-moral value. This explanation is far simpler, given the ontological difficulties surrounding moral value. As J. L. Mackie argued with his [[argument from queerness]], moral values (i.e. oughts) that exist in the natural world (of facts), is highly queer, and we ought to favour a completely naturalistic explanation instead.&lt;ref&gt;

}}. &lt;!-- Originally published by Pelican Books in 1977. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the ''a posteriori'' moral search is that we lack an epistemic account of how we access moral facts. This is the epistemic aspect of Mackie's argument from queerness.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Mackie|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Failing such an account, the postulation of moral value will be egregious.

'''Parā Vidyā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परा विद्या) is a combination of two words – ''parā'', in [[Hindu philosophy]], means  - existence, paramount object, the highest point or degree, final beatitude; and ''vidyā'' means -  knowledge, philosophy, science, learning, scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary| publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Para Vidya'' means – higher learning or learning related to the Self or the Ultimate Truth i.e. transcendental knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dictionary of Spiritual Words|url= http://www.dictionaryofspiritualterms.com/public/Glossaries/terms.aspx?ID=736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedanta]] affirms that those who gain the knowledge of the Self attain [[kaivalya]], they become liberated, they become [[Brahman]].


Saunaka, having asked – कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति (" Revered Sir, what is that by the knowing of which all this becomes known? "), - was told by [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]] that – 

: द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये इति ह् स्म यद्ब्रह्मविदो वदन्ति परा चैवापरा च |
: तत्रापरा ऋग्वेदो यजुर्वेदः सामवेदोऽथर्ववेदः शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दो ज्योतिषमिति |
: अथ परा यया तदक्षरमधिग्म्यते || - ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] I.i.3-5)

there were two different kinds of knowledge to be acquired – 'the higher knowledge' or '''Para Vidya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परा विद्या )and 'the lower knowledge' or ''Apara Vidya''. The lower knowledge consists of all textual knowledge - the four [[Vedas]], the science of pronunciation etc., the code of rituals, grammar, etymology, metre and astrology. The higher knowledge is by which the immutable and the imperishable [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is realized, which knowledge brings about the direct realization of the Supreme Reality, the source of All. The knowledge of the Atman is very subtle; it cannot be obtained out of one’s own effort; the Atman cannot be intuitively apprehended by mere intellectual equipments. Thus, Angiras draws the distinction between the way of knowledge and the way of realization, as between opinion and truth. For understanding this for realizing the Reality the aspirant must seek a teacher. The teacher who has already realized his identity with the Atman alone can impart this much sought-after wisdom on the strength of his own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=240|url= https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Spirituality and the Modernization of India|publisher=Anthem Press|pages=18,19|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ey1v6JEmvakC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=para+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LTUGVYqTHceMuASWnIHwBg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;


A human being is blessed with the faculty of self-knowledge which is ''Apara Vidya'' or logical reasoning and also with the faculty of understanding and self-awareness which is ''Para Vidya'' or quantum logic. ''Para Vidya'' is defined as the intuitive vision of non-duality;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Symbiosis of Science and Spirituality Generation|publisher=Gyan Publishing|page=98|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HOivyL0bzOMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=para+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YT4GVbutB9bmuQTk54GYDg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the transcendental knowledge which is beyond all limits of knowledge, experience and reason, which is, beyond intellect, mind and sense. The [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], which is Truth, which is Reality, is neither an expression nor a reflection of itself; it is non-dual being devoid of otherness, and it cannot be an object of knowledge in the ordinary sense as it surpasses the intellect in subtleness. Knowledge is truth and truth is correspondence of an apprehension with its object. It is the intellect which moves within the sphere of duality resulting in delusion, wrong identification etc. ''Para Vidya'' is the intuitive level of ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidya]]'' that stems from a unity, and manifests as a vision, manifests as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India: History, Religion, Vision and Contribution to the World|author=Alexander P.

The vision of the [[Nirguna Brahman]] is gained through ''Para Vidya'', it is the highest of all knowledge. The method of self-realization involves '' [[Shravana (hearing)|sravana]] '', '' [[Manana (reflection)|manana]] '' and '' [[nididhyasana]] '', and not rituals. ''Para Vidya'' is ''samyagdarcanam'', the pure philosophic esoteric doctrine which teaches that [[Brahman]] is without attributes (''[[gunas]]''), without any distinction (''vicesha'') and without limitations (''[[upadhi]]s''), that it undefinable, alone and without a second. Reality is incapable of increase; it does not change into anything else. When the true identity becomes known then the existence of the transmigrating soul and of Brahman as the creator, both vanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=66,142,260,266|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nzdbNqXIxQkC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=para+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LTUGVYqTHceMuASWnIHwBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;


''Para Vidya'', concerned with Brahman, the highest reality and value, and the final terminus, cannot be conceived as an inquiry; all scientific and ethical inquiries are ''Apara Vidya'', nevertheless, the scientists engaged in such inquiries not only guide the selection of means to an end but also guide choice of the ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals|author=Rajendra Prasad|publisher=Concept Publishing|pages=66-71|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=para+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LTUGVYqTHceMuASWnIHwBg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Vedanta]] deals with the transition from ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'' to ''vidya'', that is, from the imagined life to the life of true perception. [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is ''avidya''. ''Vidya'' is ''tattvavidya'', the knowledge of reality as it is in itself. ''Apara Vidya'' is rooted in "''[[adhyasa]]''" and "ignorance", ''Para Vidya'' is transcendent of the ''Apara Vidya'' and aims at realizing Reality as it is and not as it appears, and it supplants and corrects conventional knowledge and conventional belief, both. [[Adi Shankara|Shankara’s]] concept of ''adhyasa'' involves the logical interpretation of the ''[[Vedic|vedic vakyas]]. He explains that all epistemic, practical and socio-cultural distinctions are based on the mis-identification of the self as non-self (''[[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]]'') and of the non-self as the self. ''Para Vidya'' is absolute knowledge. ''Avidya'' lapses into ''Apara vidya'', and again into ''Para Vidya''. ''Avidya'', ''Apara Vidya'' and ''Paravya'' are three fold phases of experience, the three transitions in knowledge of the transforming cognizer.

''Para Vidya'' is the knowledge of the Absolute whereas ''Apara Vidya'' is the knowledge of the world; the former has Reality as its content and possesses a unique quality of ultimacy which is singular and free from reason, senses, etc., but the latter has the phenomenal world as its content.

The aim of integral education is to integrate all dichotomies, to integrate the material and spiritual dimensions of the human personality; it does not recognize the description of ''vidya'' as ''Para Vidya'' (higher spiritual knowledge) and ''Apara Vidya'' (the knowledge of the senses and the surface mind) because the latter without the light and influence of the former is ''avidya'' or false knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Integral Education: Thought and Practical|author=R.N.Pani|publisher=APH Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-kypZUaP2CYC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=para+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YT4GVbutB9bmuQTk54GYDg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">In [[differential geometry]] and the study of [[Lie group]]s, a '''parabolic geometry''' is a [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''P'' which is the quotient of a [[semisimple Lie group]] ''G'' by a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P''.  More generally, the curved analogs of a parabolic geometry in this sense is also called a parabolic geometry: any geometry that is modeled on such a space by means of a [[Cartan connection]].

== Examples ==
The [[projective space]] ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an example.  It is the homogeneous space PGL(''n''+1)/''H'' where ''H'' is the isotropy group of a line.  In this geometrical space, the notion of a straight line is meaningful, but there is no preferred ("affine") parameter along the lines.  The curved analog of projective space is a manifold in which the notion of a [[geodesic]] makes sense, but for which there are no preferred parametrizations on those geodesics.  A [[projective connection]] is the relevant Cartan connection that gives a means for describing a projective geometry by gluing copies of the projective space to the tangent spaces of the base manifold.  Broadly speaking, [[projective geometry]] refers to the study of manifolds with this kind of connection.

Another example is the [[conformal geometry|conformal sphere]].  Topologically, it is the ''n''-sphere, but there is no notion of length defined on it, just of angle between curves.  Equivalently, this geometry is described as an equivalence class of [[Riemannian metric]]s on the sphere (called a conformal class).  The group of transformations that preserve angles on the sphere is the [[Lorentz group]] O(''n''+1,1), and so ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = O(''n''+1,1)/''P''.  [[Conformal geometry]] is, more broadly, the study of manifolds with a conformal equivalence class of Riemannian metrics, i.e., manifolds modeled on the conformal sphere.  Here the associated Cartan connection is the [[conformal connection]].

Other examples include:
* [[CR geometry]], the study of manifolds modeled on a real hyperquadric &lt;math&gt;Q^{2(p+q)-1} = SU(p,q)/P \subseteq \mathbb{C}^{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the stabilizer of an isotropic line (see [[CR manifold]])
* contact projective geometry, the study of manifolds modeled on &lt;math&gt;SP(n)/P&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is that subgroup of the [[symplectic group]] stabilizing the line generated by the first standard basis vector in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Patatap''' is a [[visual music|visual]] [[Drum kit|sound kit]] application with animations by computer programmer Jono Brandel and Japanese [[electronic music|electronic]] duo [[Lullatone]], consisting of Shawn James Seymour and Yoshimi Tomida.

==Summary==
''Patatap'' consists of unique [[color palette|palette]]s of colors, sounds, and shapes that are altered via the spacebar.&lt;ref name = "Fastcodesign"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jonobr1"&gt;[http://works.jonobr1.com/Patatap "Patatap"]. Jono Brandel Official Website. Retrieved December 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Acclaim"/&gt; The 26 melodic and rhythmic sounds that are in each set are triggered by pressing the A to Z keys.&lt;ref name = "Acclaim"&gt;[http://acclaimmag.com/art/patatap-make-trippy-synaesthetic-beats-keyboard/ "Patatap: Make trippy synaesthetic beats with your keyboard"]. ''Acclaim''. Retrieved December 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the sounds present a visual animation over the background when played.&lt;ref name = "Acclaim"/&gt; A writer for ''Co.design'' described the audio textures as ranging from "bells and snaps to pew-pewing lasers and alien spaceship landings."&lt;ref name = "Fastcodesign"/&gt;

==Development==
John Brandel had been experimenting with [[visual music|animations serving as visuals for music]] "over the last couple of years," he said in a 2014 interview.&lt;ref name = "Evolver"&gt;Van Buskirk, Eliot (April 7, 2014).

Retrieved December 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, he got in touch with the Japanese duo [[Lullatone]] who conceived of making a [[musical instrument]] application that was based on visualizing music.&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt; As Brandel described the intentions of making ''Patatap'', "we [were] interested in the mixing of aural and visual senses, and wanted to bring that to a format that anyone can enjoy."&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt;

In order to develop an instrument where a user with no musical abilities could create a song, Lullatone made sure all the sounds weren't "muddy if someone pressed too many buttons at once."&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt; The duo initially made a set consisting of more melodic notes than percussion hits, but they figured out that "too many melodic elements made it hard to create tracks with room to breathe."&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt; Thus, the final set of sounds consisted of an equal amount of thirteen melodic sounds and thirteen rhythmic sounds.&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt; As Lullatone's Shawn James Seymour explained, "We just chose sounds for each set that we thought would work well together to make a song with a few random dudes thrown it to give it some spice!"&lt;ref name = "Evolver"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
Before its official release, ''Patatap'' was featured at the Monarch bar in [[San Francisco]] in 2012 and Gray Area's Creative Code program in 2013.&lt;ref name = "Jonobr1"/&gt; Later on, Brandel and Lullatone presented the program at several conventions,&lt;ref name = "Jonobr1"/&gt; such as the eighteenth [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.j-mediaarts.jp/en/festival/2014/entertainment/works/18ej_patatap/ "Patatap"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40856">{{short description|axioms for the natural numbers}}
In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Peano axioms''', also known as the '''Dedekind–Peano axioms''' or the '''Peano postulates''', are [[axiom]]s for the [[natural number]]s presented by the 19th century [[Italian people|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Giuseppe Peano]]. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether [[number theory]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].

The need to formalize [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].{{sfn|Grassmann|1861}} In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peirce|1881}}, {{harvnb|Shields|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&amp;nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in&amp;nbsp;1889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, [[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita|''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'']] ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).

The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the "underlying logic".{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=94}} The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].

== Formulation ==

When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=2}} Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}

The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] '''N''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt; The [[non-logical symbol]]s for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.

The first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:
{{ordered list|start=1
| 1= 0 is a natural number.
}}
The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of "the Peano axioms" in modern treatments.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}
{{ordered list|start=2
| 2= For every natural number ''x'', {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].
| 3= For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].
| 4= For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''z''}}. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]].
| 5= For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''b'' is a natural number and {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}, then ''a'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality.
}}
The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued "[[successor function|successor]]" [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''.
{{ordered list|start=6
| 6=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number.
| 7=For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n'')}}. That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]].
| 8=For every natural number ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''S''(''n'') = 0}} is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0.
}}
Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the "first" natural number.{{sfn|Peano|1889|page=1}} This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a [[unary numeral system|unary representation]] of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0. Put differently, they do not guarantee that every natural number other than zero must succeed some other natural number.

The intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying ''successor'' sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''[[axiom of induction]]''.

{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''K'' is a set such that:
* 0 is in ''K'', and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''n'' being in ''K'' implies that ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'',
then ''K'' contains every natural number.
}}

The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:
{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''φ'' is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that:
* ''φ''(0) is true, and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''φ''(''n'') being true implies that ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
then ''φ''(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''.
}}

In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section {{section link||Models}} below.

== Arithmetic ==

The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on [[natural numbers#Notation|'''N''']]. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[set theory]] or [[second-order logic]], and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.

=== Addition ===

[[Addition in N|Addition]] is a function that [[map (mathematics)|maps]] two natural numbers (two elements of '''N''') to another one. It is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 0      &amp;= a ,        &amp; \textrm{(1)}\\
a + S (b)  &amp;= S (a + b). &amp; \textrm{(2)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 1 &amp;= a + S(0)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 0)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(a),        &amp; \mbox{using (1)} \\
\\
a + 2 &amp;= a + S(1)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 1)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(a))      &amp; \mbox{using } a + 1 = S(a) \\
\\
a + 3 &amp;= a + S(2)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 2)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(S(a)))    &amp; \mbox{using } a + 2 = S(S(a)) \\
\text{etc.} &amp; \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] with identity element 0. {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding '''N''' is the [[integer]]s.

=== Multiplication ===

Similarly, [[multiplication]] is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

a \cdot 0 &amp;= 0, \\
a \cdot S (b) &amp;= a + (a \cdot b).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy to see that ''S''(0) (or "1", in the familiar language of [[decimal representation]]) is the multiplicative [[identity element|right identity]]:

: ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''

To show that ''S''(0) is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:

* ''S''(0) is the left identity of 0: ''S''(0) · 0 = 0.
* If ''S''(0) is the left identity of ''a'' (that is ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''a''), then ''S''(0) is also the left identity of ''S''(''a''): ''S''(0) · ''S''(''a'') = ''S''(0) + ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''S''(0) + ''a'' = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a'').

Therefore by the induction axiom ''S''(0) is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers.  Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition:

: ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'').

Thus, {{nowrap|('''N''', +, 0, ·, ''S''(0))}} is a commutative [[semiring]].

=== Inequalities ===

The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:

: For all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if there exists some {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ '''N'''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''}}.

This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for &lt;math&gt; a, b, c \in \mathbf{N} &lt;/math&gt;, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, then:

* ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and
* ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''.

Thus, the structure {{nowrap|('''N''', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤)}} is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.

The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation "≤":

: For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''φ'', if
:* ''φ''(0) is true, and
:* for every {{nowrap|''n'', ''k'' ∈ '''N'''}}, if {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}} implies that ''φ''(''k'') is true, then ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
: then for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, ''φ''(''n'') is true.

This form of the induction axiom, called ''strong induction'', is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of '''N''' has a [[least element]]—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ '''N'''}} be given and assume ''X'' has no least element.

* Because 0 is the least element of '''N''', it must be that {{nowrap|0 ∉ ''X''}}.
* For any {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, suppose for every {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}, {{nowrap|''k'' ∉ ''X''}}. Then {{nowrap|''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X''}}, for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''.

Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''n'' ∉ ''X''}}. Thus, {{nowrap|1=''X'' ∩ '''N''' = ∅}}, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of '''N'''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.

== First-order theory of arithmetic ==

All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]].{{sfn|Partee|Ter Meulen|Wall|2012|page=215}} The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in [[second-order logic|second-order]], since it [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifies]] over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order ''[[axiom schema]]'' of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.{{sfnp|Harsanyi|1983}}

First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the [[successor function|successor operation]], but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the [[signature (logic)|signature]] of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.

The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], is sufficient for this purpose:{{sfn|Mendelson|1997|page=155}}

* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (0 \neq  S ( x ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (S( x ) =  S( y ) \Rightarrow x = y)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x  + 0 = x )&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x + S( y ) =  S( x + y ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot 0 = 0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot  S ( y ) = x \cdot y + x )&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula {{nowrap|''φ''(''x'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for ''φ'' is the sentence

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \bar{y} (\varphi(0,\bar{y}) \land \forall x ( \varphi(x,\bar{y})\Rightarrow\varphi(S(x),\bar{y})) \Rightarrow \forall x \varphi(x,\bar{y}))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{y}&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula ''φ''.

=== Equivalent axiomatizations ===

There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=16–18}}

&lt;!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't "tweak" them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[associative property|associative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + y = y + x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[commutative property|commutative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is associative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot y = y \cdot x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is commutative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication [[distributive property|distributes]] over addition.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + 0 = x \land x \cdot 0 = 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., zero is an [[identity element|identity]] for addition, and an [[absorbing element]] for multiplication (actually superfluous&lt;ref group=note&gt;"&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 0 = 0 ) &lt;/math&gt;" can be proven from the other axioms (in first-order logic) as follows. Firstly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 = x \cdot (0+0) = x \cdot 0 = x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by distributivity and additive identity. Secondly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 \lor x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; by Axiom 15. If &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by addition of the same element and commutativity, and hence &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by substitution, contradicting irreflexivity. Therefore it must be that &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;).
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 1 = x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., one is an [[identity element|identity]] for multiplication.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \land y &lt; z \Rightarrow x &lt; z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( \neg (x &lt; x) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \lor x = y \lor y &lt; x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the ordering satisfies [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow x + z &lt; y + z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under addition of the same element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( 0 &lt; z \land x &lt; y \Rightarrow x \cdot z &lt; y \cdot z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under multiplication by the same positive element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow \exists z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + z = y ) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given any two distinct elements, the larger is the smaller plus another element.
# &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; 1 \land \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &gt; 0 \Rightarrow x \ge 1 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero and one are distinct and there is no element between them.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \ge 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero is the minimum element.

The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'''; the theory '''PA''' is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema. An important property of PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is that any structure &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;) isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Elements in that segment are called '''standard''' elements, while other elements are called '''nonstandard''' elements.

== Models ==

A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}}, where '''N''' is a (necessarily infinite) set, {{nowrap|0 ∈ '''N'''}} and {{nowrap|''S'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''The Nature and Meaning of Numbers'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?}}, i.e., “What are the numbers and what are they good for?”) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; → '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

f(0_A) &amp;= 0_B \\
f(S_A (n)) &amp;= S_B (f (n))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.

=== Set-theoretic models ===
{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}
The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suppes|1960}}, {{harvnb|Hatcher|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;s(a) = a \cup \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;

The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

0 &amp;= \emptyset \\
1 &amp;= s(0) = s(\emptyset) = \emptyset \cup \{ \emptyset \} = \{ \emptyset \} = \{ 0 \} \\
2 &amp;= s(1) = s(\{ 0 \}) = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0 , \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0, 1 \} \\
3 &amp;= s(2) = s(\{ 0, 1 \}) = \{ 0, 1 \} \cup \{ \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the [[successor function]] {{nowrap|''s'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the Peano axioms.

Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.{{sfn|Tarski|Givant|1987|loc=Section 7.6}} One such system is ZFC with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.

=== Interpretation in category theory ===

The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]]. Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define the category of [[pointed unary system]]s, US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') as follows:

* The objects of US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') are triples {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and {{nowrap|0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''X''}} are ''C''-morphisms.
* A morphism ''φ'' : (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''Y'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} with {{nowrap|1=''φ'' 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''φ'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''φ''}}.

Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}} is this initial object, and {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is any other object, then the unique map {{nowrap|''u'' : ('''N''', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is such that

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

u 0 &amp;= 0_X, \\
u (S x) &amp;= S_X (u x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This is precisely the recursive definition of 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Nonstandard models ==

Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called "[[non-standard model]]s"); the [[compactness theorem]] implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.4.3|ps=, presenting a theorem of [[Thoralf Skolem]]}} The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.3.1}} This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.

When interpreted as a proof within a first-order [[set theory]], such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.

It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as [[Skolem]] in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].{{sfn|Kaye|1991|loc=Section 11.3}} This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible [[order type]] of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ''ω'' be the order type of the natural numbers, ''ζ'' be the order type of the integers, and ''η'' be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is {{nowrap|''ω'' + ''ζ''·''η''}}, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.

=== Overspill ===

A '''cut''' in a nonstandard model ''M'' is a nonempty subset ''I'' of ''M'' so that ''I'' is downward closed ( ''x''&lt;''y'' and ''y''&amp;isin;''I'' implies ''x''&amp;isin;''I'') and ''I'' is closed under successor. A '''proper cut''' is a cut that is a proper subset of ''M''. Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers.   However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable.  The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact. 

:'''Overspill Lemma'''{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=70ff.}} Let ''M'' be a nonstandard model of PA and let ''I'' be a proper cut of ''M''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\bar a&lt;/math&gt; is a tuple of elements of ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in the language of arithmetic so that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(b, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''b''&amp;isin;''I''.
:Then there is a ''c'' in ''M'' that is greater than every element of ''I'' such that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(c, \bar a).&lt;/math&gt;

== Consistency ==
{{Further|Hilbert's second problem|Consistency}}

When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a "natural number".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fritz|1952|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Yl_XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137, p. 137]}}&lt;br&gt;An illustration of 'interpretation' is Russell's own definition of 'cardinal number'. The uninterpreted system in this case is Peano's axioms for the number system, whose three primitive ideas and five axioms, Peano believed, were sufficient to enable one to derive all the properties of the system of natural numbers. Actually, Russell maintains, Peano's axioms define any progression of the form &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of which the series of the natural numbers is one instance.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|2013|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=w2Tya9gOKqEC&amp;pg=PA133 p. 133]}}&lt;br&gt;So Poincaré turned to see whether logicism could generate arithmetic, more precisely, the arithmetic of ordinals. Couturat, said Poincaré, had accepted the Peano axioms as a definition of a number. But this will not do. The axioms cannot be shown to be free of contradiction by finding examples of them, and any attempt to show that they were contradiction-free by examining the totality of their implications would require the very principle of mathematical induction Couturat believed they implied. For (in a further passage dropped from S&amp;M) either one assumed the principle in order to prove it, which would only prove that if it is true it is not self-contradictory, which says nothing; or one used the principle in another form than the one stated, in which case one must show that the number of steps in one's reasoning was an integer according to the new definition, but this could not be done (1905c, 834).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].{{sfn|Hilbert|1902}} In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.{{sfn|Gödel|1931}}

Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentzen explained: "The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.

The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate [[ultrafinitism]], reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are [[self-verifying theories]] that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of "0=1").{{sfn|Willard|2001}}

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">{{Redirect|Product space||The Product Space}}
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''product space''' is the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of [[topological space]]s equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the '''product topology'''.  This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the [[box topology]], which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces.  However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a [[product (category theory)|categorical product]] of its factors, whereas the box topology is [[Comparison of topologies|too fine]]; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural".

==Definition==
Given ''X'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i \in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;

is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[index set|indexed]] by &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where each ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is open in ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for only finitely many ''i''. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the set of all Cartesian products between one basis elements from each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for a finite product, the set of all &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the (chosen) basis of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, is a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The product topology on ''X'' is the topology generated by sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), where  ''i'' is in ''I ''  and ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an open subset of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In other words, the sets {''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')} form a [[subbase]] for the topology on ''X''. A [[subset]] of ''X'' is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]] of finitely many sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''). The ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are sometimes called [[open cylinder]]s, and their intersections are [[cylinder set]]s.

In general, the product of the topologies of each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' forms a basis for what is called the [[box topology]] on ''X''. In general, the box topology is [[finer topology|finer]] than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.

== Examples ==

If one starts with the [[standard topology]] on the [[real line]] '''R''' and defines a topology on the product of ''n'' copies of '''R''' in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary [[Euclidean topology]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[Cantor set]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the product of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the [[discrete space]] {0,1} and the space of [[irrational number]]s is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the [[natural number]]s, where again each copy carries the discrete topology.

Several additional examples are given in the article on the [[initial topology]].

== Properties ==

The product space ''X'', together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following [[universal property]]: If ''Y'' is a topological space, and for every ''i'' in ''I'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a continuous map, then there exists ''precisely one'' continuous map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' such that for each ''i'' in ''I'' the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[Image:CategoricalProduct-02.png|center|Characteristic property of product spaces]]
This shows that the product space is a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. It follows from the above universal property that a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous [[if and only if]] ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' o ''f'' is continuous for all ''i'' in ''I''. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous. Checking whether a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous in some way.

In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[open map]]s. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The converse is not true: if ''W'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of the product space whose projections down to all the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are open, then ''W'' need not be open in ''X''. (Consider for instance ''W'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; \ (0,1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) The canonical projections are not generally [[closed map]]s (consider for example the closed set &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid xy = 1\},&lt;/math&gt; whose projections onto both axes are '''R''' \ {0}).

The product topology is also called the ''topology of pointwise convergence'' because of the following fact: a [[sequence]] (or [[Net (mathematics)|net]]) in ''X'' converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; converge. In particular, if one considers the space ''X'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[real number|real]] valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s on ''I'', convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.

Any product of closed subsets of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a closed set in ''X''.

An important theorem about the product topology is [[Tychonoff's theorem]]: any product of [[compact space]]s is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

== Relation to other topological notions ==
* Separation
** Every product of [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[Hausdorff space]]s is Hausdorff&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=4317|title=Product topology preserves the Hausdorff property}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Every product of [[regular space]]s is regular
** Every product of [[Tychonoff space]]s is Tychonoff
** A product of [[normal space]]s ''need not'' be normal
* Compactness
** Every product of compact spaces is compact ([[Tychonoff's theorem]])
** A product of [[locally compact space]]s ''need not'' be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact ''is'' locally compact (This condition is sufficient and necessary). 
* Connectedness
** Every product of [[connectedness|connected]] (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected)
** Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.
* Metric spaces
** Countable products of [[metric space]]s are [[metric space|metrizable]]

==Axiom of choice==
The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.

The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, [[Tychonoff's theorem]] on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

{{redirect|Selves}}
The '''self''' is an individual person as the object of his or her own reflective consciousness. This reference is necessarily subjective, thus ''self'' is a reference by a subject to the same subject. The sense of having a self&amp;nbsp;– or self-hood&amp;nbsp;– should, however, not be confused with [[subjectivity]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Zahavi, D. (2005). ''Subjectivity and selfhood: Investigating the first-person perspective.'' New York: MIT.&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly, there is a directedness outward from the subject that refers inward, back to its "self" (or itself). Examples of psychiatric conditions where such 'sameness' is broken include [[depersonalization]], which sometimes occur in [[schizophrenia]]: the self appears different to the subject.

The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from [[personal identity]]. Whereas "identity" is sameness,&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, D. (Dec 15, 2015) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/#ConAcc "Personal Identity and Ethics", section "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2016 Edition), ed. Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; self-hood implies a first-person perspective. Conversely, we use "person" as a third-person reference. Personal identity can be impaired in late stage [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases. Finally, the self is distinguishable from "others". Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Studies in Otherness. Otherness: Essays and studies. 4.1. http://www.otherness.dk/journal/otherness-essays-studies-41/&lt;/ref&gt;) and contemporary [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] (see also [[Phenomenology (psychology)|psychological phenomenology]]), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience.

Although [[subjective experience]] is central to self-hood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the philosophical and scientific study of [[consciousness]].

==Neuroscience==
The [[Insular cortex|insula]] is an area in the brain, which is located below the [[neocortex|neocortical]] surface of the [[brain]], in the [[allocortex]]. It appears to be involved in self-reference (see [[insular cortex|insula]]). In addition, [[mirror neurons]] are neurons that fire both during the self performing a task and when watching someone else (other) executing the same task.

==Philosophy==
{{main article|Philosophy of self}}

The philosophy of self seeks to describe essential qualities that constitute a person's uniqueness or essential being. There have been various approaches to defining these qualities. The self can be considered that being which is the source of consciousness, the [[moral agency|agent]] [[Moral responsibility|responsible]] for an individual's thoughts and actions, or the [[Substance theory|substantial]] nature of a person which endures and unifies consciousness over time.

In addition to [[Emmanuel Levinas]] writings on "otherness", the distinction between "you" and "me" has been further elaborated in [[Martin Buber]]'s philosophical work: Du und Ich.

==Psychology==
{{main article|Psychology of self}}

The psychology of self is the study of either the [[cognitive]] and [[affective]] representation of one's identity or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology forms the distinction between the self as ''I'', the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the subject that is known.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1890)&lt;/ref&gt;  Current views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C. &amp; Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Self following from [[John Locke]] has been seen as a product of [[episodic memory]]&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10789197 | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=The construction of autobiographical memories in the self-memory system | date=April 2000 | journal=Psychol Rev | pages=261–88 | last1 = Conway | first1 = MA | last2 = Pleydell-Pearce | first2 = CW}}&lt;/ref&gt; but research upon those with [[amnesia]] find they have a coherent sense of self based upon preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rathbone"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19382038 | doi=10.1080/13554790902849164 | volume=15 | issue=5 | title=Autobiographical memory and amnesia: using conceptual knowledge to ground the self | date=October 2009 | journal=Neurocase | pages=405–18 | last1 = Rathbone | first1 = CJ | last2 = Moulin | first2 = CJ | last3 = Conway | first3 = MA| url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/21635/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly possible to correlate cognitive and affective experience of self with neural processes.  A goal of this ongoing research is to provide grounding and insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of human identity are composed. The 'Disorders of the Self' have also been extensively studied by psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G.E. &amp; Marková I.S. (2003) The self in psychiatry: a conceptual history. In Kircher T &amp; David A. (eds) ''The Self in Neurosciences and Psychiatry''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pp9-39&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, facial and pattern recognition take large amounts of brain processing capacity but pareidolia cannot explain many constructs of self for cases of disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder.

One's sense of self can be changed upon becoming part of a stigmatized group. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), if an individual has prejudice against a certain group, like the elderly and then later becomes part of this group this prejudice can be turned inward causing depression (i.e. deprejudice).&lt;ref
name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–449 |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url= http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate= |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of a disordered self, such as in [[schizophrenia]], is described in terms of what the psychiatrist understands are actual events in terms of neuron excitation but are delusions nonetheless, and the schizo-affective or schizophrenic person also believes are actual events in terms of essential being. PET scans have shown that auditory stimulation is processed in certain areas of the brain, and imagined similar events are processed in adjacent areas, but hallucinations are processed in the same areas as actual stimulation. In such cases, external influences may be the source of consciousness and the person may or may not be responsible for "sharing" in the mind's process, or the events which occur, such as visions and auditory stimuli, may persist and be repeated often over hours, days, months or years—and the afflicted person may believe themselves to be in a state of rapture or possession.

What the Freudian tradition has subjectively called, "sense of self" is for Jungian analytic psychology, where one's identity is lodged in the persona or ego and is subject to change in maturation. [[Carl Jung]] distinguished, "The self is not only the center, but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the center of this totality...".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl. CW 12, ¶44&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Self in Jungian Psychology]] is "the archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche;… a transpersonal power that transcends the ego." &lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl. (1951) CW 9ii, The Self. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Daryl (1991). Jung Lexicon: A Primer of Terms &amp; Concepts. Inner City Books. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; As an archetype,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jungian Archetypes]]&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be seen directly, but by ongoing individuating maturation and analytic observation, can be experienced objectively by its cohesive wholeness making factor.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Emma &amp; von Franz, Marie-Louise. (1998). The Grail Legend, Princeton University Press. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{main article|Religious views on the self}}

Religious views on the self vary widely. The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of [[spirituality]]. Two types of self are commonly considered - the self that is the [[ego (spirituality)|ego]], also called the learned, superficial self of mind and body, an egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the "True Self", the "Observing Self", or the "Witness".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Manly P. ''Self Unfoldment by Disciplines of Realization''. Los Angeles, California: The Philosophical Research Society, Inc. 1942. page 115 "On rare occasions we glimpse for an instant the tremendous implication of the Self, and we become aware that the personality is indeed merely a shadow of the real."&lt;/ref&gt;

One description of spirituality is the self's search for "ultimate meaning" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Another definition of spiritual identity is: "A persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual value of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined by one's life and experiences."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Human beings have a self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Charon, Joel M. ''Ten Questions: A Sociological Perspective.'' 5th edition. Thomson &amp; Wadsworth. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions such as [[Buddhism]] see the [[Raga (Buddhism)|attachment]] to [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] is an illusion that serves as the main cause of [[Dukkha|suffering]] and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerr.com/galin/papers/roots.htm|title=The concept "self" and "person" in buddhism and in western psychology|publisher=NY:Columbia University Press|date=2001|accessdate=2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904105541/http://www.rogerr.com/galin/papers/roots.htm|archive-date=2017-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] makes a distinction between the true self and the false self, and sees the false self negatively, distorted through [[sin]]: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' ([[Jeremiah]] 17:9)

According to [[Marcia Cavell]],{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} identity comes from both political and religious views. He also identified exploration and commitment as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. [[Erik Erikson]] compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kiesling, Chris; Montgomery, Marylin; Sorell, Gwendolyn; Colwell, Ronald. "Identity and Spirituality: A Psychosocial Exploration of the Sense of Spiritual Self"&lt;/ref&gt;
In Advaita Vedanta of Hinduism it is said that we are not the body but the self(soul). Everything is temporary in this universe only self is permanent. Self is the subject, self is the witness of the world. And it is said that self realisation is the true goal of human life. It is salvation. This is God realisation.

==Culture==
{{Confusing section|reason=unclear and ungrammatical English, for example "Self-concept can be referred to as a product..."|date=December 2017}}
The self is constantly evolving due to the complexities of cultures and societies. Researchers have shown that the self is dependent on the culture that the self has been situated in.  Several comparisons between western cultures versus eastern cultures show that there are cultural differences among the self and self-concept. The self can be redefined as a dynamic, responsive process that structures neural pathways according to past and present environments including material, social, and spiritual aspects (Self, Culture, &amp; Society Class, 2015). Self-concept can be referred to as a product instead of a process like the self is represented as. Self-concept is a concept or belief that an individual has upon him/herself as an emotional, spiritual, and social being (Aronson, 2002). Therefore, the self-concept is the idea of who I am, kind of like a self-reflection of one’s well being. For example, the self-concept is anything you say about yourself. A society is a group of people who share a common belief or aspect of Self interacting toward the maintenance or betterment of the collective (Self, Culture, &amp; Society Class, 2015). Culture consists of explicit and implicit patterns of historically derived and selected ideas and their embodiment in institutions, cognitive and social practices, and artifacts.  Cultural systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, and on the other, as conditioning elements of further action (Kroeber &amp; Kluckholn, 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;357). Therefore, the following sections will explore how the self and self-concept can be changed due to different cultures.

As children, teenagers, and young adults grow up society tells these individuals to “Be yourself”. But this may mean something completely different for individuals who live in different cultures. The way individuals construct themselves may be different due to their culture (Kanagawa, 2001). A western culture self is usually seen as abstract, private, individual, and separates themselves from the rest of the group. Whereas an eastern culture self might be presented as open and flexible (Kanagawa, 2001). The self relies on the environment and culture it is put in. The self evolves and is constantly changing to the environment so that it is not threatened. Therefore, researchers wanted to study the differences between cultures and see if individual’s conceptual selves change due to their culture and environment.

Researchers Kanagawa and Heine have studied participants who lived in western and eastern cultures. Throughout the study the researchers concluded that western cultures such as North American and West European cultures are more independent cultures (Heine &amp; Lehman,1992). The individuals in the western society tend to look only for positive attributes and strive for goals that will put them ahead of others. Western cultures are more goal oriented for individualism, instead of being more collective for the group to advance ahead. This is due to the culture that westerners instill, the whole culture concept is to out beat another individual to advance their own well being (Kanagawa, 2001). The independent cultures create selves and self-concepts to worry about their own individual thoughts and feelings (Heine &amp; Lehman,1992). Whereas eastern cultures such as those of Japan, Asian, Africa, Latin American, and South Europe are interdependent cultures (Heine &amp; Lehman,1992). The culture is very different in eastern cultures because their culture is based on the collective, instead of focusing on one individual. For instance, Japanese culture focuses heavily on self-criticism and trying to improve themselves to become better individuals (Kanagawa, 2001). They really depend on negative feedback and aspects of themselves so that they can advance and help the entire culture and society. The whole goal is to maintain harmony and balance within society (Kanagawa, 2001). Therefore, Japan’s conceptual self is very different to western culture due to the environment and standards that each culture upholds. Eastern cultures are represented as interdependent because they only think and feel for others instead of thinking about themselves (Heine &amp; Lehman, 1992). In addition, the studies that these researchers have conducted show an important relationship between the self and how cultures can play a major role in shaping the self and self-concept. 
      
Furthermore, the self is shaped by our social interactions and our physical environments. An individual's social interactions occur when they’re in a specific society or culture. If these individuals grow up in a certain culture they’re going to conform to societal norms and pressures to follow a specific standard that their culture believes in. This is why culture is important to study and explore when searching how the self evolves and changes. To conclude, western cultures are more self-absorbed in their own lives whereas eastern cultures are less self-absorbed because they cherish the collective (SOURCE?). The self is dynamic and complex and it will change or conform to whatever social influence it is exposed to. The main reason why the self is constantly dynamic is because it always looks for reasons to not be harmed. The self in any culture looks out for its well being and will avoid as much threat as possible. This can be explained through the evolutionary psychology concept called [[survival of the fittest]].

Historical models of sexual identity have tended to view its formation as a process undergone only by [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], while more contemporary models view the process as far more universal and attempt to present sexual identity within the larger scope of other major identity theories and processes.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"&gt;Dillon, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2), (pp.649-670). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and identity ==
Sexual identity has been described as a component of an individual's identity that reflects their sexual self-concept. The integration of the respective identity components (e.g. moral, religious, ethnic, occupational) into a greater overall identity is essential to the process of developing the multi-dimensional construct of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Luyckx, K., Schwartz, S. J., Goossens, L., Beyers, W., &amp; Missotten, L. (2011). Processes of personal identity formation and evaluation. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.77-98). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 {{ISBN|9780981450513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concordance/discordance in SO"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael W.

In a 1990 study by the Social Organization of Sexuality, only 16% of women and 36% of men who reported some level of [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]] had a homosexual or bisexual identity.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States|last=Laumann|first=Edward O.|year=1994|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72AHO0rE2HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=the+social+organization+of+sexuality+1990&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kHfFtQQH7j&amp;sig=ZS5sk4GqzcR4e8mLVIHTNPsHt-Y#PPA299,M1|pages=298–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity is more closely related to sexual behavior than sexual orientation is. The same survey found that 96% of women and 87% of men with a homosexual or bisexual identity had engaged in sexual activity with someone of the same sex, contrasted to 32% of women and 43% of men who had same-sex attractions. Upon reviewing the results, the organization commented: "Development of self-identification as homosexual or gay is a psychological and socially complex state, something which, in this society, is achieved only over time, often with considerable personal struggle and self-doubt, not to mention social discomfort."&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

===Unlabeled sexuality===
Unlabeled sexuality is when an individual chooses to not label their sexual identity. This identification could stem from one's uncertainty about their sexuality or their unwillingness to conform to a sexuality because they don't necessarily like labels, or they wish to feel free in their attractions instead of feeling forced into same, other, both, or pan attractions because of their sexual identity. Identifying as unlabeled could also be because of one's "unwillingness to accept their sexual minority status."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Lisa M | year = 2007 | title = A dynamical systems approach to the development and expression of female same-sex sexuality | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 142–161 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because being unlabeled is the purposeful decision of no sexual identity, it is different from bisexuality or any other sexual identity. Those who are unlabeled are more likely to view sexuality as less stable and more fluid and tend to focus more on the “person, not the gender.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooks | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Quina | first2 = Kathryn | year = 2009 | title = Women's sexual identity patterns: Differences among lesbians, bisexuals, and unlabeled women | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 8| pages = 1030–1045 | doi=10.1080/00918360903275443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
It is reported that some women who identify as unlabeled did so because they are unable or uncertain about the types of relationships they will have in the future. As such, this divergence from sexual labels could provide for a person to be able to more fully realize their "true" sexuality because it frees them from the pressure of liking and being attracted to who their sexual identification dictates they should like.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Development==
{{See also|Coming out|Homosexuality and psychology}}

===General===
Most of the research on sexual orientation identity development focuses on the development of people who are attracted to the same sex. Many people who feel attracted to members of their own sex [[coming out|come out]] at some point in their lives. ''Coming out'' is described in three phases. The first phase is the phase of "knowing oneself," and the realization emerges that one is sexually and emotionally attracted to members of one's own sex. This is often described as an internal coming out and can occur in childhood or at puberty, but sometimes as late as age 40 or older. The second phase involves a decision to come out to others, e.g. family, friends, and/or colleagues, while the third phase involves living openly as an [[LGBT]] person.&lt;ref name="hrccontinuum"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-05-04 |url=http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |periodical=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |title=The Coming Out Continuum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101657/http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |archivedate=2007-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States today, people often come out during high school or college age. At this age, they may not trust or ask for help from others, especially when their orientation is not accepted in society. Sometimes they do not inform their own families.

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity" and "[r]ather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."/&gt;

Some individuals with [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation|unwanted sexual attractions]] may choose to actively dis-identify with a sexual minority identity, which creates a different sexual orientation identity from their actual sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation identity, but not sexual orientation, can change through [[psychotherapy]], [[support group]]s, and life events.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;  A person who has homosexual feelings can self-identify in various ways.  An individual may come to accept an LGB identity, to develop a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] identity, to reject an LGB identity while choosing to identify as [[ex-gay]], or to refrain from specifying a sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation], pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' article on reconciling faith and homosexuality, researcher Judith Glassgold, who chaired the task force, stated, "We're not trying to encourage people to become ''ex-gay''’" and "there has been little research on the long-term effects of rejecting a gay identity, but there is 'no clear evidence of harm' and 'some people seem to be content with that path'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124950491516608883 A New Therapy on Faith and Sexual Identity: Psychological Association Revises Treatment Guidelines to Allow Counselors to Help Clients Reject Their Same-Sex Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models of sexual identity development===
Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development (e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989). These historical models have taken a view of sexual identity formation as a sexual-minority process only.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2011) Identity development among sexual-minority youth. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.671-689). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2005). The new gay teenager. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More contemporary models take the stance that it is a more universal process.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = E. M. | year = 2012 | title = Not always a straight path: College students' narratives of heterosexual identity development | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 66 | issue = 1–2| pages = 79–93 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-0068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current models for the development of sexual identity attempt to incorporate other models of identity development, such as Marcia’s ego-identity statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Navarro | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Savoy | first3 = H. B. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = D. | year = 2008 | title = Development, reliability, and validity of the measure of sexual identity exploration and commitment (MOSIEC) | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.22 | pmid=18194002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cass identity model]], established by Vivienne Cass, outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: (1) identity confusion, (2) identity comparison, (3) identity tolerance, (4) identity acceptance, (5) identity pride, and (6) identity synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cass | first1 = V. C. | year = 1979 | title = Homosexuality identity formation: A theoretical model | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 219–235 | doi=10.1300/j082v04n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fassinger's model of gay and lesbian identity development]] contains four stages at the individual and group level: (1) awareness, (2) exploration, (3) deepening/commitment, and (4) internalization/synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fassinger | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Miller | first2 = B. A. | year = 1997 | title = Validation of an Inclusive Modelof Sexual Minority Identity Formation on a Sample of Gay Men | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models of sexual identity development do not use discrete, ordered stages, but instead conceptualize identity development as consisting of independent identity processes. For example, D'Augelli's model describes six unordered independent identity processes: (1) exiting heterosexual identity, (2) Developing personal LGB identity status, (3) Developing a LGB social identity, (4) Becoming a LGB offspring, (5) Developing a LGB intimacy status, and (6) Entering a LGB community.&lt;ref&gt;D'Augelli, A. R. (1994). Identity development and sexual orientation: Toward a model of lesbian, gay, and bisexual development.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unifying Model of Sexual Identity Development is currently the only model that incorporates heterosexual identity development within its statuses to include compulsory heterosexuality, active exploration, diffusion, deepening and commitment to status, and synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds.), Handbook of identity theory and research (pp. 649-670). New York: Springer. &lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary models view sexual identity formation as a universal process, rather than a sexual minority one, in that it is not only sexual minorities that undergo sexual identity development, but heterosexual populations as well.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670" /&gt; More recent research has supported these theories, having demonstrated that heterosexual populations display all of Marcia’s statuses within the domain of sexual identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">'''Cho Kiyoko''' (June 20, 1917 – April 12, 2018), better known as '''Takeda Kiyoko''', was a Japanese scholar of the history of ideas. In the 1950s she contributed to the people-to-people diplomacy that was hurt by the World War II, aimed at restoring human relations and understanding among Asian people, including Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and other Asian countries. She was the founder for the Social Studies Institute at the [[International Christian University]] (ICU) in Tokyo, Takeda Kiyoko was a professor emerita at ICU with a PhD in Literature from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1961.

==Biography==
Takeda Kiyoko was born in Hyogo Prefecture, and after graduating from the Department of English Studies at the [[Kobe College]], she went to the United States in 1939 and studied at [[Olivet College]] as an exchange student. When she finished Olivet, she extended her study abroad at [[Columbia University]] for two years,&lt;ref name="uofo"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=70–92|title=Takeda Kiyoko: A Twentieth-century Japanese Christian intellectual|last= Ward|first=Vanessa B.|work=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies |volume=10|number=2|url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-Dec08/5_Ward_4.pdf|publisher=University of Otago|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uofo"/&gt; transferred to [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]] Graduate School. Takeda's chance to move from Olivet University in Michigan to New York was that her teaching adviser M. Holmes Hartshorne, a scholar and translator for works by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kierkegaard, godly deceiver : the nature and meaning of his pseudonymous writings|last=Hartshorne|first=M.

It is noteworthy that Takeda met both Niebuhr and [[Paul Tillich|Paul Johannes Tillich]] while studying in the US and became a scholar of Christian Ethics, Religious Phylosophy and History of Ideas.At the first World Conference of Christian Youth held in Amsterdam, Takeda had joined the Japanese delegate, when she met the lecturer Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr.&lt;ref name=hitobito/&gt;}} Takeda was one of those students who were deported to Japan on a Swedish vessel on personnel exchange treaty.&lt;ref name=uofo/&gt;

==Coming back to Japan==
During the World War II in Japan, Takeda tried to communicate with the military officers in charge of a factory she was a chaperon, how those Japanese high school and college students volunteer at the facilities were malnourished, by presenting the data of their weight she had listed.&lt;ref name=sugino1&gt;{{cite journal|language=ja|title=Joshi daigakusei no taikei ni tsuite no chosa|trans-title=The survey of university students and their physical being| author1=Takeda Kiyoko|author2=Mitsuuchi Mikiko|journal =Journal of Sugino Junior College|pages=1–15|number=23|issn=0286-2778|oclc=5171987012|year=1986|ref=harf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sugino2&gt;{{cite journal|language=ja|title=Joshi daigakusei no taikei ni tsuite no chosa |volume=2|trans-title=The survey of university students and their physical being| author1=Takeda Kiyoko|author2=Mitsuuchi Mikiko|journal =Journal of Sugino Junior College|pages=1–12|number=24|issn=0286-2778|oclc=5171987168|year=1987|ref=harf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although students nicknamed her after a fable character "Urashima Taro" or a person completely lost coming back from abroad. While pretending to obey the military official and national propaganda that Japan would win the War, Takeda found relief to know that those students disbelieved in the propaganda or they whispered among them the signs of defeat.&lt;ref name=nhk1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/postwar/program/past/|series=戦後史証言プロジェクト : 日本人は何をめざしてきたのか （２０１４年度「知の巨人たち」ひとびとの哲学を見つめて～鶴見俊輔と「思想の科学」～３）|title=貝殻型の人間像|author=Takeda Kiyoko|date=2014-05-16|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war activities==
It was during the Christian Youth Convention in Amsterdam in 1939 which she joined as an undergraduate at the Kobe College, and she started her thought about Japan and her relationship to other countries with lasting impact that she was unwelcome as a young woman coming from Japan. As she tried to acquaint with a Chinese woman student who lead the student protest activities in China, that person replied Takeda needed to persuade the Japanese forces to leave her nation before becoming a friend of hers.&lt;ref name=nikkeki&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO89376990W5A710C1000000/|title=思想史学者・武田清子氏「違う文化尊重を」（戦争と私）|author=社会部、山本有洋|work=戦後70年インタビュー|language=ja|trans-title=To respect different culture (Me and the War)|series=Interviews on the 70th year Post-war|publisher=[[The Nikkei]]|date=2015-07-31|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Japan surrendered, she published ''Shisō no Kagaku'' with [[Shunsuke Tsurumi|Tsurumi Shunsuke]] and his sister Kazuko along with [[Masao Maruyama (scholar)|Maruyama Masao]].&lt;ref name=nhk2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/postwar/program/past/|series=戦後史証言プロジェクト : 日本人は何をめざしてきたのか (２０１４年度「知の巨人たち」ひとびとの哲学を見つめて～鶴見俊輔と「思想の科学」1)|title=雑誌「思想の科学」創刊|author=Takeda Kiyoko|date=2014-05-16|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shisō no kagaku'' was among numerous magazines popped up post-war period, when common people wanted to express themselves. It was unique as it accepted essays from anybody with no discrimination on the authors' academic or sociological background, not limited to politically active students, and printed them on their pages pieces written by nurses, teachers, or social workers for poor factory areas in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=nhk3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/postwar/program/past/|series=戦後史証言プロジェクト : 日本人は何をめざしてきたのか (２０１４年度「知の巨人たち」ひとびとの哲学を見つめて～鶴見俊輔と「思想の科学」～5)|title=日本の地下水|trans-title=Groundwater of Japan|author=Takeda Kiyoko|date=2014-05-16|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takeda appreciates the trend in the late 1940s to early 1950s in Japanese philosophy that people sought to find their own policy, or defined it as "common men's philosophy " (hitobito no tetsugaku).&lt;ref name=nhk3/&gt;
To realize world peace after World War II, Takeda started to analyze politics and international relations from the viewpoint of ideological history, and on the other hand, she showed an example of &lt;private diplomacy&gt; or emphasized people-to-people trust among Asian including Japanese and Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and others. She confirmed with herself at the 3rd World Conference of Christian Youth held in India in December 1952.&lt;ref name=nhk3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takeda had an interview with Prime Minister Neal of India in Tokyo through Christian connections.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1953 Takeda started teaching as an associate professor at International Christian University researching to review the historic relationship between Japan and Asia, and led a community that evolved to the Asian Culture Research Institute in 1971.&lt;ref name=40anniversary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subsite.icu.ac.jp/research/iacs/1998-2008/#link2|title=Ajia bunka kenkyujo 40-shunen kinen kokusai shinpojiumu|trans-title=the symposium for the 40th anniversary of ICU Institute of Asian Cultural Studies|author=Cho (Takeda) Kiyoko, first president of ICU Institute of Asian Cultural Studies, Professor Emeritus at ICU |date=1998-12-24|publisher=ICU Institute for Asian Studies|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takeda received a PhD of Literature from the University of Tokyo in 1961 with her book "Ningenkan no sōkōku : kindai Nihon no shisō to Kirisutokyō" (1967).&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16822">'''True self''' (also known as '''real self''', '''authentic self''', '''original self''' and '''vulnerable self''') and '''false self''' (also known as '''fake self''', '''idealized self''', '''superficial self''' and '''pseudo self''') are psychological concepts often used in connection with [[narcissism]]. 

The concepts were introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] in 1960 by [[Donald Winnicott]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ego distortion in terms of true and false self|last = Winnicott|first = D. W.|date = 1965|journal = The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 140–57|publisher = International Universities Press, Inc|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience, and a feeling of being alive, having a real self.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feelings'' (London 2009) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – one which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists need to [[Abusive power and control|control]] others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]], seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Winnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of [[reality]], a sense that life is worth living.  The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that [[instinct]]ual sense,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and false self ', in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment'' (London 1965) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self.

However, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect!&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grolnick, ''The Work &amp; Play of Winnicott''  (New Jersey: Aronson 1990) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; – was ''not'' in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where "Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being".&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  The danger he saw was that "through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real",&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"/&gt;

==Precursors==
There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. [[Helene Deutsch]] had described the "as if" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott's analyst, [[Joan Riviere]], had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]'s own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; came close to viewing it only as a false self;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''Winnicott'' (Harvard 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to [[Michael Balint]]'s "basic fault" and to [[Ronald Fairbairn]]'s notion of the "compromised ego".&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Padel, "Freudianism: Later Developments", in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]], in his book ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm (1942), ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 2001) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while much earlier the existentialist like [[Kierkegaard]] had claimed that  "to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair" – the despair of choosing "to be another than himself".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Carl Rogers]], ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen Horney]], in her 1950 book, ''[[Neurosis and Human Growth]]'', based her idea of "true self" and "false self" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become.&lt;ref name="horneyk"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Neurosis and Human Growth]] | author=Horney, Karen | year=1950 | isbn=0-393-00135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Karen Horney#Theory of the self|Karen Horney §&amp;nbsp;Theory of the self]]).

==Later developments==
The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.

===Kohut&lt;!--linked from 'Self psychology'--&gt;===
{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}
Kohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. DeRobertis, ''Humanizing Child Development Theories'' (2008), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984), pp. 142, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowen===
{{Main|Alexander Lowen}}
Alexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the [[denial]], it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's [[acting out]]. And it can become a perverse force.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, Alexander. ''Narcissism: Denial of the true self''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masterson===
{{Main|James F. Masterson}}
James F. Masterson argued that all the [[personality disorders]] crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/04/20/dr_james_masterson_expert_on_personality_disorders_at_84/ Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symington===
{{Main|Neville Symington}}
Symington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the ''sources'' of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) pp. 36, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisandrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) pp. 112, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Symington stressed however the ''intentional'' element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaknin===
As part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author [[Sam Vaknin]] to raise the profile of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and [[narcissistic injury]] by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;Vaknin S [http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska ''Malignant Self-Love'' (2003) pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miller===
{{Main|Alice Miller (psychologist)}}
Alice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have ''any'' formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of the Gifted Child'' (2004) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty [[grandiosity]] of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (2004) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbach: false bodies===
{{Main|Susie Orbach}}

Susie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''Winnicott on the Child'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; so as to cover the idea of the false body –  falsified sense of one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''The Impossibility of Sex'' (Penguin 1999) pp. 48, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, in Lawrence Spurling ed., ''Winnicott Studies'' (1995) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungian persona===
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
Jungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] and Winnicott's false self;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Jacoby, ''Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem'' (1996) pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self Psychology'' (1991) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stern's tripartite self&lt;!--linked from 'Daniel Stern (psychologist)'--&gt;===
{{Main|Daniel Stern (psychologist)}}

Daniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of "going on being" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) pp. 7, 93&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; He ended however by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs, ''D. W. Winnicott'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Neville Symington]] criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego and id]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, continental analysts like [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] have made use of true/false self as a ''clinical'' distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.&lt;ref&gt;V. R. Sherwood/C. P. Cohen, ''Psychotherapy of the Quiet Borderline Patient'' (1994) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the [[anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an ''aesthetics'' of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinov ed., ''The Foucault Reader'' (1991) p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; "we have to create ourselves as a work of art".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jon Simons ed. ''Contemporary Critical Theorists'' (2006) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

{{essay|date=November 2010}}

A '''truth-bearer''' is an [[entity]] that is said to be either true or false and nothing else. The thesis that some things are true while others are false has led to different theories about the nature of these entities.  Since there is divergence of opinion on the matter, the term ''truth-bearer'' is used to be neutral among the various [[philosophical theory|theories]].  Truth-bearer candidates include [[proposition]]s, [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, [[Type–token distinction|sentence-tokens]], [[statement (logic)|statements]], [[concept]]s, [[belief]]s, [[thought]]s, [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]]s, [[utterance]]s, and [[judgement]]s but different authors exclude one or more of these, deny their existence, argue that they are true only in a derivative sense, assert or assume that the terms are synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. 
* "In [[mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], a statement (also called a proposition) is a complete declarative sentence, which is either true or false." [http://www.jcu.edu/math/Vignettes/logic.htm Vignette 17 Logic, Truth and Language]
* "A statement is just that; it is a declaration about something—anything—a declaration which can be evaluated as either true or false.  "I am reading this sentence" is a statement, and if indeed you have looked at it and comprehended its meaning, then it is safe to say that that statement can be evaluated as true."[http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm Fundamental Logic Concepts: Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522140629/http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or seek to avoid addressing their distinction or do not clarify it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. * "Some philosophers claim that declarative sentences of natural language have underlying [[logical form]]s and that these forms are displayed by [[well-formed formula|formulas]] of a [[formal language]]. Other writers hold that (successful) declarative sentences express propositions; and formulas of formal languages somehow display the forms of these propositions." {{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Stewart|title="Classical Logic" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |editor=Edward N. Zalta|year=2008|edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Some distinctions and terminology as used in this article, based on Wolfram 1989&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram |first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge, London and New York|title=Philosophical Logic|year=1989|isbn=0-415-02317-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Chapter 2 Section1) follow. 
''It should be understood that the terminology described is not always used in the ways set out, and it is introduced solely for the purposes of discussion in this article.''    Use is made of the [[type–token distinction|type–token]] and [[Use–mention distinction|use–mention]] distinctions. Reflection on [[occurrences of numerals]] might be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Occurrences of numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In grammar a sentence can be a declaration, an [[explanation]], a question, a command. In logic a declarative sentence is considered to be a sentence that can be used to communicate truth. Some sentences which are grammatically declarative are not logically so.

A '''character'''&lt;ref name=character group="nb"&gt;
'''Character''' A ''character'' is a typographic character (printed or written), a unit of speech, a phoneme, a series of dots and dashes (as sounds, magnetic pulses, printed or written), a flag or stick held at a certain angle, a gesture, a sign as use in sign language, a pattern or raised indentations (as in brail) etc. in other words the sort of things that are commonly described as the elements of an alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; is a typographic character (printed or written) etc.

A '''word-token'''&lt;ref name=wordtoken group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-token'''
A word-token is a pattern of characters.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A ''This toucan can catch a can'' contains six word-tokens&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D ''He is grnd''  contains three word-tokens&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of characters.
A '''word-type'''&lt;ref name=word-type group="nb"&gt;'''Word-type''' A word-type is an identical pattern of characters, .&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.'' contains five word-types (the word-token can occurring twice)
&lt;/ref&gt;
is an identical pattern of characters.
A '''meaningful-word-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-word-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-word-token''' A meaningful-word-token is a meaningful word-token.  ''grnd'' in D ''He is grnd.''  is not meaningful..&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful word-token.
Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same '''word-meaning'''&lt;ref name=word-meaning group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-meaning''' Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same word-meaning.  Only those word-tokens which are meaningful-word-tokens can have the same meaning as another word-token.
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.''  contains six word-meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it contains only five word-types, the two occurrences of the word-token ''can'' have different meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
On the assumption that ''bucket'' and ''pail'' mean the same, the pattern of characters B: ''If you have a bucket, then you have a pail'' contains ten word-tokens, seven word-types, and six word-meanings.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-token''' A sentence-token is a pattern of word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is a sentence-token because ''grnd'' is a word-token (albeit not a '''meaningful''' word-token.)
&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of word-tokens.
A '''meaningful-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-sentence-token''' A meaningful-sentence-token is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a sentence-token because grnd is not a meaningful word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.
Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters&lt;ref name=sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-type''' Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same sentence-type.&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''declarative-sentence-token''' is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;ref name=declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Declarative-sentence-token''' A declarative-sentence-token is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters E: ''Are you happy?'' is not a declarative-sentence-token because it interrogative not declarative.
&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token''' is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt; 
The pattern of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is grammatically ill-formed&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because thinking cannot be predicated of a stone&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters H: ''This circle is square'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is internally inconsistent&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd''  is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token
&lt;/ref&gt;
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-type'''&lt;ref name=Meaningful-declarative-sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if all tokens of which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens
&lt;/ref&gt;
if they are identical patterns of word-tokens.
A '''nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=nonsense-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''
A nonsense-declarative-sentence-token is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt;
The patterns of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'', G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' and H: ''This circle is square'' are nonsense-declarative-sentence-tokens because they are declarative-sentence-tokens but not meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens. The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a nonsense-declarative-sentence-token because it is not a declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively, rather than, say, mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters T: ''Spartacus did not eat all his spinach in London on Feb 11th 2009'' is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token but, in all probability, it has never been used declaratively and thus there have been no meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses of T.  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token can be used zero to many times. Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens-uses of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type are identical if and only if they are identical events in time and space with identical users.
&lt;/ref&gt;
occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively.

A '''referring-expression'''&lt;ref name=referring-expression group="nb"&gt;
'''Referring-expression''' An expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity, such as definite descriptions and proper names
&lt;/ref&gt;
is expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity.
A '''referential success'''&lt;ref name=referential-success group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential success''' a referring-expression’s success in identifying a particular entity OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use’s containing one or more referring-expression all of which succeed in identifying a particular entity
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expression’s success in identifying a particular entity.
A '''referential failure'''&lt;ref name=referential-failure group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential failure''' a referring-expression’s failure to identify a particular entity is referentially successful OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use’s containing one or more referring-expression that fail to identify a particular entity.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expression’s failure to identify a particular entity.
A '''referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity. A use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type U: ''The King of France is bald’'  is a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use if (and only if) the embedded referring-expression ‘The King of France’ is referentially successful.  No use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type V: ''The highest prime has no factors other than itself and 1'' is not a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use since the embedded referring-expression ''The highest prime'' is always a referential failure.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity.

==Sentences in natural languages==
As Aristotle pointed out, since some sentences are questions, commands, or meaningless, not all can be truth-bearers.
If in the proposal  "What makes the sentence ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white"   it is assumed that  '''sentences''' like ''Snow is white'' are truth-bearers, then it would be more clearly stated as "What makes the meaningful-declarative-sentence  ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white".

'''Theory 1a: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;*'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P and Q above are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if its tokens of are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens&lt;/ref&gt;)
are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Criticisms of Theory 1a'''

Some meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types''' will be both truth and false, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer, e.g. (i)  the liar-paradox sentences such as "This sentence is false". (see Fisher 2008&lt;ref name="Fisher 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=2008|isbn=0-495-00888-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (ii) Time, place and person dependent sentences e.g. "It is noon". "This is London", "I'm Spartacus".

''Anyone may ..ascribe truth and falsity to the deterministic propositional signs we here call utterances.  But if he takes this line, he must, like Leibniz, recognise that truth cannot be an affair solely of actual utterances, since it makes sense to talk of the discovery of previously un-formulated truths.'' (Kneale, W&amp;M (1962)&lt;ref name="Kneale 1962"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kneale|first=W&amp;M|title=The development of logic|publisher=Oxford|year=1962|isbn=0-19-824183-6}} page 593&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Revision to Theory 1a''', by making a distinction between type and token.

To escape the time, place and person dependent criticism the theory can be revised, making use or the [[type–token distinction]],&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfram, Sybil (1989) generally on the application of type–token distinction&lt;/ref&gt;  as follows

'''Theory 1b: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Quine argued that the '''primary''' truth-bearers are utterances &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Utterance''': The term ''utterance'' is frequently used to mean ''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.'' See e.g. Grice, '''Meaning''', 1957 http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/f09/semprag1/grice57.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now recognised in a general way that what are true are sentences, we must turn to certain refinements.  What are best seen as primarily true or false are not sentences but events of utterances.  If a man utters the words 'It is raining' in the rain, or the words 'I am hungry' while hungry, his verbal performance counts as true.  Obviously one utterance of a sentence may be true and another utterance of the same sentence be false.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
QUINE 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=QUINE |first=W.V.|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=1970|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-663625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; page 13

'''Criticisms of Theory 1b'''

(i) Theory 1b prevents sentences which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-types from being truth-bearers.  If all meaningful-declarative-sentence-types typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are true then it surely follows that the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type "The whole is greater than the part" is true (just as all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are English [[logical consequence|entails]] the meaningful-declarative-sentence-types "The whole is greater than the part" is English) (ii) Some meaningful-declarative-sentences-tokens will be both truth and false, or neither, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer.  E.g. A token, t, of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘P: I'm Spartacus’, written on a placard.  The token t would be true when used by Spartacus, false when used by Bertrand Russell, neither true nor false when mentioned by Spartacus or when being neither used nor mentioned.

'''Theory 1b.1'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To allow that at least some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types can be truth-bearers Quine allowed so-called eternal sentences&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Eternal Sentence''': A sentence that stays forever true, or forever false, independently of any special circumstances under which they happen to be uttered or written.  More exactly,  a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type whose tokens have the same truth values. E.g. ''The whole is greater than the part'' is an eternal sentence, ''It is raining'' is not an eternal sentence but ''It rains in Boston, Mass., on July 15, 1968'' is an eternal sentence&lt;/ref&gt; to be truth-bearers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Peirces's terminology, utterances and inscriptions are ''tokens'' of the sentence or other linguistic expression concerned; and this linguistic expression is the ''type'' of those utterances and inscriptions.  In Frege's terminology, truth and falsity are the two ''truth values''.  Succinctly then, an eternal sentence is a sentence whose tokens have the same truth values.... What are best regarded as true and false are not propositions but sentence tokens, or sentences if they are eternal &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Quine 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"/&gt; pages 13–14

'''Theory 1c'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1c'''

By respecting the [[use–mention]] Theory 1c avoids criticism (ii) of Theory 1b.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1c'''

(i) Theory 1c does not avoid criticism (i) of Theory 1b. (ii) meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are events (located in particular positions in time and space) and entail a user.  This implies that (a) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) anytime anywhere (b) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) in the absence of a user.  This implies that (a)  nothing was true before the evolution of users capable of using meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens and (b) nothing is true (or false) accept when being used (asserted) by a user.  Intuitively the truth (or falsity) of ‘The tree continues to be in the quad’ continues in the absence of an agent to asset it.

'''Referential Failure'''
A problem of some antiquity is the status of sentences such as 
U: The King of France is bald
V: The highest prime has no factors
W: Pegasus did not exist 
Such sentences purport to refer to entitles which do not exist (or do not always exist). They are said to suffer from referential failure.  We are obliged to choose either (a) That they are not truth-bearers and consequently neither true nor false or (b) That they are truth-bearers and per se are either true of false.

'''Theory 1d'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theory 1d takes option (a) above by declaring that meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses that fail referentially are not truth-bearers.

'''Theory 1e'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e has the same advantages as Theory 1d.  Theory 1e allows for the existence of truth-bearers (i.e., meaningful-declarative-sentence-types) in the absence of users and between uses.  If for any x, where x is a use of a referentially successful token of a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type y x is a truth-bearer then y is a truth-bearer otherwise y is not a truth bearer.  E.g. If all uses of all referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘The whole is greater than the part’ are truth-bearers (i.e. true or false) then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘The whole is greater than the part’ is a truth-bearer.  If some but not all uses of some referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘I am Spartacus’ are true then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘I am Spartacus’ is not a truth-bearer.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e makes implicit use of the concept of an agent or user capable of using (i.e. asserting) a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.  Although Theory 1e does not depend on the actual existence (now, in the past or in the future) of such users, it does depend on the possibility and cogency of their existence.  Consequently, the concept of truth-bearer under Theory 1e is dependent upon giving an account of the concept of a ‘user’.  In so far as referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are particulars (locatable in time and space) the definition of truth-bearer just in terms of referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence is attractive to those who are (or would like to be) nominalists. The introduction of ‘use’ and ‘users’ threatens the introduction of intentions, attitudes, minds &amp;c. as less-than=welcome ontological baggage

==Sentences in languages of classical logic==

In [[classical logic]] a [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] in a language is true or false under (and only under) an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] and is therefore a truth-bearer. For example, a language in the [[first-order predicate calculus]] might include one of more predicate symbols and one or more individual constants and one or more variables.  The interpretation of such a language would define a domain (universe of discourse); assign an element of the domain to each individual constant; assign the donation in the domain of some property to each unary (one-place) predicate symbol.&lt;ref&gt;See also '[[First-order logic#Semantics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a language L consisted in the individual constant ''a'', two unary predicate letters ''F'' and ''G'' and the variable ''x'', then an interpretation I of L might define the Domain D as animals, assign Socrates to ''a'',  the denotation of the property being a man to ''F'' and the denotation of the property being mortal to ''G''.  Under the interpretation I of L then ''Fa'' would be true [[if and only if|if, and only if]] Socrates is a man,  and the sentence ''{{all}}(Fx {{imp}} Gx)'' would be true if, and only if all men (in the domain) are mortal.  In some texts an interpretation is said to give   [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|"meaning"]] to the symbols of the language.  Since ''Fa'' has the value true under some (but not all interpretations) it is not the sentence-type ''Fa'' which is said to be true but only some sentence-tokens of ''Fa'' under particular interpretations. A token of ''Fa'' without an interpretation is neither true nor false.  Some sentences of a Language like L are said to be true under all interpretations of the sentence, e.g. ''{{all}}(Fx {{or-}} {{not}}Fx),'' such sentences being termed [[logical truth]]s, but again such sentences are neither true nor false in the absence of an interpretation.

==Propositions==
Many authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Russell, Wittgenstein, and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/#FacPro:  "By ‘proposition’, we shall mean truth-bearer, and remain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements, beliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for instance—except in section 2.4.1."&lt;/ref&gt; use the term '''[[proposition]]''' as truth-bearers.  There is no single definition or usage.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Matthew, "Propositions", The Stanford (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/propositions/&gt;."The term ‘proposition’ has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other “propositional attitudes” (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of sentences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Propositions |last=Mark |first=Richard |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446801663/propositions.html |date=2006 |quote=On one use of the term, "propositions" are objects of assertion, what successful uses of declarative sentences say. As such, they determine truth-values and truth conditions. On a second, they are the objects of certain psychological states (such as belief and wonder) ascribed with verbs that take sentential complements (such as believe and wonder ). On a third use, they are what are (or could be) named by the complements of such verbs. Many assume that propositions in one sense are propositions in the others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is used to mean a ''meaningful declarative sentence'' itself; sometimes it is used to mean '''the meaning of''' a meaningful declarative sentence.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosopher's tolerance towards propositions has been encouraged partly by ambiguity in the term 'proposition'. The term often is used simply for the sentences themselves, declarative sentences; and then some writers who do use the term for meanings of sentences are careless about the distinction between sentences and their meanings"  Quine 1970, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below

'''Theory 2a''': &lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences are propositions
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 2b''':&lt;blockquote&gt;
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token expresses a proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which have the same meaning express the same proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens with different meanings express different propositions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; (cf Wolfram 1989,&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;21)

''Proposition'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2a.'''  
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' propositions, as advanced by Theory 2a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the trutbearers - there is no distinct concept of proposition to consider, and the term ''proposition'' is literally redundant.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2b'''
* Theory 2b entails that if all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to say, "I am Spartacus" have the same meaning then they (i) express the same proposition (ii) that proposition is both true and false,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. when expressed by a token-meaningful-declarative-sentence made by Spartacus, and when expressed by somebody other than Spartacus&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the definition of truth-bearer.
* The concept of a proposition in this theory rests upon the concept of meaning as applied to meaningful-declarative-sentences, in a word '''synonymy''' among meaningful-declarative-sentence s.  Quine 1970 argues that the concept of synonymy among meaningful-declarative-sentences cannot be sustained or made clear, consequently the concepts of "propositions" and "meanings of sentences" are, in effect, vacuous and superfluous&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophers who favor propositions have said that propositions are needed because truth only of propositions, not of sentences [read ''meaningful-declarative-sentences'' Ed], is intelligible. An unsympathetic answer is that we can explain truth of sentences to be propositional in their own terms: sentences are true whose meanings are true propositions.  Any failure of intelligibilty here is already his own fault." Quine 1970 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

see also [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Proposition]], ''The Russell-Myhill Antinomy'', also known as the ''Principles of Mathematics Appendix B Paradox''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/par-rusm.htm]

see also [http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth/#SH4b Internet Encycypedia of Philosophy] ''Propositions are abstract entities; they do not exist in space and time. They are sometimes said to be “timeless”, “eternal”, or “omnitemporal” entities. Terminology aside, the essential point is that propositions are not concrete (or material) objects. Nor, for that matter, are they mental entities; they are not “thoughts” as Frege had suggested in the nineteenth century. The theory that propositions are the bearers of truth-values also has been criticized. Nominalists object to the abstract character of propositions. Another complaint is that it’s not sufficiently clear when we have a case of the same propositions as opposed to similar propositions. This is much like the complaint that we can’t determine when two sentences have exactly the same meaning. The relationship between sentences and propositions is a serious philosophical problem.''

==Statements==
Many authors consider ''statements'' as truth-bearers, though as with the term "proposition" there is divergence in definition and usage of that term. Sometimes 'statements' are taken to be meaningful-declarative-sentences; sometimes they are thought to be what is asserted by a meaningful-declarative-sentence.  It is not always clear in which sense the word is used. This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below.

A particular concept of a statement was introduced by Strawson in the 1950s.,&lt;ref name="Strawson 1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1950|title=On referring|journal=Mind|volume=9}} reprinted in Strawson 1971 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1957|title=Propositions, Concepts and Logical Truths|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=7}} reprinted in {{cite book| title= Logico-Linguistic Papers|last=Strawson|first=P.F.|year=1971| publisher= Methuen| isbn= 0-416-09010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952" /&gt;

Consider the following:
*I: The author of [[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]] is dead
*J: The author of [[Ivanhoe]] is dead
*K: I am less than six feet tall
*L: I am over six feet tall
*M: The conductor is a bachelor
*N: The conductor is married

On the assumption that the same person wrote Waverley and Ivanhoe, the two distinct patterns of characters (meaningful-declarative-sentences) I and J make the same statement but express different propositions. &lt;br /&gt;
The pairs of meaningful-declarative-sentences (K, L) &amp; (M, N) have different meanings, but they are not necessarily contradictory, since K &amp; L may have been asserted by different people, and M &amp; N may have been asserted about different conductors.

''What these examples show is that we cannot identify that which is true or false (the statement) with the sentence used in making it; for the same sentence may be used to make different statements, some of them true and some of them false.'' (Strawson, P.F. (1952)&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Strawson |first=P.F.|title=Introduction to Logical Theory|publisher=Methuen: London|year=1952|pages=4|isbn=0-416-68220-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This suggests:

* Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which say the same thing of the same object(s) make the same statement.

'''Theory 3a'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 3b'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences can be used to make statements 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Statement'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Arguments for Theory 3a'''
* "All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences." is either a stipulative definition or a descriptive definition.  If the former, the stipulation is useful or it is not; if the latter, either the descriptive definition correctly describes English usage or it does not. In either case no arguments, as such, are applicable

'''Criticisms of Theory 3a'''

* If the term ''statement'' is synonymous with the term ''meaningful-declarative-sentence'', then the applicable criticisms are the same as those outlined under sentence below
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' statements, as advanced by Theory 3a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the truth-bearers – there is no distinct concept of statement to consider, and the term ''statement'' is literally redundant.

'''Arguments for Theory 3b'''

== Thoughts ==
Frege (1919) argued that an indicative sentence in which we communicate or state something, contains both a thought and an assertion, it expresses the thought, and the thought is the sense of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Frege 1919"&gt;Frege (1919) ''Die Gedanke'' trans AM and Marcelle Quinton in {{cite journal|last=Frege|first=G|year=1956|title=The thought: A logical Enquiry|journal=Mind|volume=65}} reprinted in Strawson 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7715">'''''Uniclass 2015''''' is a unified classification system for all sectors of the UK construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/services/our-tools/introducing-uniclass-2015|title=Introducing Uniclass 2015|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like [[anchor plate]]s, flue liners or [[LED lamp]]s. 

Originally released in 1997, Uniclass allows project information to be structured to a recognised standard. This original version has now been heavily revised, to make it more suitable for use with modern construction industry practice, and to make it compatible with BIM ([[Building information modeling]]) now and in the future. 

Led by the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS), experts from across the industry have developed the new system, known as Uniclass 2015.  This significantly extends the scope of the previous version, and responds to industry feedback on the draft tables known as Uniclass 2, published by CPI in 2013.

Uniclass 2015 provides:

*A unified classification system for the construction industry. For the first time, buildings, landscape and infrastructure can be classified under one unified scheme
*A hierarchical suite of tables that support classification from a university campus or road network to a floor tile or kerb unit
*A numbering system that is flexible enough to accommodate future classification requirements
*A system compliant with [[ISO 12006]] that is mapped to NRM1 and supports mapping to other classification systems in the future
*A classification system that will be maintained and updated by NBS.

==Development==
Uniclass 2015 has been restructured and redeveloped to provide a comprehensive system suitable for use by the entire industry, including the infrastructure, landscape, and engineering services as well as the building sector, and for all stages in a project life cycle.

Uniclass 2015 provides a means of structuring project information essential for the adoption of BIM Level 2. Information about a project can be generated, used and retrieved throughout the life cycle.

The initial classification work has focussed on the seven core tables that describe an asset required to support the Digital Plan of Work; additional tables covering Form of Information, Project Management and Construction Aids are also under development.

Uniclass 2015 has been carefully structured to be in accordance with ISO 12006-2 ''Building construction – Organization of information about construction works – Part 2: Framework for classification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61753|title=ISO 12006-2:2015 Building construction -- Organization of information about construction works -- Part 2: Framework for classification|publisher=iso.org|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that Uniclass 2015 is particularly suited to use in an international context, as mapping to other similarly compliant schemes around the world is streamlined.

==Application==
Uniclass 2015 is divided into a set of tables, each accommodating a different ‘class’ of information.  These can be used to categorise information for costing, briefing, CAD layering, etc. as well as when preparing specifications or other production documents.

These tables are also suitable for buildings and other assets in use, and maintaining asset management and facilities management information.

==The tables==
The suite of tables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/classification#classificationtables|title=Full Uniclass 2015 classification tables|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are broadly hierarchical, and allow information about a project to be defined from the broadest view of it to the most detailed.  For detailed design and construction, the main starting point are '''Entities''', which are composed of '''Elements'''; Elements are made up of '''Systems''' which in turn contain '''Products'''. 

Entities can also be described using the '''Spaces''' and '''Activities''' tables if required, and at the more general level the '''Complexes''' table contains terms that can be thought of as groupings of Entities, Activities and Spaces.  

Looked at more closely, the tables comprise:

*'''Complexes''': a Complex describes a project in overall terms. It can be a private house with garden, drive, garage and tool shed, or it can be a University campus with buildings for lecturing, administration, sport, halls of residence, etc. Rail networks and airports are also examples of complexes
*'''Entities''': Entities are discrete things like buildings, bridges, tunnels etc. They provide the areas where different activities occur
*'''Activities''': this defines the activities to be carried out in the complex, entity or space. For example a prison complex provides a Detention activity at a high level, but can also be broken down into individual activities like exercise, sleeping, eating, working, etc.  The Activities table also includes surveys, operation and maintenance and services
*'''Spaces/Locations''': in buildings, spaces are provided for various activities to take place. In some cases a space is only suitable for one activity, for example a kitchen, but a school hall may be used for assemblies, lunches, sports, concerts and dramas. Also classed as spaces are transport corridors that run between two locations, such as the railway between London Kings Cross to Newcastle, or the M1 from London to Leeds
*'''Elements and functions''': elements are the main components of a structure like a bridge (foundations, piers, deck) or a building (floors, walls and roofs). Functions cover things like lighting, heating and water: general requirements that are not yet designed
*'''Systems''': Systems are the collection of components that go together to make an element or to carry out a function. For a pitched roof, the rafters, lining, tiles, ceiling boards, insulation and ceiling finish comprise a system, or a low temperature hot water heating system is formed from a boiler, pipework, tank, radiators etc.
*'''Products''': finally, the individual products used to construct a system can be specified, e.g. joist hangers, terrazzo tiles, gas fired boilers.

==Using the classification system==
The tables need to be flexible and to be able to accommodate sufficient codings to ensure coverage, to allow for a multitude of items and circumstances, including new technologies and developments that are yet to emerge.

Each code consists of either four or five pairs of characters. The initial pair identifies which table is being used and employs letters. The four following pairs represent groups, sub-groups, sections and objects. By selecting pairs of numbers, up to 99 items can be included in each group of codes, allowing plenty of scope for inclusion.

For example, Systems are arranged in groups with subgroups which are sub divided, which leads to the final object code.  For instance: 

*'''SS_30''' Roof, floor and paving systems
*'''SS_30_10''' Pitched, arched and domed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30''' Framed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30_25''' Heavy steel roof framing systems

or

*'''SS_50''' Disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75''' Wastewater storage, treatment and disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75_67''' Primary sewage treatment and final settlement systems
*'''SS_50_75_67_46''' Lamella tank systems
