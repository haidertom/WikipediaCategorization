      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Afro-pessimism''' is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of enslavement including the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality. 

The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Cameroonian author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71173671 |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=1405112018 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54-60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]] about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/9780822374985-003|work=Incognegro|pages=96–146|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374985|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of "accumulation and fungibility" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.

Wilderson, along with [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]] position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Discussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an [[online]] context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

In this ways the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its going struggles with poverty, health-crisis, famine, and lack of modern development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassil |first1=Noah R. |title=The roots of Afropessimism: the British invention of the 'dark continent.' |journal=Critical Arts: South-North Cultural and Media Studies |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2011-10-13 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=377-396 |issn=0256-0046 |doi=10.1080/02560046.2011.615141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victimization is then visible in the [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and development projects, which sometimes use the language of "saving" African people from such "humanitarian disasters".&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotions}}

'''Anger''' or '''wrath''' is an intense expression of [[emotion]]. It involves a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing |edition=3rd |last=Videbeck |first=Sheila L. |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger can occur when a person feels their [[personal boundaries]] are being or are about to be violated.  Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation as a way of coping. Raymond Novaco of University of California Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]-[[affective]] (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978148319968950002X|title=Advances in the Study of Aggression|last=Novaco|first=Raymond W.|date=|publisher=Academic Press|year=1986|isbn=9781483199689|editor-last=Blanchard|editor-first=Robert J.|volume=2|location=|pages=1–67|chapter=Anger as a Clinical and Social Problem|doi=10.1016/b978-1-4831-9968-9.50002-x|oclc=899004162|quote=|editor-last2=Blanchard|editor-first2=D. Caroline|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; William DeFoore, an [[anger management]] writer, described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anger : Deal with It, Heal with It, Stop It from Killing You |edition=1st |last=DeFoore |first=William |publisher=Health Communications, Inc. |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person experiencing anger will often experience physical conditions, such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased levels of [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] and [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medicine.net |title=Anger definition |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33843 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |edition= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the [[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] brain response.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, W., Schoenfeld, C. D., Gwynne, P. W., Weissler, A. M.,''Circulatory and humoral responses to fear and anger'', The Physiologist, 1964, 7, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is used as a protective mechanism to cover up fear, hurt or sadness. Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond DiGiuseppe, Raymond Chip Tafrate, ''Understanding Anger Disorders'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 133–159.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term originally comes from the term ''anger'' of [[Old Norse]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Anger,''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, 2000, Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger can have many physical and mental consequences.

The external expression of anger can be found in [[facial expression]]s, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of [[aggression]]. Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown.&lt;ref name="OxfDic"&gt;Michael Kent, ''Anger'', The Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-262845-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animals, for example, make loud sounds, attempt to look physically larger, bare their teeth, and stare.&lt;ref name="Primate"/&gt; The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants.&lt;ref name="Primate"&gt;Primate Ethology, 1967, Desmond Morris (Ed.). Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Publishers: London, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them," psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"&gt;Raymond W. Novaco, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Psychology, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern psychologists view anger as a primary, natural, and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has functional value for survival. Anger is seen as a supportive mechanism to show a person that something is wrong and requires changing. Anger can mobilize psychological resources for corrective action. Uncontrolled anger can, however, negatively affect personal or social [[Quality of life|well-being]]&lt;ref name="EncPsy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;John W. Fiero, ''Anger'', Ethics, Revised Edition, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;  and impact negatively on those around them. It is equally challenging to be around an angry person and the impact can also cause psychological/emotional trauma if not dealt with. While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory" /&gt; The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory" /&gt; [[Affect display|Displays]] of anger can be used as a [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] strategy for [[social influence]].&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"/&gt;

==Psychology and sociology==
[[File: The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|''The Anger of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] depicts the Greek hero attacking [[Agamemnon]].]]
Three types of anger are recognized by psychologists:&lt;ref name="EoE"&gt;Paul M. Hughes, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Ethics, Vol I, Second Edition, Rutledge Press&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Hasty and sudden anger''' is connected to the impulse for self-preservation. It is shared by human and other animals, and it occurs when the animal is tormented or trapped. This form of anger is episodic.
# '''Settled and deliberate anger''' is a reaction to perceived ''deliberate'' harm or unfair treatment by others. This form of anger is episodic.
# '''Dispositional anger''' is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions. Irritability, sullenness, and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger.

Anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors, promotion of [[social justice]], communication of negative sentiment, and redress of grievances. It can also facilitate patience. In contrast, anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression. Anger, in its strong form, impairs one's ability to process information and to exert [[cognitive control]] over their [[behavior]]. An angry person may lose his/her objectivity, empathy, prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=P. |first=Mohr |last2=Howells |first2=K. |last3=Gerace |first3=A. |last4=Day |first4=A. |last5=Wharton |first5=P. |year=2007 |title=The role of perspective taking in anger arousal |url= |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=507–517 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Day |first=A. |last2=Mohr |first2=P. |last3=Howells |first3=K. |last4=Gerace |first4=A. |last5=Lim |first5=L. |year=2012 |title=The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students |url= |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=599–613 |doi=10.1177/0306624X11431061 |pmid=22158909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp distinction between anger and [[aggression]] (verbal or physical, direct or indirect) even though they mutually influence each other. While anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity, it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt;

===Neuropsychological perspective===
Extension of the Stimuli of the Fighting Reactions. At the beginning of life the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force, whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines his movements. There is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli, as distinct from other stimulation, in anger. At a later date the child learns that certain actions, such as striking, scolding, and screaming, are effective toward persons, but not toward things. In adults, although the infantile response is still sometimes seen, the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence.&lt;ref name="https://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Allport/1924/1924_03.html"&gt;Fundamental Activities — Inherited and Learned&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between related concepts==
The words [[annoyance]] and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum: mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury or murderous rage at the high end. Rage problems are conceptualized as "the inability to process emotions or life's experiences"&lt;ref name=" Parker Hall 2008"&gt;Parker Hall, 2008, ''Anger, Rage and Relationship: An Empathic Approach to Anger Management'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; either because the capacity to regulate emotion (Schore, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Schore AN, 1994, ''Affect Regulation and the Origin of Self'', Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum Associates, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma. Rage is understood as raw, undifferentiated emotions, that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed, no matter how trivial, puts more [[Stress (biology)|stress]] on the [[organism]] than it can bear.

Anger, when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat, is considered as positive. The negative expression of this state is known as aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman &amp; Levenson, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment.

==Characteristics==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
One simple dichotomy of anger expression is '''passive anger''' versus '''aggressive anger''' versus '''assertive anger'''.
These three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms:
 {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Passive anger===
Passive anger can be expressed in the following ways: {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* '''[[Apathy|Dispassion]]''', such as giving someone the [[cold shoulder]] or a fake smile, looking unconcerned or "[[sitting on the fence]]" while others sort things out, dampening feelings with [[substance abuse]], overreacting, oversleeping, not responding to another's anger, frigidity, indulging in sexual practices that depress spontaneity and make objects of participants, giving inordinate amounts of time to machines, objects or intellectual pursuits, talking of frustrations but showing no feeling.
* '''[[Evasion (ethics)|Evasiveness]]''', such as turning one's back in a crisis, avoiding conflict, not arguing back, becoming [[phobia|phobic]].
* '''[[Defeatism]]''', such as [[Setting up to fail|setting yourself and others up for failure]], choosing unreliable people to depend on, being [[Accident-proneness|accident prone]], [[Underachiever|underachieving]], [[erectile disfunction|sexual impotence]], expressing frustration at insignificant things but ignoring serious ones.
* '''[[Obsessive compulsive disorder|Obsessive behavior]]''', such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy, making a habit of constantly checking things, over-dieting or overeating, demanding that all jobs be done perfectly.
* '''[[Psychological manipulation]]''', such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them, provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines, [[emotional blackmail]], [[Crocodile tears|false tearfulness]], feigning illness, [[sabotage|sabotaging]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s, using [[promiscuity|sexual provocation]], using a third party to convey negative feelings, withholding money or resources.
* '''[[Secretive|Secretive behavior]]''', such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people's backs, giving the [[silent treatment]] or under-the-breath mutterings, avoiding eye contact, putting people down, [[gossip]]ing, anonymous complaints, [[poison pen letter]]s, [[theft|stealing]], and [[confidence trick|conning]].
* '''[[Self-blame]]''', such as apologizing too often, being overly critical, inviting [[criticism]].

===Aggressive anger===
The symptoms of aggressive anger are:
* '''[[Bullying]]''', such as threatening people directly, persecuting, insulting, pushing or shoving, using power to oppress, shouting, driving someone off the road, playing on people's [[vulnerability|weaknesses]].
* '''[[Destructiveness (phrenology)|Destructiveness]]''', such as destroying objects as in [[vandalism]], [[cruelty to animals|harming animals]], [[child abuse]], destroying a relationship, [[reckless driving]], [[substance abuse]].
* '''[[Grandiosity]]''', such as showing off, expressing [[mistrust]], not delegating, being a sore loser, wanting center stage all the time, not listening, talking over people's heads, expecting kiss and make-up sessions to solve problems.
* '''Hurtfulness''', such as [[violence]], including [[sexual abuse]] and [[rape]], [[verbal abuse]], biased or [[vulgarity|vulgar joke]]s, breaking confidence, using [[profanity|foul language]], [[empathy#Lack|ignoring people's feelings]], willfully [[discrimination|discriminating]], [[blame|blaming]], punishing people for unwarranted deeds, labeling others.
* '''Risk-taking behavior''', such as speaking too fast, walking too fast,  driving too fast, reckless spending.
* '''[[Selfishness]]''', such as ignoring others' needs, not responding to requests for help, [[cutting in line|queue jumping]].
* '''[[Threat]]s''', such as [[intimidation|frightening people]] by saying how one could harm them, [[vandalism#Vandalism as crime|their property]] or their prospects, finger pointing, fist shaking, wearing clothes or symbols associated with violent behaviour, [[tailgating]], [[road rage|excessively blowing a car horn]], slamming doors.
* '''Unjust [[blame|blaming]]''', such as accusing other people for one's own mistakes, blaming people for your own feelings, making general accusations.
* '''[[Unpredictability]]''', such as explosive rages over minor [[frustration]]s, attacking indiscriminately, dispensing unjust [[punishment]], inflicting harm on others for the sake of it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playangrybirds.co.in |title=playangrybirds.co.in |publisher=playangrybirds.co.in |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2014-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419083811/http://playangrybirds.co.in/ |archive-date=2014-04-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; illogical arguments.
* '''[[revenge|Vengeance]]''', such as being over-punitive. This differs from retributive justice, as vengeance is personal, and possibly unlimited in scale.

===Assertive anger===
*'''[[Blame]]''', such as after a particular individual commits an action that’s possibly frowned upon, the particular person will resort to scolding. This is in fact, common in discipline terms.
*'''[[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]''', the angry person will give a temporary punishment to an individual like further limiting a child’s will to do anything they want like playing video games, no reading, etc, after they did something to cause trouble.
*'''Sternness''', such as calling out a person on their behaviour, with their voices raised with utter disapproval/disappointment.

===Six dimensions of anger expression===
Anger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive. Ephrem Fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. Coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person's anger expression style. Among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system, are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger, profile of the person with repressive anger, profile of the [[passive aggressive]] person, and the profile of constructive anger expression.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, E. (2008). "The angry personality: A representation on six dimensions of anger expression." In G. J Boyle, D. Matthews &amp; D. Saklofske (eds.). ''International Handbook of Personality Theory and Testing: Vol. 2: Personality Measurement and Assessment'' (pp. 402–419). London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
People feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are convinced someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with it.&lt;ref name="Anger pg 290"&gt;International Handbook of Anger. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person's car is damaged, they will feel angry if someone else did it (e.g. another driver rear-ended it), but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces (e.g. a hailstorm) or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible (e.g. he crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up "...&amp;nbsp;expecting the world to be different than it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |page=73 |isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them" and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience. Such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause. The angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional, personal, and controllable aspect of another person's behavior. This explanation, however, is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion. Anger can be of multicausal origin, some of which may be remote events, but people rarely find more than ''one'' cause for their anger.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt; According to Novaco, "Anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental-temporal context. Disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations (of anger)."&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, an internal [[infection]] can cause [[pain]] which in turn can activate anger.&lt;ref name="Britannica11"&gt;"emotion." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive effects==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}} &lt;!--The whole introduction, from "Anger makes people think..." to "...optimistic risk assessments." needs to be sourced--&gt;
Anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli. Dangers seem smaller, actions seem less risky, ventures seem more likely to succeed, and unfortunate events seem less likely. Angry people are more likely to make risky decisions, and make less realistic risk assessments. In one study, test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to suffer heart disease, and more likely to receive a pay raise, compared to fearful people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146 |author1=Jennifer S.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In inter-group relationships, anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders. Anger makes people less trusting, and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;

When a group is in conflict with a rival group, it will feel more anger if it is the politically stronger group and less anger when it is the weaker.&lt;ref name="Mackie et al"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear, angry people are more likely to demonstrate [[correspondence bias]] – the tendency to blame a person's behavior more on his nature than on his circumstances. They tend to rely more on stereotypes, and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial. In this regard, anger is unlike other "negative" emotions such as sadness and fear, which promote analytical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;International Handbook of Anger. Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;

An angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger. They will tend to rate anger-causing events (e.g. being sold a faulty car) as more likely than sad events (e.g. a good friend moving away).&lt;ref name="DeSteno et al (2000)"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery. This can create a feedback, as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still, so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person.

When people are in a certain emotional state, they tend to pay more attention to, or remember, things that are charged with the same emotion; so it is with anger. For instance, if you are trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary, if the person is currently feeling angry you would do better to use an argument that elicits anger ("more criminals will escape justice") than, say, an argument that elicits sadness ("there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children").&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike other negative emotions, which focus attention on all negative events, anger only focuses attention on anger-causing events.

Anger can make a person more desiring of an object to which his anger is tied. In a 2010 Dutch study, test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face, and then were shown an image of a random object. When subjects were made to feel angry, they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101101151730.htm |title=Anger makes people want things more |doi=10.1177/0956797610384152 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expressive strategies==
As with any emotion, the display of anger can be feigned or [[exaggerated]]. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes. Anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use (i.e. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Sutton, R. I. ''Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors'', Administrative Science Quarterly, 1991, 36:245–268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;Hochschild, AR, ''The managed heart: Commercialization of human feeling'', [[University of California Press]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Larissa Tiedens, known for her studies of anger, claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the [[perception]] of the expresser but also on their [[power position]] in the [[society]]. She studied the [[correlation]] between anger expression and social influence perception. Previous researchers, such as Keating, 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high [[social position]].&lt;ref name="Tiedens 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tiedens L. Z |title=Anger and advancement versus sadness and subjugation: the effect of negative emotion expressions on social status conferral |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11195894&amp;dopt=Citation |work=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=January 2001 |access-date=2015-11-27 |volume=80 |number=1 |pages=86–94 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.1.86 |pmid=11195894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tiedens et al. have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character, attributed a higher [[social status]] to the angry character.&lt;ref name="Tiedens et al.,2000"/&gt; Tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution. In other words, whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others' behaviors. Her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one. In addition, it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner, and was attributed a certain social status accordingly.&lt;ref name="Tiedens 2001"/&gt;

Showing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in [[negotiation]]. A study by Tiedens et al. indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn, dominant and powerful. In addition, it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn, rather than soft and submissive.&lt;ref name="Tiedens et al.,2000"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tiedens |first=Ellsworth |last2=Tiedens |first2=Mesquita |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/5/560 |title=Sentimental Stereotypes: Emotional Expectations for High-and Low-Status Group Members |year=2000 |publisher=Psp.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these findings Sinaceur and Tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non-angry one.&lt;ref&gt;M Sinaceur, LZ Tiedens, Get mad and get more than even: When and why anger expression is effective in negotiations, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A question raised by Van Kleef et al. based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others, since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others' limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly. Van Kleef et al. wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent. Findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent. These results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent's emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Van Kleef, De Dreu and Manstead, ''The Interpersonal Effects of Anger and Happiness in Negotiations'', Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2004, Vol. 86, No. 1, 57–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coping strategies==
{{main|Anger management}}
According to Leland R. Beaumont, each instance of anger demands making a choice.&lt;ref&gt;Leland R. Beaumont, Emotional Competency, [http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/anger.htm#path Anger, An Urgent Plea for Justice and Action], Entry describing paths of anger&lt;/ref&gt; A person can respond with [[hostility|hostile]] action, including overt [[violence]], or they can respond with hostile inaction, such as withdrawing or stonewalling. Other options include initiating a dominance contest; harboring [[resentment]]; or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue.

According to R. Novaco, there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion. In order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed, Novaco suggests. The situations leading to anger should be explored by the person. The person is then tried to be imagery-based relieved of his or her recent angry experiences.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novaco, R. (1975). Anger control: The development and evaluation of an experimental treatment. Lexington, MA: Heath.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger. These therapies often come within the schools of CBT (or [[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive Behavioural Therapies]]) like modern systems such as REBT ([[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]). Research shows that people who suffer from excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s, assumptions and [[evaluation]]s in specific situations. It has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional, individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beck |first=Richard |last2=Fernandez |first2=Ephrem |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Anger: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=63–74 |year=1998 |url=http://www.acu.edu/img/assets/6655/Cognitive-Behavioral%20in%20the%20Treatment%20of%20Anger%20(A%20Meta-analysis).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905115446/http://www.acu.edu/img/assets/6655/Cognitive-Behavioral%20in%20the%20Treatment%20of%20Anger%20(A%20Meta-analysis).pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-05 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-05 |doi=10.1023/A:1018763902991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy is followed by the so-called "stress inoculation" in which the clients are taught "relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention, thoughts, images, and feelings. They are taught to see the provocation and the anger itself as occurring in a series of stages, each of which can be dealt with."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

The Skills-deficit model states that poor [[social skills]] is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner.&lt;ref&gt;Frederiksen, L.W., and Eisler, R.M. (1977). The control of explosive behavior: A skill development approach. In D. Upper (Ed.), Perspectives in Behavior Therapy. Kalamazoo, MI: Behaviordelia. Ranhiam, S., LeFebre, C., and Jenkins, J.O. 1980. The effects of social skills training on behavioral and cognitive components of anger management. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 11, 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual. Research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening, and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, H.. Emotions: A basic problem for social psychology. In C. Nemeth (Ed.), Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1981 study, that used modeling, behavior rehearsal, and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills, showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, D.J., Dorsett, P.G., and Milan, M. (1981). A total assessment approach to the evaluation of social skills training: The effectiveness of an anger control program for adolescent psychiatric patients. Behavioral Assessment, 3, 383–402.&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted with youthful offenders using a social skills training program (aggression replacement training), found significant reductions in anger, and increases in anger control.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, B., and Goldstein, A.P., (1987). Aggression replacement training. Journal of Counseling and Development, 65, 356–361.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards. Learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, D., Dorr, J., Walker &amp; J Bonner (eds.), New York:Norton (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Social Learning Theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. Aggression:A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting. This research found that low fear messages  were less provocative to the ASPD population, and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate, and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderlin, T.K., and Cellini, H.R., "Anger Management Intervention with Offender Populations". Offender Programs Report, Vol. 2. No. 4, November/December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive behavioral affective therapy===
A new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by Ephrem Fernandez (2010)&lt;ref&gt;"Toward an Integrative Psychotherapy for Maladaptive Anger," ''International Handbook of Anger''.&lt;/ref&gt; Termed CBAT, for cognitive behavioral affective therapy, this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with affective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger. The techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment: prevention, intervention, and postvention. In this way, people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger, its progression, and the residual features of anger.

===Suppression===
Modern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects. The suppressed anger may find another outlet, such as a physical symptom, or become more extreme.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anger." Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology, 2nd ed. [[Thomson Gale|Gale Group]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; John W. Fiero cites [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] as an example of sudden, explosive release of suppressed anger. The anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter. There is also the case of [[Francine Hughes]], who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse. Her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband. It is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize, experience, and process negative emotion and this has a destabilizing influence on their perception of agency in their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cupid's Knife: Women's Anger and Agency in Violent Relationships|last=Stein|first=Abby|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415527866|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward [[scapegoating]], Fiero says, was the blaming of [[Jews]] for the economic ills of [[Germany]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt; 

However, psychologists have also criticized the "catharsis theory" of aggression, which suggests that "unleashing" pent-up anger reduces aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence against catharsis theory:

==Dual thresholds model==
Anger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well, such as decrease of productivity&lt;ref&gt;Jehn, K. A. 1995. A multimethod examination of the benefits and detriments of intragroup conflict. Administrative Science Quarterly, 40: 256–282.&lt;/ref&gt; and increase of job stress,&lt;ref&gt;Glomb, T. M. 2002. Workplace anger and aggression: Informing conceptual models with data from specific encounters. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 7: 20–36.&lt;/ref&gt; however it could also have positive outcomes, such as increased work motivation, improved relationships, increased mutual understanding etc. (for ex. Tiedens, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Tiedens, L. Z. 2000. Powerful emotions: The vicious cycle of social status positions and emotions. In N. M. Ashkanasy, C. E. J. Ha¨ rtel, &amp; W. J. Zerbe (Eds.), Emotions in the workplace: Research, theory and practice: 71–81. Westport, CT: Quorum.&lt;/ref&gt; A Dual Thresholds Model of Anger in organizations by Geddes and Callister, (2007) provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes. The model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger. The first "expression threshold" is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger-provoking situation. The second "impropriety threshold" is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and/or culturally inappropriate.

The higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations. The first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger—that is, they fail to cross the "expression threshold". In this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger-provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem, allowing it to continue, along with the affected individual's anger. The second is when organizational members cross both thresholds—"double cross"— displaying anger that is perceived as deviant. In such cases the angry person is seen as the problem—increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger-provoking incident. In contrast, a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one's expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds. Here, one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable, prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved. This space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself: when the change is directed to support anger displays; the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays; the space will be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, D. &amp; Callister, R. 2007 Crossing The Line(s): A Dual Threshold Model of Anger in Organizations, Academy of Management Review. 32 (3): 721–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurology ==
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
In [[neuroimaging]] studies of anger, the most consistently activated region of the brain was the lateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;International Handbook of Anger. ''Chapt 4: Constructing a Neurology of Anger''. Michael Potegal and Gerhard Stemmler. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This region is associated with approach motivation and positive affective processes.&lt;ref&gt;International Handbook of Anger. ''Chapt 17''. Michael Potegal and Gerhard Stemmler. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSI theory uses emotions as a guide for the memory to process, plan and initiate an action to fulfill a current need.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are 3 parameters that help in regulating the information process along with the behaviour tendencies (flight, exploration, aggression, etc.) that show the individual how they should react.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dörner|first1=Dietrich|last2=Güss|first2=C. Dominik|title=PSI: A Computational Architecture of Cognition, Motivation, and Emotion|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=297–317|doi=10.1037/a0032947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Resolution level
* Selection threshold
* Activation

'''Resolution level'''

Situations can be associated in terms of breadth and width so that information can be retrieved from the long-term memory and the PSI system can get ideas that vary with depending on the information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the resolution level was deep and wide more information could be retrieved, allowing the creation of more idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While if the resolution level was short and narrow lesser information is extracted, therefore creating fewer ideas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Selection Threshold'''

It allows the control of motivation, in way where you can focus on one motive or on a number at a given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is very dependent on the activation parameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general threshold is around mid-level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So, if the threshold was high the PSI focuses on the current motive while other needs become irrelevant or possess little interest to the individual at the time, but the individual will overlook all dangers and opportunities of the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if the threshold was lower, the individual will get distracted very easily and the motivations can vary at any given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Activation'''

The level of competence is affected by the level of activation and can direct the individual to become ready for action or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general competence level is around mid-level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the activation on high the level of competence drops so that the individual becomes more action ready.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So, when low the competence level is high, and the individual is not as ready to jump into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Anger Regulation'''

The activation level will increase so that the individual becomes more action ready and, this in turn increases the selection threshold causing the individual to focus solely on the trigger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The resolution level will drop so that perception and planning become low resulting in a quick action that may be risky and perhaps lead to aggression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Neuroscience]] has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the [[Human brain|brain]].

Emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features, thoughts, or memories however occurs when its information is relayed from the [[thalamus]] to the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name="Britannica11"/&gt; Based on some [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be [[Heredity|genetic]].

==Philosophical perspectives==
[[File:FLAXMAN John The Fury Of Athamas.jpg|thumb|right|''The Fury of [[Athamas]]'' by [[John Flaxman]] (1755–1826).]]

===Ancient history===
Ancient Greek philosophers, describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger, particularly toward slaves, in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger. [[Galen]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] regarded anger as a kind of madness. They all rejected the spontaneous, uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger. There were however disagreements regarding the value of anger. For Seneca, anger was "worthless even for war." Seneca believed that the disciplined Roman army was regularly able to beat the Germans, who were known for their fury. He argued that "...&amp;nbsp;in sporting contests, it is a mistake to become angry".&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] on the other hand, ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Aristotle: "The person who is angry at the right things and toward the right people, and also in the right way, at the right time and for the right length of time is morally praiseworthy." cf. Paul M. Hughes, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Ethics, Vol I, Second Edition, Rutledge Press&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility, Aristotle stated.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; The difference in people's temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained. Seneca held that "red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Ancient philosophers rarely refer to women's anger at all, according to Simon Kemp and K. T. Strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women. Some of them that discuss it, such as Seneca, considered women to be more prone to anger than men.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

====Control methods====
{{wikisource|Of Anger}}
[[Seneca the younger|Seneca]] addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts: 1. how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2. how to cease being angry and 3. how to deal with anger in others.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Seneca suggests, to avoid becoming angry in the first place, that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered. One should avoid being too busy or deal with anger-provoking people. Unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; To cease being angry, Seneca suggests "one to check speech and impulses and be aware of particular sources of personal irritation. In dealing with other people, one should not be too inquisitive: It is not always soothing to hear and see everything. When someone appears to slight you, you should be at first reluctant to believe this, and should wait to hear the full story. You should also put yourself in the place of the other person, trying to understand his motives and any extenuating factors, such as age or illness."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Seneca further advises daily self-inquisition about one's [[Behavioral addiction|bad habit]].&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; To deal with anger in others, Seneca suggests that the best reaction is to simply keep calm. A certain kind of deception, Seneca says, is necessary in dealing with angry people.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

Galen repeats Seneca's points but adds a new one: finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions. Galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Both Seneca and Galen (and later philosophers) agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability. Seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely. At the same time, they should not be pampered. Children, Seneca says, should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them. Seneca also advises that children's requests should not be granted when they are angry.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

===Post-classical history===
{{See also|The four humours}}
During the period of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Middle Ages]], philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger, many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept. For example, many medieval philosophers such as [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; On the other hand, [[al-Ghazali]] (Algazel), who often disagreed with Aristotle and Ibn Sina on many issues, argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three "powers" in their [[Qalb|heart]], the other two being [[appetite]] and [[Impulse (psychology)|impulse]]. He also argued that animal [[Will (philosophy)|will]] is "conditioned by anger and appetite" in contrast to human will which is "conditioned by the [[Intelligence|intellect]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [367] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler (hence the word "choleric").&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; This belief was related to Seneca's belief that "red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors."

;By gender
Wrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused, sometimes even homicide. It served to ignore those who are present, contradicts those who are absent, produces insults, and responds harshly to insults that are received.&lt;ref&gt;In the Garden of Evil: Vices and Culture in the Middle Ages. Richard Newhauser. PIMS, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self- defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged. Aquinas felt that if anger was justified, it was not a sin. For example, "He that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked. Therefore to be angry is not always an evil."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas Blackfriars; McGraw-Hill, N. Y. K. 1963, Question 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power. Many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion, shape, and disposition. Complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat, coldness, moistness, and dryness. When various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals. Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen all agreed on that, in terms of biology and sexual differentiation, heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition. Disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities, the four elements and the four humors. For example, the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness: fire dominated in yellow bile or choler, meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others. Hot and dry individuals were active, dominant, and aggressive. The opposite was true with the element of water. Water, is cold and moist, related closely to phlegm: people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive. While these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the Middle Ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;In the Garden of Evil: Vices and Culture in the Middle Ages. Richard Newhauser. PIMS, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

;Women
Scholars posted that females were seen by authors in the Middle Ages to be more phlegmatic (cold and wet) than males, meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Women's passive nature appeared "natural" due to their lack of power when compared to men. Aristotle identified traits he believed women shared: female, feminine, passive, focused on matter, inactive, and inferior. Thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; However [[Hildegard of Bingen]] believed women were fully capable of anger. While most women were phlegmatic, individual women under certain circumstances could also be choleric.

;Men
Medieval scholars believed most men were choleric, or hot and dry. Thus they were dominant and aggressive. (Barton) Aristotle also identified characteristics of men: male, masculine, active, focused on form, potent, outstanding, and superior. Men were aware of the power they held. Given their choleric "nature", men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; [[Peter of Albano]] once said, "The male's spirit, is lively, given to violent impulse; [it is] slow getting angry and slower being calmed." Medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women. Masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors, and men were not angry all the time. Every man's [[humorism|humoral]] balance was different, some men were strong, other weak, also some more prone to wrath then others.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; There are those who view anger as a manly act. For instance, David Brakke maintained:&lt;blockquote&gt;because anger motivated a man to action in righting wrongs to himself and others, because its opposite appeared to be passivity in the face of challenges from other males, because - to put it simply - it raised the body's temperature, anger appeared to be a characteristic of masculinity, a sign that a man was indeed a manly man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behold the Man: Jesus and Greco-Roman Masculinity|last=Conway|first=Colleen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780195325324|location=New York|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Control methods====
[[Maimonides]] considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness. Like Galen, Maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses. Roger Bacon elaborates Seneca's advices. Many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance. In a discussion of [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[John Mirk]], an English 14th-century [[Augustinian]] writer, tells priests how to advise the [[penance|penitent]] by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger:&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

In ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) modified the theory of [[temperament]]s and argued that anger heralded the transition of [[melancholia]] to mania, and explained that [[humidity]] inside the head can contribute to such [[mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [366] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On the other hand, [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi]] classified anger (along with aggression) as a type of [[neurosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [362] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Modern history===
The modern understanding of anger may not be greatly advanced over that of Aristotle.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] rejects revenge as vicious. Regarding the latter, [[David Hume]] argues that because "anger and [[hatred]] are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution, the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility."&lt;ref name="EoE"/&gt; Two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected, Kemp and Strongman state: one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the [[Anger#Suppression|suppression of anger]]; the other is that, recently, studies of anger take the issue of [[gender differences]] into account. The latter does not seem to have been of much concern to earlier philosophers.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has suggested that anger, rage, and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret [[wikt:transgression|transgression]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellis, these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples' humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed.

==Religious perspectives==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Anger in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], anger is a negative trait. In the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Jacob]] condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel."&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;[[Kaufmann Kohler]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1523&amp;letter=A Anger], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as [[Ethics of the Fathers]] states:

"[[Ben Zoma]] said:
Who is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated,
'He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city' (Proverbs 16:32)."&lt;ref&gt;Ethics of the Fathers 4:1&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, Hilchot de'ot 2&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry, one shows a disregard of [[Divine Providence]] – whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from Above – and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of [[God]] in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaTanya, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

In its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, the ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' states: "Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry."&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 29:4&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern writings, Rabbi [[Harold Kushner]] finds no grounds for anger toward God because "our misfortunes are none of His doing."&lt;ref&gt;Harold S. Kushner, ''When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' (Schocken Books, 1981), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kushner's reading of the [[Bible]], David Blumenthal finds an "abusing God" whose "sometimes evil" actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester's relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Blumenthal |title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest (Westminster/John Knox, 1993) |page=223 |url=http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |publisher=Religion.emory.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115041028/http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |archivedate=2014-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers have addressed anger.

====Catholic====
[[File:Boschsevendeadlysins.jpg|thumb|''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1485). "Wrath" is depicted at the bottom in a series of circular images. Below the image is the [[Latin]] inscription ''Cave Cave Deus Videt'' ("Beware, Beware, God is Watching").]]
[[File:Rage-and-anger-fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Angel]] with [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] and [[Humility]] [[virtue]]s versus [[Devil]] with [[Rage (emotion)|Rage]] and Wrath [[sins]]. A fresco from the 1717 Saint Nicolas [[Orthodox church]] in Cukovets, [[Pernik Province]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Wrath is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Catholicism; and yet the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (canons 1772 and 1773) that anger is among the passions, and that "in the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither good nor evil." The neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it's directed against an innocent person, when it's unduly unbending or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. "If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin." (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302-03)

[[History of Christianity|Medieval Christianity]] vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal, or [[Seven Deadly Sins|deadly sins]], but some Christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"&gt;Simon Kemp, K.T. Strongman, ''Anger theory and management: A historical analysis'', The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 108, No. 3. (Autumn, 1995), pp. 397–417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]] viewed anger as a "reprehensible temporary madness."&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt; Joseph F. Delany in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1914) defines anger as "the desire of vengeance" and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy. Vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity. For example, "vengeance upon one who has not deserved it, or to a greater extent than it has been deserved, or in conflict with the dispositions of law, or from an improper motive" are all sinful. An unduly vehement vengeance is considered a [[venial sin]] unless it seriously goes counter to the love of God or of one's neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Anger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive view of anger is espoused by Roman Catholic pastoral theologian [[Henri Nouwen|Henri J. M. Nouwen]]. Father Nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward God as found in both the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]]. In the Bible, says Father Nouwen, "it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to God will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Henri J. M. Nouwen, "Forward" in ''May I Hate God?'' Pierre Wolff, 2 (Paulist Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Bernanos]] illustrates Nouwen's position in his novel ''The Diary of a Country Priest''. The countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted, but the child died. She was fiercely angry. When the priest called, the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband, then at the priest who responded gently, "open your heart to [God]." The countess rejoined, "I've ceased to bother about God. When you've forced me to admit that I hate Him, will you be any better off?" The priest continued, "you no longer hate Him. Hate is indifference and contempt. Now at last you're face to face with Him&amp;nbsp;... Shake your fist at Him, spit in His face, scourge Him." The countess did what the priest counseled. By confessing her hate, she was enabled to say, "all's well."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bernanos, ''The Diary of a Country Priest'' (London: Fontana Books, 1956), 126–150 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestant====
Everyone experiences anger, Andrew D. Lester observes, and furthermore anger can serve as "a spiritual friend, a spiritual guide, and a spiritual ally." Denying and suppressing anger is contrary to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul's]] admonition in his [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] 4:26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew D. |last=Lester |title=Anger: Discovering Your Spiritual Ally - (Westminster John Knox, 2007) |pages=11–12 |url=http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Acpe.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017044703/http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When anger toward God is denied and suppressed, it interferes with an individual's relation with God. However, expressing one's anger toward God can deepen the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew D. |last=Lester |title=Coping with Your Anger: A Christian Guide - (Westminster John Knox, 1983) |pages=92–94 |url=http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Acpe.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017044703/http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. FitzSimons Allison]] holds that "we worship God by expressing our honest anger at him."&lt;ref&gt;C. FitzSimons Allison, Guilt, Anger, and God (Regent College Publishing, 2003. 1st published by Seabury Press, 1972), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bible|Biblical]] scholar Leonard Pine concludes from his studies in the [[Book of Habakkuk]] that "far from being a sin, proper remonstration with God is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with Him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leonard |last=Pine |title=Remonstrating with God in Adversity: A Study in Habakkuk |journal=WRS |volume=3:1 (February 1996) 21–26 |url=http://www.wrs.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other biblical examples of anger toward God include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[[New Revised Standard Version]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moses]] was angry with God for mistreating his people: "Lord, why have you mistreated [''lit.'' done evil to] this people?" ([[Book of Exodus]] 5:22).
* [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] was angry with God after the death of her husband and two sons: "The Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. The Almighty has brought calamity upon me" ([[Book of Ruth]] 1:20–21 ''abr'').
* [[Elijah]] was angry with God after the son of the widow died: "O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 17:20).
* [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] was angry with God: "You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me" ([[Book of Job]] 30:21).
* [[Jeremiah]] was angry with God for deceiving his people: "Ah, Lord God, how utterly you have deceived this people and Jerusalem." ([[Book of Jeremiah]] 4:10).

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire. The objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part22/chap11.htm Anger (HinduDharma: Dharmas Common To All)], Shri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively if one thinks one is superior, the result is grief. Anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2004/7-9/40-49_anger.shtml Anger Management: How to Tame our Deadliest Emotion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121213147/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2004/7-9/40-49_anger.shtml |date=2008-01-21 }}, by Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] [[Krishna]] regards greed, anger, and lust as signs of ignorance and leads to perpetual bondage. As for the agitations of the bickering mind, they are divided into two divisions. The first is called avirodha-prīti, or unrestricted attachment, and the other is called virodha-yukta-krodha, anger arising from frustration. Adherence to the philosophy of the Māyāvādīs, belief in the fruitive results of the karma-vādīs, and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha-prīti. (Reference needed)

Jñānīs, karmīs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls, but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated, they become angry. Frustration of material desires produces anger.&lt;ref&gt;The Nectar of Instruction 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2017}}
Anger is defined in [[Buddhism]] as: "being unable to bear the object, or the intention to cause harm to the object." Anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration, and is listed as one of the [[five hindrances]]. Buddhist monks, such as [[Dalai Lama]], the spiritual leader of Tibetans in exile, sometimes get angry.&lt;ref name="urbandharma"&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl030904.html The Urban Dharma Newsletter], March 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a difference; most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled. Thus, in response to the question: "Is any anger acceptable in Buddhism?' the Dalai Lama answered:&lt;ref name="urbandharma"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage, I do not accept that anger of any kind as ''(sic)'' a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior. The [[Gautama Buddha]] ''(sic)'' has taught that there are three basic [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] at the root of [[samsara]] (bondage, illusion) and the vicious cycle of rebirth. These are greed, hatred, and delusion—also translatable as attachment, anger, and ignorance. They bring us confusion and misery rather than peace, happiness, and fulfillment. It is in our own self-interest to purify and transform them. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Buddhist scholar and author Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]] has also explained [[Buddha]]'s teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0978906713 How to Solve our Human Problems], Tharpa Publications (2005, US ed., 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations, we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind. If we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us. Eventually, we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind. Therefore if we want to be free from problems, we must transform our mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Buddha himself on anger:&lt;ref name="Kodhana Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.than.html "Kodhana Sutta: An Angry Person"(AN 7.60), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight], June 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An angry person is ugly &amp; sleeps poorly. Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss, having done damage with word &amp; deed. A person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, &amp; colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn't realize that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn't know his own benefit. An angry person doesn't see the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]. A man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Islam===
A verse in the third [[surah]] of the Quran instructs people to restrain their anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|3|134|t=a|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger (Arabic:غضب, ''ghadab'') in Islam is considered to be instigated by Satan (''[[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muhaiyaddeen |first=M. R. Bawa |title=Islam &amp; World Peace: Explanations of a Sufi |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8grB4SKJrXsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64|isbn=9780914390657 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness, arrogance and excessive ambition.&lt;ref name="Path"&gt;{{cite book |last=Efendi |first=Birgivî Mehmet |last2=Bayrak |first2=Tosun |title=The Path Of Muhammad: A Book On Islamic Morals And Ethics |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLFZ8f8trUgC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182|isbn=9780941532686 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith (''[[iman (concept)|iman]]'') of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=Kınalızade Ali |last=Çelebi |first2=Muḥammad ibn Muṣṭafá |last2=Khādimī |title=Ethics of Islam |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQP-Nhmq6VIC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran attributes anger to [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]] and believers as well as Muhammad's enemies. It mentions the anger of Moses (''[[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]]'') against his people for worshiping a [[golden calf]] and at the moment when Moses strikes an Egyptian for fighting against an Israelite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|150|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anger of Jonah (''[[Islamic view of Jonah|Yunus]]'') is also mentioned in the Quran, which led to his departure from the people of [[Nineveh]] and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|87|e=88|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of anger from the hearts of believers by [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Allah|{{Rtl-lang|ar|الله}}]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'') after the fighting against [[Muhammad]]'s enemies is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|15|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AngerQ"/&gt; In general, suppression of anger (Arabic: کاظم, ''kazm'') is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis.&lt;ref name="AngerQ"&gt;Bashir, Shahzad. ''Anger'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]], Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|73|135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Abu-Nimer, ''Non-Violence, Peacebuilding, Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Islam:A Framework for Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam'', Journal of Law and Religion, Vol. 15, No. 1/2. (2000–2001), pp. 217–265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yusuf ibn abd al-Barr|Ibn Abdil Barr]], the Andalusian Maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy, since these two are less powerful than anger. The hadis state various ways to diminish, prevent and control anger. One of these methods is to perform a [[wudu|ritual ablution]], a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instructs the angry person to invoke God and seek refuge from the Devil, by reciting ''I take refuge with Allah/God from the accursed Devil.''

It has also been stated by the Imam Ali, the "Commander of the faithful" and the son-in-law of prophet Muhammad that "A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret." As well as "Anger begins with madness, and ends in regret."&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

===Divine retribution===
[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'', by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1789–1854).]]
In many religions, anger is frequently attributed to God or gods. Primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion.&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"/&gt; [[Hebrew Bible|The Hebrew Bible]] says that opposition to God's Will results in God's anger.&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"&gt;Shailer Mathews, Gerald Birney Smith, A Dictionary of Religion and Ethics, Kessinger Publishing, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[rabbi]] Kaufmann Kohler explains:&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;God is not an intellectual abstraction, nor is He conceived as a being indifferent to the doings of man; and His pure and lofty nature resents most energetically anything wrong and impure in the moral world: "O Lord, my God, mine Holy One&amp;nbsp;... Thou art of eyes too pure to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Christians believe in God's anger at the sight of evil. This anger is not inconsistent with God's love, as demonstrated in the Gospel where the righteous indignation of Christ is shown in the [[Cleansing of the Temple]]. Christians believe that those who reject His revealed Word, Jesus, condemn themselves, and are not condemned by the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]].&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"/&gt;

'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.&lt;ref name="Berger&amp;Calabrese"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, C. 1979.

Berger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|pages=|issn=0270-6075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Stephan&amp;Stephan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they don’t feel secure and they aren’t sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individuals’ distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].&lt;ref name="Doise"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/levels-of-explanation-in-social-psychology/oclc/13004532|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

• The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/45409297|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we're misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we're misinterpreting others' behavior but don't do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"&lt;ref name="Blalock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25192027|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|location=|pages=|oclc=651907062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co|isbn=978-0201523416|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18779775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|edition=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=914195352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, P., Evett, S., &amp; Vasquez-Suson, K. (1996). "Exploring the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup contact". In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition''. (Vol 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;423–464). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=305|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures.

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, G., &amp; Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–619). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt;.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177–193|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

'''''Centrum voor Gelijkheid van Kansen en voor Racismebestrijding v Firma Feryn NV''''' (2008) C-54/07 is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the [[free movement of goods]] in the European Union.

==Facts==
Mr Pascal Feryn, one of the directors of a door installation company called Firma Feryn NV, said it would not employ immigrants from Morocco in customers' houses, because allegedly his customers were opposed. In an interview he said 'people often say: ‘no immigrants’.... I must comply with my customers’ requirements.’&lt;ref&gt;'Customers do not want Moroccans' (28 April 2005) De Standaard&lt;/ref&gt; The CGKR (Centre for equal opportunities and opposition to racism) contended that this policy was a breach of the [[Racial Equality Directive]] 2000/43/EC, as it constituted direct discrimination.

The President of the Arbeidsrechtbank [[Brussels]] held that the public statements did not count as discrimination. They were merely evidence of potential discrimination. The CGKR did not show that anyone was ever actually turned down.

==Judgment==

===Advocate General Opinion===
[[Advocate General Maduro]] advised that it was direct discrimination.

{{Cquote|17. It would lead to awkward results if discrimination of this type were for some reason to be excluded altogether from the scope of the Directive, because by implication Member States would be permitted, under the Directive, to allow employers to differentiate very effectively between candidates on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, simply by publicising the discriminatory character of their recruitment policy as overtly as possible beforehand. Thus, the most blatant strategy of employment discrimination might also turn out to be the most 'rewarding'. That would clearly undermine rather than promote conditions for a socially inclusive labour market. In short, it would defeat the very purpose of the Directive if public statements made by an employer in the context of a recruitment drive, to the effect that applications from persons of a certain ethnic origin would be turned down, were held to fall outside the concept of direct discrimination.

18. The contention made by Mr Feryn that customers would be unfavourably disposed towards employees of a certain ethnic origin is wholly irrelevant to the question whether the Directive applies. Even if that contention were true, it would only illustrate that 'markets will not cure discrimination'&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, C., 'Why markets don't stop discrimination', in: Free markets and social justice, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; and that regulatory intervention is essential. Moreover, the adoption of regulatory measures at Community level helps to solve a collective action problem for employers by preventing the distortion of competition that precisely because of that market failure could arise if different standards of protection against discrimination existed at national level.

19. I therefore suggest that the Court give the following answer to the first and second questions referred by the national court: a public statement made by an employer in the context of a recruitment drive, to the effect that applications from persons of a certain ethnic origin will be turned down, constitutes direct discrimination within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the Directive.

[...]

25. I accordingly propose that the Court give the following answer to the third, fourth and fifth questions referred by the national court: once a prima facie case of discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin has been established, it is for the respondent to prove that the principle of equal treatment has not been infringed.

[...]

28.  It is for the referring court to determine, in accordance with the relevant rules of domestic law, which remedy would be appropriate in the circumstances of the present case. However, in the main, purely token sanctions are not sufficiently dissuasive to enforce the prohibition of discrimination. Therefore, it would seem that a court order prohibiting such behaviour would constitute a more appropriate remedy.}}

===Court of Justice===
The European Court of Justice held that an advertisement would dissuade applicants for employment and constituted direct discrimination. It was unnecessary to show there was actually a dissuasive effect, but the company was entitled to bring evidence to show its practices were not discriminatory.

{{Cquote|22. It is true that, as those two Member States contend, Article 2(2) of Directive 2000/43 defines direct discrimination as a situation in which one person 'is treated' less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. Likewise, Article 7 of that directive requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to 'all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them' and to public interest bodies bringing judicial proceedings 'on behalf or in support of the complainant'.

23. Nevertheless, it cannot be inferred from this that the lack of an identifiable complainant leads to the conclusion that there is no direct discrimination within the meaning of Directive 2000/43. The aim of that directive, as stated in recital 8 of its preamble, is 'to foster conditions for a socially inclusive labour market'. For that purpose, Article 3(1)(a) states that the directive covers, inter alia, selection criteria and recruitment conditions.

24. The objective of fostering conditions for a socially inclusive labour market would be hard to achieve if the scope of Directive 2000/43 were to be limited to only those cases in which an unsuccessful candidate for a post, considering himself to be the victim of direct discrimination, brought legal proceedings against the employer.

25. The fact that an employer declares publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin, something which is clearly likely to strongly dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market, constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Directive 2000/43. The existence of such direct discrimination is not dependant on the identification of a complainant who claims to have been the victim.

[...]

31. Statements by which an employer publicly lets it be known that, under its recruitment policy, it will not recruit any employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin may constitute facts of such a nature as to give rise to a presumption of a discriminatory recruitment policy.

32. It is, thus, for that employer to adduce evidence that it has not breached the principle of equal treatment, which it can do, inter alia, by showing that the actual recruitment practice of the undertaking does not correspond to those statements.

33. It is for the national court to verify that the facts alleged against that employer are established and to assess the sufficiency of the evidence which the employer adduces in support of its contentions that it has not breached the principle of equal treatment.}}

'''Clara Tice''' (22 May 1888 – 2 February 1973) was an American [[avant-garde]] illustrator and artist, who spent most of her life in [[New York City, United States]]. Because of her provocative art and public appearances, she was seen as representative of bohemian [[Greenwich Village]] and thus known as "The Queen of Greenwich Village."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.|authorlink=Clara Tice|editor=Naomi Sawelson-Gorse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to herself and the ''[[New York Times]]'', in 1908 Tice was the first woman in Greenwich Village to bob her hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogue of Bobbed Hair: Of Course Greenwich Village Lassies Wear Short Locks, But Society's Doing It Too|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1920|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Tice was able to study under the famous artist and teacher [[Robert Henri]]. In 1910, Henri and some of his artist friends, organized the first exhibition of Independent Artist. This art show, which was with its jury-free and no-awards concept quite a revolution at that time and thus received enormous attention, was financially backed by Tice and featured her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=415–416|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immersion in the arts ==
A few years later, namely in 1915, Tice's fame skyrocketed when [[Anthony Comstock]], main founder of the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], tried to confiscate Tice's art at the well-known bohemian restaurant Polly's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=New York Dada 1915-23.|year=1994|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter images of Tice's artworks and photos of the artist were featured in magazines such as ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]], Rogue, [[The Blind Man]],'' and ''[[Cartoons magazine]]''. During that time she had several one-person exhibitions and also worked on numerous other projects, for example, she created posters for bohemian costume balls and played herself in the 1922 version of the ''Greenwich Village Follies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=416–429|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Tice not only played an important part in Greenwich Village's colorful art scene, but also joined the Arensberg Circle in their uptown location. It was probably [[Marcel Duchamp]] who introduced Tice to Walter and Louise Arensberg and their salon. There she met [[Henri-Pierre Roché]], with whom she spent several evenings. Tice also participated in two projects by the Arensberg Circle: first, two of her works were shown in the first exhibition of the [[Society of Independent Artists]] and second, one of her works was featured in ''The Blind Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=425–427|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, she illustrated about a dozen books with her erotic images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=432–434|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are nowadays expensive collector's items. In 1940, her own book called ''ABC Dogs'' was published. It is a children's book in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a dog breed whose name starts with the same letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tice|first=Clara|title=ABC Dogs|year=1940|publisher=Funk|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication sparked renewed interest in Tice and her art. She also worked on her memoirs, which she never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the term in media studies|Concision (media studies)}}
{{Redirect|Succinct}}
'''Concision''' (alternatively '''brevity''', '''laconicism''', '''terseness''', or '''conciseness''') is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] without omitting important information. Concision has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing.&lt;ref name="tEoS"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related concept of '''succinctness''' is the opposite of [[verbosity]].

==Description==
Concision means to be economical with words, expressing what's needed using the fewest words necessary.&lt;ref name="Concision"&gt;"What is Concision?" Accessed February 4, 2017. [https://concision.co.uk/concision/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; That may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with shorter ones. It is described in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]] as follows:&lt;ref name="tEoS"/&gt;

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.|Elementary Principles of Composition, ''The Elements of Style''}}

Concision has also been described as "eliminat[ing] words that take up space without saying much."&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;Program for Writing and Rhetoric, University of Colorado at Boulder. "Writing Tip #27: Revising for Concision and Clarity." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.colorado.edu/pwr/writingtips/27.html Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples include replacing "{{sic|due to the fact that}}" with "because" or "at this point in time" with "now" or "currently."&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;UNT Writing Lab. "Concision, Clarity, and Cohesion." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.unt.edu/writinglab/UNTOWL_Concision_Clarity_and_Cohesion.pdf Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence, with explanation:&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;

{{quote|'''"It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, that is the audience, that the arguments are true."''' Notice the beginning of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a fact, just present it. So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce '''"Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers,"''' or a similarly straightforward expression.}}

==Example paragraph==
The following example is taken from:&lt;ref name="UNT"/&gt;

{{quote|The author of the poem illustrated various differences between the characters. The poem, which was a [[romantic poem]], showed that each individual character was sort of devious in the way in which he or she did things and behaved. The two characters in the poem, who were named Jim and Dwight, were never definitely and completely honest with each other, which led to the final outcome of them being unhappy. This outcome, which was undesirable, is designed in a way to show the readers just exactly how the author feels about lying and deceit.}}

The source suggests this replacement:

{{quote|The romantic poem showed that its characters were devious. Jim and Dwight, the poem’s two characters, were never honest with each other and ended up unhappy. This undesirable outcome shows the readers how the author feels about lying.}}

In the second quote, the same information is communicated in less than half the length. However, it could be more concisely rewritten and communicate the same information:

{{quote|The romantic poem’s characters, Jim and Dwight, were dishonest with each other and ended up unhappy, showing the author's feelings about lying.}}

==Teaching concise expression==
Concise expression, particularly in writing, is considered one of the basic goals of teaching the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Buczynski, Kristin Fontichiaro, ''Story Starters and Science Notebooking: Developing Student Thinking Through Literacy and Inquiry'' (2009), p. 7, {{ISBN|1591586860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques to achieve concise writing are taught for students at all levels, from the introduction to writing to the preparation of PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, ''Authoring a PhD: How to Plan, Draft, Write and Finish a Doctoral Thesis or Dissertation'' (2003), p. 273, {{ISBN|023036800X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal writing for law students.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Writing Institute, ''Legal Writing: The Journal of the Legal Writing Institute'' (2002), Vol. 7, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that although "in expository prose English places a high value on conciseness... [t]he value placed on conciseness... is not shared by all cultures", with, for example, the [[Thai culture]] as one where redundancy is prized as an opportunity to use additional words to demonstrate the writer's command of the language.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"&gt;Mark Newell Brock, Larry Walters, ''Teaching Composition Around the Pacific Rim: Politics and Pedagogy'' (1992), p. 4-5, {{ISBN|1853591602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to a tendency for people from those cultures to use repetitive or redundant phrasing when learning English.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"/&gt;

==Succinctness==
The related concept of '''succinctness''' is a characteristic of [[Plain language|speech]],&lt;ref name=Garner2009b&gt;{{cite book | last1=Garner| first1=Bryan A.| author1-link=Bryan A.

It is the opposite of verbosity, in which there is an excess of words.

Brevity in succinctness is not achieved by shortening original material by [[code|coding]] or [[Data compression|compressing]] it, but rather by omitting [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]] material from it.

In [[mathematics]], a '''cross-cap''' is a two-dimensional surface in 3-space that is one-sided and the continuous image of a [[Möbius strip]] that intersects itself in an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In the domain, the inverse image of this interval is a longer interval that the mapping into 3-space "folds in half". At the point where the longer interval is folded in half in the image, the nearby configuration is that of the [[Whitney umbrella]].  

The interval of self intersection precludes the cross-cap from being [[homeomorphic]] to the [[Möbius strip]], but there are only two points in the image (the endpoints of the interval of self-intersection) where the image cannot be that of an immersion. The bounding edge of a cross-cap is a simple closed loop. Like certain versions of the Möbius strip, it may take the form of a symmetrical [[circle]].

A cross-cap that has been closed up by gluing a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] to its boundary is a model of the [[real projective plane]] P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (again with an interval of self-intersection, and two points where this model is not an immersion of P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Two cross-caps glued together at their boundaries form a model of the [[Klein bottle]], this time with two intervals of self-intersection and four points where this model is not an immersion.

An important theorem of [[topology]], the [[classification theorem for surfaces]], states that each [[two-dimensional]] compact [[manifold]] without boundary is homeomorphic to a sphere with some number (possibly 0) of "handles" and 0, 1, or 2 cross-caps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41844">A '''cross-sex friendship''' is a [[platonic relationship]] between an unrelated [[men|man]] and [[women|woman]]. There are multiple types of cross-sex [[friendships]], all defined by whether or not each party has a romantic [[Attractiveness|attraction]] to each other, or perceives that the other is interested. A few theories have been developed to explain the existence of such friendships. Research has been done on why men and women initiate these relationships, how they are perceived by others, implications for children with cross-sex friendships, among others. Cross-sex friendships can also create problems for those involved if either or both have or ever had any romantic feelings for the other.

==Background==

From the 20th century and onwards, cross-sex friendships have become more prevalent, especially in the [[United States]]. These relationships play a large role in [[social relation]]s of both men and women. Cross-sex relationships can often be a cause of complications because of the potential for [[Romance (love)|romance]] or sexual interactions.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228351895_Relational_maintenance_in_cross-sex_friendships_characterized_by_different_types_of_romantic_intent_An_exploratory_study|title=Relational maintenance in cross-sex friendships characterized by different types of romantic intent: An exploratory study|author=Laura K. Guerrero|date=1 November 2005|work=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsour (2002) defines a cross-sex friendship as a “voluntary, non-familial, non-romantic, relationship between a female and a male in which both individuals label their association as a friendship”.&lt;ref name=monsour2002&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021394929086|title=Book Review: Women and Men as Friends: Relationships Across the Life Span in the 21st Century. Michael Monsour, Mahwah, NJ, Erlbaum (Series on Personal Relationships); 2002. 277 pp. ISBN 0-8058-3567-9. $27.50 (softcover) | doi=10.1023/A:1021394929086 | volume=47|journal=Sex Roles|pages=295–296|author=Bookwala Jamila|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just because these friendships are labeled as “non-romantic,” one cannot assume that there are no romantic or sexual undertones.

Guerrero and Chavez (2005) suggest that there are four types of cross-sex friendships: mutual romance, strictly platonic, desires romance, and rejects romance.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; In a “mutual romance” cross-sex friendship, one of the participants wants a romantic relationship with the other individual and believes that the other individual wants the same. In “strictly platonic” relationships, the individual believes that the other simply wants to be just platonic friends with no thought of romance. In a "desires romance" cross-sex friendship, one individual wants the friendship to become a romantic relationship but does not believe the other individual wants a romantic relationship. In a “rejects romance” cross-sex relationship, one individual does not want the relationship to turn romantic, but believes that their friend does.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; Each of these friendship styles are based on the goals and viewpoint of the individual. Other theories and research discuss the causes and benefits of cross-sex friendships.

==Major theories==

===Evolutionary theory===

Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) theorize that cross-sex friendships are a part of humans’ evolved [[Human mating strategies|mating strategies]]. Current mating strategies unconsciously motivate individuals to enter into cross-sex friendships because it gives them more opportunities to mate. As a result, individuals within these cross-sex friendships often develop attraction to the other individual, even when that attraction is completely unintended.&lt;ref name=bleske2012&gt;Bleske-Rechek, April et al. [http://bleske-rechek.com/April%20Website%20Files/Bleske-Rechek%20et%20al.%202012%20Benefit%20or%20Burden.pdf "Benefit or Burden? Attraction in cross-sex Friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[evolutionary theory]] predicts that cross-sex friendships are formed by males for sexual access and by females for protection.&lt;ref name="bleske2001"&gt;Bleske-Rechek, A. L. &amp; Buss, D. M.[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/busslab/pdffiles/opposite_sex_friendship2001.pdf "Opposite-Sex Friendship: Sex Differences and Similarities in Initiation, Selection, and Dissolution"], "[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates one way in which cross-sex friendships serve, in part, as a long term mating acquisition strategy. Having more opportunities to mate is an evolutionary advantage, however, being attracted to a cross-sex friend creates negative social consequences. This is especially true for younger adults who are attracted to a cross-sex friend, because these people report less satisfaction in their current romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Also, middle-aged adults tend to nominate attraction to their cross-sex friends as more of a negative than a positive.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

===Social learning theory===

In addition, [[social learning theory]] predicts that if cross-sex friendships are a result of the desire for sexual access and protection, this is because they are imitating other cross-sex friendships. Most popular television shows and movies suggest that the goal of forming cross-sex friendships is a romantic relationship. People learn from the friendships they see in [[popular culture]] and model their behavior after them.

Preference for same sex relationships is a societal norm that is taught to children from a young age. This homosocial norm encourages same sex friendships early on that shape how adolescents view and measure cross-sex friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Suzanna M.|title=Same- and cross-sex friendships and the psychology of homosociality|journal=Sex Roles|date=1985|volume=12|issue=1–2|doi=10.1007/bf00288037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally supported rules about friendships and gender influence the formation of interpersonal relationships. For this reason, ideas of cross-sex friendship can vary from place to place. While diverse cultures view relationships across genders differently, studies have shown that similar ideals for friendship seem to exist around the world in areas such as the United States, Europe, and East Asia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felmlee|first1=Diane|last2=Sweet|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Sinclair|first3=H. Colleen|title=Gender Rules: Same- and Cross-Gender Friendships Norms|journal=Sex Roles|date=2012|volume=66|issue=7–8|pages=518–529|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, adolescent definitions of cross-sex friendships closely match definitions given by adults, suggesting that children develop perceptions on the matter by imitating the opinions of adults in their lives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=Jennifer|last2=Craig|first2=Wendy|last3=Goldberg|first3=Adele|last4=Pepler|first4=Debra|title=Conceptions of Cross-Sex Friendships and Romantic Relationships in Early Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=1999|volume=28|issue=4|pages=481–494|doi=10.1023/a:1021669024820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During adolescence, a distinction starts to form between romantic relationships and platonic friendships, which is influenced by personal experience as well as exposure to media and popular culture. Teenagers learn from portrayals of romance on television and base their own relationships on these representations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Popular media romanticizes and sexualizes interactions between people of opposite sexes, leading to a cultural expectation of sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships. This common conception leads a small percentage of the population to believe that men and women cannot exist in solely platonic friendships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The glass partition===

Kim Elsesser and Letitia Anne Peplau found that the professional workplace environment and heightened [[sexual harassment]] awareness can hinder cross-sex friendship formation.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu"&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The barrier between men and women forming cross-sex friendships in the professional workplace is called the "glass partition" because of its similarities to the [[glass ceiling]], which prevents women from reaching the top levels of leadership of corporations. The glass partition disadvantages women who work in predominantly male workplaces because women have fewer opportunities for networking. The glass partition results from fearing that friendliness toward a cross-sex friend will be misinterpreted by the friend and by co-workers as romantic or sexual interest, that humor may be perceived as sexual harassment by cross-sex friends, and that conversational topics might be perceived as offensive by cross-sex friends.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu"/&gt;

When coworkers or other third parties see a cross-sex friendship in the workplace as romantic, this relationship is often viewed negatively, hurting both the male and female worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoke|first1=Haley|title=Throwing Stones At The Glass Partition: Responses To Coworkers Cross-Sex Workplace Friendships|journal=European Journal of Management|date=2015|volume=15|issue=2|pages=85–96|doi=10.18374/ejm-15-2.5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rebecca_Chory/publication/282588300_Throwing_stones_at_the_glass_partition_Responses_to_coworkers'_cross-sex_workplace_friendships/links/5787c1b808aedc252a9368ad.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern becomes specifically prevalent when dealing with cross-sex friendships between superiors and subordinates. It is more likely that this relationship can be misconstrued as often the subordinate, usually a female, might be seen as trying to make advances in order to further their career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|journal=Human Relations|date=2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual harassment can hinder the development of cross-sex friendships as well. It is typical practice in companies and organizations to have policies against sexual harassment and to conduct trainings regarding sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winstead|first1=BA|title=Gender and relationships at Work|journal=Friends and Enemies in Organizations|date=2009|pages=139–167|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37468344/Enemies_and_Friends_in_Organisation.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1510091424&amp;Signature=3oy2mRUJLQK2PkvpxdSRgRjLoEM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRelational_Atmospheres_-_Organisational.pdf#page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this heightened awareness of sexual harassment occurrences, many individuals will step back from cross-sex friendships as they can sometimes be misinterpreted by the opposite sex individual or bystanders as sexual harassment. In the study conducted by Elsesser and Peplau, it was stated that most men interviewed in their study often think over conversation topics before initiating conversation with women coworkers, in fear that their comments would be misinterpreted as sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|date=August 2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|journal=Human Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of such wrong accusations, many would rather avoid the possibility of such a situation through avoiding the development of cross-sex friendships as opposed to deal with the possible misconceptions.

Furthermore, it has been reported that oftentimes for men, there is a fear of offending the opposite sex regarding certain conversation topics. For instance, a male management consultant interviewed by Elsesser and Peplau stated that he commonly segregates by gender what type of jokes or humor he expresses in the workplace in fear that it might offend a female coworker.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; On the contrary, women often say that while they do not feel as though they censor their conversation as much, they can often sense such reservations and unwillingness to relax in men, making friendships awkward and harder to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|journal=Human relations|date=2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fear to create cross-sex friendships in the workplace becomes a problem as friendships amongst coworkers can be specifically important for career development. Friendships can provide information access, networking and emotional support to any individual all of which are valuable for job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kram|first1=Kathy|last2=Lynne|first2=Isabella|title=Mentoring Alternatives: The Role Of Peer Relationships In Career Development|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=1985|volume=28|issue=1|pages=110–132|doi=10.2307/256064|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=KE&amp;aulast=Kram&amp;atitle=Mentoring+alternatives:+The+role+of+peer+relationships+in+career+development&amp;id=doi:10.2307/256064&amp;title=Proceedings+-+Academy+of+Management&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=1&amp;date=1985&amp;spage=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, when one is limited to forming friendships with those of the same sex, certainly, they are being deprived of advancement in the workplace. Thus, effort should be put into creating workplace environments where cross-sex friendships can be formed with less question or fear.

==Major empirical findings==

Research has been done in the areas of attraction, protection, perception, cross-sex friendships throughout development, and touch and sexual activity between cross-sex friends. These studies find that there are some evolutionary and social benefits to cross-sex friendships. However, there are also some negative social consequences.

===Attraction===

Within cross-sex friendships, men judge sexual attraction and the desire for sex as a more important reason than do women for initiating their friendship. Additionally, men are more sexually attracted to their opposite-sex friends and have more frequent desires to have sexual intercourse with their opposite-sex friends than women are.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) found that men overestimate how much their female friends are attracted to them. Women are less likely to want to date their male friends if he is in a committed relationship, but men have the same desire to date their female friend whether or not she is dating someone.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) hypothesize that a man’s desire to date his female friend is not changed by whether or not their female friend is in a relationship. This is due to males’ mating strategies that focus around acquiring short term mates.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Furthermore, Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) suggest that men would pursue cross-sex relationships both when single and in a relationship, while women would be less likely to pursue cross-sex friends while dating someone.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

Attraction within these friendships can cause challenges. Sexual attraction can arise for a variety of reasons in cross-sex friendships. In a study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009), participants cited social pressures and emotional vulnerability as reasons for sexual attraction arising in a cross-sex friendship.&lt;ref name=halatsis&gt;Halatsis, P. &amp; Christakis, N. [http://spr.sagepub.com/content/26/6-7/919.abstract "The challenge of sexual attraction within heterosexual's cross-sex friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A social pressure that may prompt sexual attraction between cross-sex friends is the perceptions other friends have of their relationship and emotional vulnerability coupled with closeness may provoke sexual attraction between cross-sex friends. When sexual attraction develops in a friendship, it can corrupt the friendship and individuals state that behavior often changes. Sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships is often dealt with in one of three ways: management of this attraction through communication or an internal decision not to pursue the attraction in order to preserve the friendship, a sexual relationship forms then dissipates, or sex becomes a part of the friendship.&lt;ref name=halatsis/&gt; When participants in the study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009) were asked about their experience with sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships, over 50% had experienced attraction, and over 50% of that group had expressed or acted on their sexual attraction. However, men had a tendency to be more attracted to their cross-sex friends, and a higher tendency to act on that attraction. Only 16% of individuals who had acted on their sexual attraction claimed that their friendship ended as a result, otherwise the friendship remained intact or transformed into a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=halatsis/&gt;  
Reeder (2000) found that there are four types of attraction within cross-sex friendships: subjective physical/sexual attraction, objective physical/sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and friendship attraction.&lt;ref name=reeder2000&gt;Reeder, H. [https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/85933/jspr-reeder.pdf "I like you...as a friend: The role of attraction in cross-sex friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective physical/sexual attraction occurs when one of the individuals in the friendship is physically attracted to the other. Objective physical/sexual attraction happens when one individual thinks that the other is attractive in general, yet they are not attracted to the person. Romantic attraction within the cross-sex friendship occurs when one of the individuals within the friendship desires to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship because they believe he or she would make a good girlfriend or boyfriend. Friendship attraction is simply when an individual feels very platonically connected to his or her friend.&lt;ref name=reeder2000/&gt; The four types can coexist together within a friendship or can occur separately. Furthermore, the type of attraction that an individual feels within a cross-sex friendship can change over time. Within Reeder’s (2000) sample, friendship attraction is the most prevalent type of attraction within cross-sex friendships. Even when participants felt other types of attraction within their cross-sex friendships, they prioritized their friendship attraction so that they relationship would not be ruined.&lt;ref name=reeder2000/&gt;

===Protection===

Historically, women are more vulnerable due to their smaller stature and lesser strength compared with men. Thus, women have consistently needed to secure protection for themselves.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Seeking protection from men would have been an evolutionary advantage as women who do so increase their reproductive success, which has caused an evolved preference for men who are willing and able to offer protection.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Therefore, it is not surprising that Bleske-Rechek &amp; Buss (2001) found that women judged physical protection as a more important reason for initiating an opposite-sex friendship than did men and that opposite-sex friendship is a strategy women use for gaining physical protection.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt;

In this regard, males have historically been perceived as having an advantage in cross-sex friendships because the number of resources they have to offer in the relationship exceeds those of females (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of exchange principles within the friendship, women would benefit more than men (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While women may enter into cross-sex friendships for protection, men may enter them for the possibility of sexual encounters (Akbulut and Weger 100).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akbulut|first=Valerie|last2=Jr|first2=Harry Weger|date=2016-01-02|title=Predicting Responses to Bids for Sexual and Romantic Escalation in Cross-Sex Friendships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2015.1066296|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=156|issue=1|pages=98–114|doi=10.1080/00224545.2015.1066296|issn=0022-4545|pmid=26133674}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions are desirable because men get to spread their genes through potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 100).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In return, females can benefit from this type of cross-sex friendship through their friend’s interest in potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 101).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this regard, the men within these cross-sex friendships would devote time and energy to caring for and protecting their potential children, which would be beneficial to the females in these relationships (Akbulut and Weger 101).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, in cross-sex friendships, it has been discovered that males are commonly the ones more interested in initiating romantic relationships due to their potential benefits, as observed in a survey of male and female college students (Akbulut and Weger 110).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Perception===

The way in which other individuals perceive cross-sex friends can affect the friendship itself. Cross-sex friends sometimes face the audience challenge within their [[social group]]s, which occurs when other people assume that they are in a romantic or sexual relationship and the cross-sex friends have to present themselves as just friends in response.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014&gt;Schoonover, K. and McEwan, B. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12040/abstract, "Are you really just friends? Predicting the audience challenge in cross-sex friendships"], "[[Personal Relationships]]", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoonover and McEwan (2014) state that since male-female romantic relationships are the norm, people often assume that cross-sex friendships have the potential to develop into a more intimate relationship.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; The different types of cross-sex friendships will experience the audience challenge in different ways. Strictly platonic friends are least likely to bring about the audience challenge, while mutual romance are the most likely to face the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; The number of cross-sex friends an individual has also plays a role in how their cross-sex friendships are perceived. When an individual has numerous cross-sex friendships, they are much less likely to face the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt;

Regardless of the severity of the audience challenge, those in cross-sex friendships have been found to spend a considerable amount of time thinking about how their relationship is perceived by others, according to the results of a study that surveyed young adults in cross-sex friendships (Schoonover and McEwan 399).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; If the peers within their social network of friends want or believe that the cross-sex friendship is romantic, issues could potentially arise in other relationships (Schoonover and McEwan 389).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; For example, if either member of the friendship has a romantic partner, that person could become jealous or suspicious, which could create tension and destroy the cross-sex friendship (Schoonover and McEwan 389).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; Therefore, the surrounding social network’s opinions of the cross-sex friendship can change the degree that the friends have to worry about the audience challenge (Schoonover and McEwan 391).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; In other words, as the network’s support of the cross-sex friendship as a strictly platonic relationship increases, the audience challenge decreases (Schoonover and McEwan 401).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; However, while the audience challenge can be a problematic issue for certain types of cross-sex friendships, it has found to not be commonly experienced within cross-sex friendships at large (Schoonover and McEwan 394).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; One of the main attributes to this finding was that members of the cross-sex friendships were able to effectively communicate with each other as well as their social network about the nature of their relationship and how they were being perceived (Monsour et al. 75).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monsour|first=Michael|last2=Harris|first2=Bridgid|date=July 1994|title=Challenges Confronting Cross-Sex Friendships: "Much Ado about Nothing?"|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=31|pages=55–77|via=|doi=10.1007/bf01560277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children’s and adolescent’s cross-sex friendships===

Cross-sex friendships in [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]] often have an immense impact on adult cross-sex friendships. Successfully forming cross-sex friendships in childhood is often an indication that these individuals will be able to form positive cross-sex friendships later in life. Thus, early cross-sex friendships act as a blueprint for further social interactions.&lt;ref name=monsour2002/&gt; Children’s [[social skills]] and [[behavior]] can be altered based on whether or not they have predominantly same-sex friends or cross-sex friends. One study by Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman (1996), they found that children who primarily had friends of the opposite sex were perceived to be more aggressive, yet less shy by others.&lt;ref name=kovacs1996&gt;Kovacs, D. M., Parker, J. G., &amp; Hoffman, L. W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022241 "Behavioral, Affective, and Social Correlates of Involvement in Cross‐Sex Friendship in Elementary School"], "[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]", 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, teachers said that the children with primarily friends of the opposite sex had lower academic performance and social skills, however faced less stereotyping in regards to gender roles and were better adjusted to their social atmosphere than children with few friends in general. Results from Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman’s (1996) study show that children who have a best friend that is the opposite sex have poorer social functioning abilities. Yet, when children have friends primarily of the same sex, but some cross-sex friendships, they tend to be more well-adjusted and have stronger social skills.&lt;ref name=kovacs1996/&gt; Additional studies conducted by Bell and Kalmijn oppose these negative observations behind cross-sex friendships in children, concluding that cross-sex friendships help children overcome communication barriers with the opposite sex, granting them an advantage with their social and communication skills later on. Their studies also observed that cross-sex friendships in children incorporate stronger senses of nurturance and intimacy that lack in same-sex friendships.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1981 in Traustadottir, 2004, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-sex friendships in adolescence are very different than in childhood. In adolescence, cross-sex friendships are not only more accepted by peers, but also can increase an individual's social status among same-sex peers.&lt;ref name=winstead1997&gt;Winstead, B. A., Derlega, V. J., &amp; Rose, S. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01165.x/abstract "Gender and Close Relationships: An Introduction"], "[[Journal of Social Issues]]", 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on adolescents in 6th through 8th grade conducted by Malow-Iroff (2006) discovered that adolescents often use the creation of cross-sex friends as a road to popularity because children with both cross-sex and same-sex friends are more accepted by both sexes.&lt;ref name=malow2006&gt;Malow-Iroff, M. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16916075 "cross-sex Best Friendship Influences on Early Adolescent Cigarette and Alcohol Expectancies and Use"], "[[The Journal of Psychology]]", 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents mainly look for cross-sex friends who are sociable, as they expect less from these friendships as they do from same-sex friends.&lt;ref name=winstead1997/&gt; Another study by Ami Flam Kuttler, Annette M. La Greca, and Mitchell J Prinstein surveyed 223 students from grades 10 through 12. The study concluded that although the number of cross-sex friendships in adolescents increase with age, both girls and boys felt a sense of stronger companionship and prosocial support with their friends of the same sex. However, adolescent boys claimed they felt as if their female companions provide support in regards to [[self-esteem]] more so than males. In addition to these findings, the study concluded that adolescents with predominately cross-sex friendships at these ages is perceived in relation to a lower social acceptance, rather than attaining to social or behavioral complications as observed in children through middle childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glickman | first1 = Alissa R. | last2 = La Greca | first2 = Annette M. | year = 2004 | title = The Dating Anxiety Scale for Adolescents: Scale Development and Associations With Adolescent Functioning | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 566–578 | doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp3303_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch and sexual activity in cross-sex friendships===

In cross-sex friendships, Miller, Denes, Diaz, and Ranjit (2014) found that when men believe the friendship to be strictly platonic, they are more open to touching their friend. However, when they think intimacy may be increasing in the relationship, they are less like to desire casual touching.&lt;ref name=miller2014&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12033/abstract|title=Touch attitudes in cross-sex friendships: We're just friends | doi=10.1111/pere.12033 | volume=21|journal=Personal Relationships|pages=309–323|author=Miller Michael J|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the opposite was discovered to be true when it comes to women. Miller et al. (2014), found that women report being more uncomfortable if touched by their cross-sex friend in a public situation than men did.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt; When there is touch between cross-sex friends, no matter how much intimacy is involved in the friendship, men tend to be more aroused by the touch than women are.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt; The researchers hypothesize that the research results may have been confounded by a [[social desirability bias]] because women may be less likely to admit arousal from the touch of a cross-sex friend out of fear of being negatively labeled by others.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt;

Afifi and Faulkner (2000) investigated instances in which individuals had sexual interactions with their platonic cross-sex friends. 51% of their sample had sex with their friend when they had no intention of pursuing a romantic relationship with them, and 34% of participants noted having sexual relations with their friend on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=afifi2000&gt;Afifi, W. &amp; Faulkner, S. [http://spr.sagepub.com/content/17/2/205.short "On Being 'Just Friends': The Frequency and Impact of Sexual Activity in cross-sex Friendships"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Afifi &amp; Faulkner’s study, of those who had sex with their friend, two-thirds stated that it improved their relationship and 56% stated that the relationship did not develop into something romantic.&lt;ref name=afifi2000/&gt;

Sexual interactions are recognized as a possible outcome of cross-sex friendships because societal expectations have conditioned males and females to view each other as potential sexual partners (Monsour et al. 56).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the face of these sexual overtones, some welcome the sexual tension in their cross-sex friendship while others note that the potential intimacy could destroy their relationship (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the sexual component, some friends are hesitant to enter into romantic relationships due to the anticipated disapproval of their social network of peers (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Cross-sex friends often have overlapping social circles (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each member in the cross-sex friendship depends on their social network for support and other emotional needs (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, potentially falling out of touch with members of one’s own social network if the romantic relationship did not work out, is too costly for some cross-sex friends, even if they have engaged in sexual interactions (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Nature/nurture==

The biological basis for cross-sex relationships cannot be found in ancient human history, because the way humans conducted their lives is different from the way current humans do now. Up until 10,000 years ago, or for over 99% of homo history, humans’ ancestors lived their lives in a nomadic fashion, foraging in groups structured by reproductive partners and offspring — not unlike the way families are organized current-day.&lt;ref name=chagnon1992&gt;http://www.saexplorers.org/system/files/magazine/sae-mag-43j-books.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Females began reproducing at an early age, and males practiced behaviors that showcased ownership over their female partners in order to safeguard them from other males. There have only been scattered ethnographic references to cross-sex friendships across cultures.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Therefore, for much of ancient human history, cross-sex friendships were not common. Today, men and women interact in non-romantic, supportive ways in all types of contexts: work, sports, education, and hobbies, yet these unions are not based on  sexual intentions. Evolved mating strategies were mentioned earlier and can be dovetailed with this biological history.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

==Controversies==

Participants in cross-sex friendships face many challenges, including learning how to navigate the particular type of friendship. The four types of cross-sex friendship as defined by Guerrero and Chavez (2005) referenced earlier are: strictly platonic, mutual romance, desires romance, and rejects romance.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; In addition, O’Meara (1989) originally stated that the four essential challenges cross-sex friends face are: 1) determining the type of emotional bond experienced in the relationship, 2) confronting the issue of sexuality, 3) dealing with the issue of relationship equality within a cultural context of gender inequality, and 4) the challenge of public relationships — presenting the relationship as authentic to relevant audiences.&lt;ref name=omeara1989&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00289102#page-1|title=cross-sex friendship: Four basic challenges of an ignored relationship | doi=10.1007/BF00289102 | volume=21|journal=Sex Roles|pages=525–543|author=O'Meara J. Donald|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnoonover (2014) built research upon O’Meara’s audience challenge and found that members of Guerrero and Chavez’s (2005) different friendship types may experience challenges differently.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; For example, for “mutual romance” couples, members may be approaching the preliminary romantic stage of the relationship and if their romantic feelings feed into their behaviors toward each other, then they will be the most likely to be mistaken for a romantic couple. In contrast, “strictly platonic” friends should be the least likely the prompt the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; “Desires romance” and “rejects romance” couples may also be subject to the audience challenge — if observers of the friendship see the member acting in a romantic manner or admitting romantic intent, the observers might be more likely to regard the cross-sex friendship as a growing romantic relationship more so than a friendship.

Another controversial question surrounding cross-sex friendships that is often raised is - after two romantic partners end their relationship — or more colloquially, “break up” — can they still be platonic friends? Kenny and Schneider (2000) found three major conclusions about cross-sex friendship with a romantic history.&lt;ref name=kenny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spr.sagepub.com/content/17/3/451.abstract|title=cross-sex Friends Who were Once Romantic Partners: Are they Platonic Friends Now?|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, rebranding a discontinued romantic relationship as a friendship is common in modern American culture. Second, there are particular predictors of whether a friendship will occur after romance. One critical factor is whether there was a platonic friendship before the romantic relationship existed. Because the partners knew how to navigate friendship with each other before romance, they were more likely to be friends afterwards. Third, the atmosphere in which the breakup occurred determined the likelihood of a post-friendship.&lt;ref name=kenny/&gt; Kenny and Schneider (2000) cited evidence noting that a more significant indicator of an upcoming friendship is the communication in which the breakup occurred, not the individual who first initiated the breakup.&lt;ref name=kenny/&gt;

When looking at how men and women’s same sex relationships work, men tend to talk about more of their problems and open up more with women, rather than their other male friendships which tends to facilitate a bit of a gray area of what is expected when a man and a women are friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apter|first1=Terri|title=Do Cross-Gender Friendships Always Have a Sexual Element?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/domestic-intelligence/200811/do-cross-gender-friendships-always-have-sexual-element|website=Psychology Today|publisher=HealthProfs|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-sex friendship can exist after marriage when the married couple transition out of the passionate phase. Original feelings while dating are feelings of passion and what many describe as love, however as the relationship progresses through the years and into marriage, studies have found these feelings to be diminished and transition into more of a friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Cassandra|title=Founding Friendships: Friendships between Men and Women in the Early Republic.|journal=The Journal of Social History|date=June 2017|volume=50|issue=4|pages=727–729|doi=10.1093/jsh/shw060|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jsh/shw060|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a topic of controversy as some argue it cannot be labeled as a cross sex “friendship” but rather a romantic relationship, however a study by Alan Booth and Elaine Hess (1974) dictates that almost all cross sex friendships can have some sexual/romantic influence, however it does not discount the friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Booth|first1=Alan|last2=Hess|first2=Elaine|title=Cross Sex Friendship|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=Feb 1974|volume=36|issue=1|pages=38–47|doi=10.2307/350992|jstor=350992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The “friend zone” has also focused on the argument that two people of opposite sexes can never be friends, and many saying that no friendship can occur after one party has made it evident that they have romantic feelings for the other. This coincides with questions on if the parties involved can have had or currently have romantic feelings for one another, or if a friendship must be based on solely feelings of platonic friendship for the duration of the friendship. The definition of a cross-sex friendship that J. Donald O'Meara (1989) gives is a relationship between a man and a woman that is not primarily focused on romance, but is not always void of romantic feelings, meaning that once one party had been in the “friend zone” as long as the relationship is primarily aimed towards a friendship, it is still a cross-sex friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Meara|first1=Donald|title=Cross-sex friendship: Four basic challenges of an ignored relationship|journal=Journal of Research on Sex Roles|date=October 1989|volume=21|issue=7–8|pages=525–543|doi=10.1007/BF00289102|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00289102|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in child development psychology, more specifically a study done by Donna M. Kovacs, Jeffrey G. Parker and Lois W. Hoffman (1996) looked into children’s cross sex friendships, and found an absence of these types of friendships at younger ages. This raised cause for concern within the study as the researchers discussed how this could be due to a greater separation of genders at younger ages, which can reinforce societal defined gender roles, and prevent these types of friendships, which can be beneficial to development from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovacs|first1=Donna|last2=Parker|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Hoffman|first3=Lois|title=Behavioral, Affective, and Social Correlates of Involvement in Cross-Sex Friendship in Elementary School|journal=Society for Research in Child Development|date=October 1996|volume=67|issue=5|pages=2269–2286|doi=10.2307/1131622|jstor=1131622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''Cue recruitment''' is a form of [[associative learning]] in [[human]] [[perception]].  A ''cue'' in perception is a [[Wiktionary:signal|signal]] that can be measured by an observer's perceptual system, that is informative about the state of some property of the world.  A ''trusted cue'' is one that the system utilizes to construct [[Visual appearance|appearance]], i.e. to build a [[percept]] (what one "sees") that depends on the world state.  In a ''cue recruitment experiment'', an arbitrarily chosen signal is put into [[correlation]] with trusted cues, which makes the signal into an artificial cue.  If the artificial cue acquires the ability to affect appearance in a manner similar to the trusted cues, it is said to have been ''recruited''.

The cue recruitment experiment is a form of [[classical conditioning]] experiment, the simplest test for [[associative learning]] in which one (or at most a few) new signal(s) are put into correlation with one or a few trusted cues.  Cue recruitment (a change in perceptual appearance) does not always occur during a cue recruitment experiment.

Perceptually bistable stimuli are often used to test for cue recruitment because they allow the experimenter to measure very small cue-contingent biases in appearance.  Bistable stimuli are useful for a second reason as well: trainees can easily report appearance for these stimuli.  As a result, if learning occurs during the experiment, the experimenter can be sure that the learning caused a change in how the stimulus looked, rather than a change in the explicit strategy used by the trainee during responding.

Cue recruitment is one of many types of ''cue learning'', a more general framework due to [[Egon Brunswik]] that also encompasses other [[adaptation|adaptive]] changes in the system's use of cues.  Examples of cue learning that are not cue recruitment include:
*''Cue weighting''.  When two or more trusted cues are available to estimate the same property of the world, human perceptual systems usually exhibit [[data fusion]], and it is possible to change the relative weights given to different cues through training (Ernst et al., 2000).  
*''Pattern learning''.  A complex pattern of signals can be learned to act as a cue that affects appearance (Sinha &amp; Poggio, 1996).
*''Recalibration''.  The way that a particular cue is utilized can be modified by experience (Adams et al., 2001).

== Example ==

Cue recruitment was demonstrated by Haijiang et al. (2006) using a computer-generated rotating [[Necker cube]] stimulus.  This stimulus is perceptually bistable and may appear to rotate either left or right.  To test for cue recruitment, binocular disparity cues (3D cues) were added to the Necker cube, to specify which part of the cube was in front and which was in back.  The apparent direction of rotation was thereby brought under experimenter control.  The new cue was that the cube moved upward or downward on every trial (contingent on its direction of rotation).  Test trials contained the new cue but not the trusted cue.  On these trials, trainees tended to see the cube rotating in the same direction it had during training (depending on whether its motion was upward or downward).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16555">'''Embryo donation''' is a form of [[third party reproduction]]. It is defined as the giving—generally without compensation—of [[embryos]] remaining after one couple's [[in vitro fertilisation]] to either another person or couple for implantation or to research. Where it is given for the purpose of implantation, the donation is followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman's uterus to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth in the recipient. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor. This is the same principle as is followed in [[egg donation]] or [[sperm donation]]. Most often, the embryos are donated after the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term.

==For implantation==
Embryo donation can be handled on an anonymous basis (donor and recipient parties are not known to each other), or on an open basis (parties' identities are shared and the families agree to a relationship). Occasionally, a "semi-open" arrangement is used in which the parties know family and other information about each other, but their real names and locating information are withheld, in order to provide a layer of privacy protection.

=== Embryo donation or adoption ===

Some writers use the term "embryo donation" to refer strictly to anonymous embryo donation, and "embryo adoption" to refer to the open process.&lt;ref&gt;Snowflake Program, Nightlight Christian Adoptions&lt;/ref&gt; Others use the terms synonymously because regardless of whether the arrangement is open or anonymous, the donation of embryos and a clinical assisted reproduction procedure is involved, and the recipient couple is preparing to raise a child not genetically related to them.&lt;ref&gt;National Embryo Donation Center&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who assist couples who are trying to acquire an embryo state the term "embryo adoption" is a misnomer because the transfer of an embryo is handled as property transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Charles P. Kindregan &amp; Maureen McBrien}}, {{smallcaps|Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Lawyer's Guide to Emerging Law and Science}} 109-10 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Rob Blackhurst}}, ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10353338/The-pro-lifers-adopting-spare-embryos-created-during-IVF.html The pro-lifers adopting 'spare' embryos created during IVF]'', {{smallcaps|Telegraph (London)}}, Oct. 8, 2013 (hereinafter cited as Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Wetzstein, ''[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/19/embryo-adoption-becoming-rage/?page=all#pagebreak Embryo adoption becoming the rage]'', {{smallcaps|Wash.

=== Donor options ===

According to a survey by the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]], 54% of fertility patients want to preserve their remaining embryos for future use.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Another 21% want to donate leftover embryos for research.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Pamela Brown ''[http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/05/controversial-embryo-adoptions-on-the-rise--75501.html Controversial embryo adoptions on the rise]''  May 1, 2012 WJLA.COM&lt;/ref&gt; Donating embryos for research may be a good alternative when patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research project, the procedures and the scientific value of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Dr. Jeffrey Nelson is Director of the Huntington Reproductive Center, one of California's largest IVF clinics. He reports that "Twenty-five per cent of patients want to donate their [spare] embryos – not as many as I'd like." He added, "People tend to hold on to their embryos because they don't want to make a decision. We started buying more and more cryopreservation tanks, and we finally had to say that there's a fee for a certain number of years' storage, and beyond that the price starts to escalate."&lt;ref name="Blackhurst, Pro-lifers"&gt;Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It costs up to $1,200 a year to store frozen embryos.&lt;ref&gt;Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers''&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2012, there were about 600,000 frozen embryos stored in laboratories and fertility clinics,&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; costing the donor families about $72 million annually for storage fees.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Young ''[http://www.nightlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Loveland-Reporter-Herald-Article.pdf Funding cut threatens Loveland-based program that encourages adoption of frozen embryos; women tell adoption stories]''  March 10, 2012 {{smallcaps|Loveland Reporter-Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donor screening ===

In the United States, donors must, if possible, be screened for a series of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/TissueTissueProducts/QuestionsaboutTissues/ucm136397.htmhttp://www.miracleswaiting.org/explorembryo.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) administers the rules for screening donors. If the donors are not available to be screened, the embryos must be given a label that indicates that the required screening has not been done, and the recipients must agree to accept the associated risk. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own embryologist conduct further testing.

or donating them for use in [[embryonic stem cell research]]. Although embryos can, theoretically, survive indefinitely in frozen storage, as a practical reality someone must eventually decide on a permanent disposition for them.

A US study concluded that donating an embryo is approximately twice as cost-effective as [[oocyte]] donation in terms of cost per live birth, with a cost of $22,000 per live delivery compared to $41,000 for oocyte donation.

=== History ===

Soon after [[in vitro fertilization]] became a common clinical practice, clinicians discovered a way to [[cryopreserve|preserve]] embryos in frozen storage and thaw them for implantation later. This procedure can spare a woman donor from a second egg harvesting procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Trounson A, Freemann L. The use of embryo cryopreservation in human IVF programmes. Clin Obstet Gynaecol 1985 Dec;12(4):825-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downing BG, Mohr LR, Trounson AO, Freemann LE, Wood C. Birth After Transfer of Cryopreserved Embryos. Med J Aust 1985 Apr 1;142(7):409-11&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, clinicians reasoned that more couples could be helped toward parenthood by substituting donor sperm for men who have no viable sperm, or donor eggs for women who have no viable oocytes – or both. Thus what was called gamete and embryo donation, came into being. A careful reading of the 1983 clinical report often cited as the first instance of embryo donation  reveals that the donated embryo was actually created for the recipient at the same time that four embryos were made for the donor couple's own use.  The menstrual cycles of the donor and recipient women were synchronized using medications, and the transfers occurred on the same day. None of these embryos had been cryopreserved.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Soon thereafter, reports were published documenting successful pregnancies and births from cryopreserved donor embryos. Again, however, these were embryos made from donor gametes specifically for the recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sauer | first1 = MV | last2 = Paulson | first2 = RJ | date = Nov 1990 | title = Human Oocyte and Preembryo Donation: an Evolving Method for the Treatment of Infertility | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 163 | issue = 5| pages = 1421–1424 | doi=10.1016/0002-9378(90)90599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Steirteghem | first1 = AC | last2 = Van den Abbeel | first2 = E | last3 = Braeckmans | first3 = P | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1987 | title = Pregnancy With a Frozen-thawed Embryo in a Woman With Primary Ovarian Failure | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 317 | issue = | page = 113 | doi=10.1056/nejm198707093170210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one knows for sure when the first true embryo adoption occurred. The term was used as early as the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson JA. Embryos, Families, and Procreative Liberty: the Legal Structure of the New Reproduction. Southern California Law Review. 1986. 59: 939-1041&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wurmbrand MJ. Frozen embryos: moral, social, and legal implications. South Calif Law Rev 1986 Jul;59(5):1079-1100&lt;/ref&gt;  in the legal literature. Devroey et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Devroey P, Camus M, van den Abbeel E, van Waesberghe L, Wisanto A, van Steirteghem AC. Establishment of 22 Pregnancies After Oocyte and Embryo Donation. Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1989 Aug;96(8):900-906&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Maria Bustillo in Florida, and Dr. Howard Jones in Virginia have reported embryo transfers occurring between 1986 and 1990 that clearly represented adoption of remaining embryos.

Prior to this, thousands of women who were [[Infertility|infertile]] had regarded adoption as the only available path to parenthood. These scientific advances set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer as a solution to infertility.  In some ways, it is similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations.  Some see the embryo as "tissue", others see it as a "gift of a potential life",&lt;ref&gt;National Embryo Donation Center:  Questionnaire Study of Prospective Embryo Donors&lt;/ref&gt; while still others believe that a new human life begins at the time of fertilization.  The third group sees embryo donation as little different from traditional adoption, except that the recipient woman has the experience of pregnancy and childbirth, and that no court action is required to establish legal parentage for the recipient.

The matter gained another political dimension in the [[United States]] when Congress and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] budgeted $1 million to promote embryo adoption.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. President Discusses Stem Cell Research. Office of the Press Secretary, August 9, 2001. https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

Embryo donation is legally considered a property transfer and not an adoption by state laws. However, Georgia enacted a statute called the "Option of Adoption Act" in 2009 which provided a procedure for, but (importantly) did not require—a confirmatory court order of parentage following embryo adoption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/archive/20665/&lt;/ref&gt;  One advantage some embryo adoption couples in Georgia have derived from this law is that they have become eligible for the federal Adoption Tax Credit.

Embryo donation can be carried out as a service of an individual infertility clinic (where donor and recipient families typically live in the local area and are both patients of the same clinic) or by any of several national organizations. The process described below is typical of an "adoption-agency-based" national program.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Genetic parents entering an embryo adoption program are offered the benefits of selecting the adoptive parents from the agency's pool of prescreened applicants. Embryo ownership is transferred directly from the genetic parents to the adoptive parents. Genetic parents may be updated by the agency when a successful pregnancy is achieved and when a child(ren) is/are born. The genetic parents and adoptive parents may negotiate their own terms for future contact between the families.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Prospective adoptive parents entering a program complete an application,  and may also complete a traditional [[adoption home study]], fertility or adoption education, background and health checks and in some cases, depending on the requirements of both the home study and placement agencies, court certification of adoption eligibility. Their completed paperwork and fees are submitted to the placement agency, which reviews their file. Some agencies allow the donors to choose the recipient while others match the recipient parents with similar preferences including desired level of openness post-adoption. Genetic and prospective parents are then given the chance to approve the match. Once all parties agree, the embryo is transferred to the adoptive mother's clinic for a frozen embryo transfer.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

None of the procedures involved with embryo adoption by either the genetic or adopting parents are legal requirements of embryo transfer. The process is entered into willingly by both sets of parents because of the added safeguards, knowledge and communication offered to both parties by the system.&lt;ref&gt;Embryo Adoption &amp; Donation&lt;/ref&gt;

==For research==
Embryo donation to research provides a major source of [[stem cells]] for [[stem cell research]]. The hope is that stem cell research will aid in finding cures for various major diseases such as [[Alzheimer]], [[cancer]], [[Spinal muscular atrophy|SMA]], and [[Parkinson's]] diseases.  Some stem cell research is done by using human embryos, and one option that parents have once they are done with [[In vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] is to donate their unused embryos to stem cell research. One review came to the result that the proportion of IVF users who donated embryos for research varied geographically, from 7% in France to 73% in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="SamorinhaPereira2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samorinha|first1=C.|last2=Pereira|first2=M.|last3=Machado|first3=H.|last4=Figueiredo|first4=B.|last5=Silva|first5=S.|title=Factors associated with the donation and non-donation of embryos for research: a systematic review|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=5|year=2014|pages=641–655|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu026|pmid=24907125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in the United States revealed that 60% of American donors would donate the unused embryos to science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stemcellumbilicalcordblood.com/resources/60-of-donors-would-donate-unused-embryos-for-stem-cell-research/ 60% of Donors Would Donate Unused Embryos for Stem Cell Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

People who donate embryos for research often have been found in a review to report feelings of reciprocity towards science and medicine, positive views of research and high levels of trust in the medical system. They have described the decision to donate as better than the destruction of embryos, and as an opportunity to help others or to improve health and IVF technology. On the other hand, reported factors that make people refrain from embryo donation to research include a perception of risks, a lack of information concerning research projects and the medical system, as well as conceptualization of embryos in terms of [[personhood]]. The influence of sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive and gynecological history have mainly been found to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name="SamorinhaPereira2014"/&gt;

'''Frederick Matthias Alexander''' (20 January 1869 – 10 October 1955) was an Australian actor who developed the [[Alexander Technique]], an educational process said to recognize and overcome reactive, habitual limitations in movement and thinking.

==Early life==
Alexander was born on 20 January 1869, in Australia on the northern bank of the [[Inglis River]], near the present-day town of [[Wynyard, Tasmania]].  He was the eldest of ten children born to John Alexander, a blacksmith, and Betsy Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=10, 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were  the offspring of convicts transported to what was then called [[Van Diemen's Land]] for offences such as theft and destroying agricultural machinery as part of the 1830 [[Swing Riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his life Alexander was evasive about his ancestry, claiming Scottish descent  and upgrading the status of his forebears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=10, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander was born prematurely, and his survival was due to his mother's determination and care.  As a result, he was her favourite child, and they remained close throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with his religious, hard-working father was less strong, and Alexander, with other family members, later became estranged from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=18, 37, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later credited his father with teaching him to be alert and observant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved from Alexandria to Wynyard in 1870, and Alexander, though not strong physically, enjoyed rural activities such as fishing and shooting, and learned a love of horses, riding and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=15, 18–19, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelb"/&gt; He grew up in an evangelical Protestant household; the Sabbath was strictly observed, and his father, apparently a heavy drinker, seems to have taken a pledge of [[wikt:temperance|temperance]] in 1879. Alexander described himself as an agnostic, but was profoundly influenced by his Christian upbringing: his speech as an adult was peppered with biblical quotes, and he had been imbued a strong sense of right and wrong, self-discipline and personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education was not a priority for many local parents, but Betsy Alexander was determined that her children should be educated.  Alexander first attended a [[Sunday school]], and later the government school. Alexander was precocious, sensitive and attention-seeking, and as such made a difficult pupil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his teacher, a Scotsman named Robert Robertson, proved sympathetic, and acted as something of a father figure; he excused Alexander from daily school attendance and instead gave him lessons in the evening. As well as a basic education, Robertson gave Alexander a lifelong love of Shakespeare, theatre and poetry.&lt;ref name="Gelb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gelb | first = Michael J | authorlink = Michael J.

At age sixteen, he visited an aunt and uncle in [[Waratah, Tasmania|Waratah]], a town serving the tin-mine at [[Mount Bischoff]]. While there, he was offered a well-paying job by the mining company.  On the advice of his parents, he accepted the job, despite the disappointment it caused Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander's later account, his work at the mining company was appreciated by his employers; he took on additional jobs as a life insurance agent and a collector of rates, and was able to save ₤500, a considerable sum at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=25–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time, he pursued interests in horse racing and began learning the [[violin]].&lt;ref name="Gelb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in a local amateur dramatics society, playing several roles and meeting members of touring professional companies. These included the pianist with one company, Robert Young and his aspiring actress wife, Edith, who was later to marry Alexander himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melbourne 1889–1904==
In 1889, after three years in Waratah, Alexander decided to leave Tasmania to follow his aunt and uncle to [[Melbourne]] where they had moved the year before. He sought as he later put it "a wider scope of activity, not only in gaining a livelihood but in the fields of art and education in the fullest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his first three months in the city devoting himself to culture, and spending his savings on visiting theatres and art galleries and attending concerts.&lt;ref name="Gelb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own account, he determined to "train myself for a career as a reciter to take a position meanwhile in the office of some company."  He worked in a series of clerical jobs and took lessons from teachers such as an English actor James Cathcart, and an Australian elocutionist Fred Hill. He was inspired by the Melbourne theatrical performances of [[Sarah Bernhardt]], all of which he claimed to have attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander continued to suffer periods of ill-health, and was advised by his doctor to leave Melbourne for healthier climes.  Three months of seaside air of [[Geelong]] helped him recover his health, and he returned to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little information exists about much of Alexander's years in Melbourne,&lt;ref name="Bloch 2004 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from November 1891 onwards, newspapers began to report his participation in amateur dramatic recitals, and give them positive reviews.&lt;ref name="Bloch 2004 31"/&gt; However, Alexander began to suffer from hoarseness, and at times after performing could hardly speak. Friends also noted audible "gasping" during his recitations. As described forty years later in the first chapter of his book ''The Use of the Self'', advice from doctors and voice trainers did not have the necessary results, so he began a process of self-examination with mirrors into his speaking habits to see if he could determine the cause. With time, he found that by using "conscious control" of actions, by inhibiting wrong movements rather than trying to "do" correct ones, and by focussing on the "means whereby" rather than "the end to be gained", his vocal problems and longstanding respiratory problems disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence from other publications of Alexander's, however, suggests that these insights came to Alexander over a much longer period and in a less systematic fashion than he described in 1932, with some terms and procedures not appearing in his writings until as late as 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Australian Building.jpg|thumb|The Australian Building, Melbourne, to the left, where FM Alexander taught his technique.]]
Freed from his vocal problems, Alexander gave up his clerical jobs and embarked on a career as a professional reciter and voice teacher.  He commenced in early 1894 with a tour of his native Tasmania, which included an unhappy visit to his family. His parents' financial situation was precarious, and they had been deeply affected by the death of an infant son in 1893; his father turned to alcohol as a result.  According to Alexander, father and son quarrelled, with John Alexander expressing disapproval of his son as a "vagabond and strolling player", and  there is no record of them ever meeting again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the tour was a success, with excellent press reviews and a performance before the [[Governor of Tasmania]] in [[Hobart]], a concert in which Robert and Edith Young, whom he had met years earlier at Watarah, also appeared.  The trio developed a close friendship. Besides giving recitals, he also gave "elocution lessons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1895, he set out for New Zealand where he visited various cities, giving recitals to excellent reviews and voice lessons to several prominent individuals, including [[Frederic Villiers]] and the Mayor of [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being advised to go to America to seek his fortune, he returned to Melbourne, with the intention of teaching his new method there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Alexander rented teaching rooms in a landmark building on Elizabeth St, known as the Australian Building. He advertised his voice lessons in the press and with pamphlets, claiming both to develop the voice and to "cure" [[stuttering]] and throat ailments. In his pamphlets his pupils, in the early days mainly clergymen, enthusiastically testified to improvements in their voice and general health, and doctors reported that patients sent to him had improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the year, Alexander invited a younger brother Albert Redden Alexander (known as A.R.) to join him as his assistant; he was followed by a sister, Amy, who came initially to receive help for medical problems, but was then also trained in the work. Back in Tasmania, Alexander's father was drinking heavily, and the family's economic situation was bleak; towards the end of the year, Alexander's mother and three of his siblings arrived in Melbourne, never to return. Alexander devoted himself mainly to his teaching and practice, with an occasional recital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=44–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, Alexander moved in with his old friends Robert and Edith Young and formed something of a [[menage à trois]], with Edith and Alexander's affair accepted by Robert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=46, 55, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trio organized theatrical entertainments in Melbourne and then in [[Sydney]] where Alexander, and later the Youngs, moved in 1900. Due in part to Edith Young's ambitions as a professional actor, from 1901 to 1903 Alexander and the Youngs produced a series of Shakespearean plays, starring Alexander and Edith, and with Alexander's students in the lesser roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=46–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander spent most of his time on the money-losing plays and Shakespeare classes and little time teaching his method.  However, in 1902, his approach impressed a leading Sydney surgeon, W. J. Stewart McKay, who helped him with referrals and became a close friend. Perhaps as a result, Alexander's method (and advertising) focussed more on medical issues, including tuberculosis. McKay also encouraged Alexander to develop his medical knowledge by attending classes at the medical school, but he proved a poor student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=49–52, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKay recommended Alexander go to London, and offered to give him introductions to leading doctors there. Alexander was in debt, but his financial problems were alleviated when he won a ₤750 horse racing bet. This allowed him to pay off some of his creditors, provide some support for his female relatives and buy a passage to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed from Melbourne in April 1904, and was not to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London 1904–1914==
[[File:Poster made to advertise services of F M Alexander.gif|thumb|left|Early advertising material for Alexander's services in London]]Alexander arrived London in June 1904, and quickly acquired a fine wardrobe, a manservant, and a smart address at the Army &amp; Navy Mansions in Victoria Street. As he later said "In those days, you just couldn't get on here [London] unless you appeared to be the right sort."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp= 55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed with letters of recommendation from Dr. McKay and others Australian doctors, he quickly gained important supporters in the London medical community. A key contact and mentor was the [[Otolaryngology|ENT]] surgeon R.H. Scanes Spicer, who took lessons and promoted Alexander's method and referred him pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp= 61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given Alexander's love of the theatre, he was particularly delighted when Spicer asked him to see the actress [[Lily Brayton]], who had lost her voice. Alexander's successful treatment led to introductions to other theatrical luminaries including Brayton's husband [[Oscar Asche]], [[Henry Irving]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]].  The first three were supportive, but having taken a lesson George Alexander accused his teacher of "practising extortion" when given the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp= 66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, after two years, Alexander's practice was booming,  and with a rate of 4 guineas an hour, Alexander was doing well financially. He likely remitted some of his earnings to Australia to help support his mothers and sisters, and to repay his debts, but he was also able to live well. He developed a taste for the finer things in life, including food, wine and cigars, and was a regular patron of London's best restaurants. He rode his horse daily, fox-hunted periodically, and pursued his lifelong interest in horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp= 73, 79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander produced a series of pamphlets in order to explain his discoveries about respiration and the voice and describe his successful cases.  Alexander was not a good or clear writer, but these works show the development of  Alexander's theories and the first mentions in print of such important concepts in the Alexander Technique as "conscious control", "antagonistic action", the whispered "ah", the unreliability of self-perceptions and sensations,  "inhibition" and the "means whereby".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Edith Young travelled to England soon after, arriving in September 1904.  Letters from her ailing husband Robert suggest that he encouraged her to follow Alexander, and urged Alexander to take care of and be faithful to her.  Alexander had hoped that Edith would help him with his teaching, but she was interested in a stage career, and was scornful of his work. Motivated by concerns about respectability and perhaps about what she might reveal about his past, Alexander installed her at a distance in the suburb of [[Streatham]]. Michael Bloch, Alexander's biographer, speculates that "for some years she may have been the one person before whom he never had to pretend, with whom he was able to reminisce about his old life and friends in Australia, and who offered him intimate comforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=55, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Alexander was a private man who enjoyed social company, but he was not a party-goer and did not join clubs or societies. Instead of close friendships, he tended to have disciples and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, as also happened frequently throughout his life, Alexander fell out with a friend and supporter, in this case Dr. Spicer. In a series of papers, Spicer, who clearly believed that Alexander lacked medical knowledge, claimed corrections of posture and respiration for the medical profession rather "untrained amateurs and ignorant quacks".  Alexander responded with pamphlets accusing Spicer of plagiarism and distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this dispute, Alexander finally produced a long-contemplated book, which appeared in three parts: ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'' (October 1910), an ''Addenda'' (March 1911), and ''Conscious Control'' (October 1912).  These were combined into one volume in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 Alexander's mother and his sister Amy arrived for a visit and moved into his rooms at  Army &amp; Navy Mansions in Westminster, while Alexander lived and practiced at the nearby 16 Ashley Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amy began to teach some of Alexander's female pupils, and before the end of 1911 it appears to have been decided that the visitors would remain permanently, and that other members of the Alexander family would come to join them. Over the next few years, four of Alexander's siblings moved to London.  His father and other brothers did not make the move. Estranged from her husband, Betsy Alexander claimed to be a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's brother A.R. joined the growing practice, which included pupils such as the politician [[Reginald McKenna]], the businessman [[Waldorf Astor]], and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Edith, Viscountess Castlereagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander also engaged Ethel Webb, a former pupil, as a teacher, the first from outside his family. She connected Alexander to two other women who would be important to his work, Irene Tasker and [[Margaret Naumburg]]. The latter, an American, offered to help him fulfill a long held desire: to introduce the approach in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 August 1914, before a month his departure, he married Edith Young at a registry office wedding. Her husband, Robert had died in September 1910, and Alexander had supported her since that time. The couple were, however, to spend much of the years that followed apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American years 1914–1924==
Alexander sailed for New York in September 1914, where he joined Margaret Naumberg.  Influenced by [[Montessori education]], psychoanalysis and Alexander's work, she had just founded the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]], and assisted Alexander in setting up a practice, including recruiting influential pupils such as [[Arthur M. Reis]] and [[Waldo Frank]].  The business was soon booming, and by the end of 1914, Ethel Webb came from the United Kingdom to assist in the teaching. With the exception of the winter of 1921–2, for the next ten years, Alexander spent the autumn and winter of the year in the United States, and returned to the United Kingdom for the late spring and summer to see family members and rest. For the first few years, Webb remained in the US to keep the practice open over the summer months. In 1916 Irene Tasker, joined the New York practice as an apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=98, 100–04, 111, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was proudly British; he never really felt at home in the United States, and was critical of American society, including their lack of involvement, until 1917, in the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=103–04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1916, the American philosopher and educational pioneer [[John Dewey]] became a pupil.  Dewey had long suffered from stress-related health issues, and these had become acute in the wake of a series of personal and professional difficulties.  His series of lessons resulted in long-lasting physical and intellectual improvements; more than 25 years later, in his eighties, Dewey attributed 90% of his good health to Alexander's techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=106–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and Alexander met frequently in the years that followed, and the writings of both show the influence of the interactions. In addition, Dewey's promotion of the technique led to other prominent academics to enroll themselves and their families. Dewey also encouraged Alexander to bring out an American edition of ''Man's Supreme Inheritance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=108–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Irene Tasker, he extensively revised the text and included new chapters on addictions, obsessive behaviours, and on the causes of the First World War, which he laid firmly at the door of Germany as a country of that has "progressed but little on the upward evolutionary stage from the state occupied by the brute beast and the savage."  The book, with an introduction by Dewey, appeared in January 1918, and received enthusiastic reviews, many written by Alexander's distinguished pupils.  However,  former pupil [[Randolph Bourne]], writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', while recognising the practical benefit of the technique, criticised Alexander's belief in the evolution of human society towards conscious control, a complaint echoed by the historian [[James Harvey Robinson]] in an [[Atlantic Monthly]] review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey was so incensed by Bourne's review that he threatened never to contribute to the New Republic again if they published any further articles by Bourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of book led to an influx of new pupils to the practice.  The demand meant that A.R. was needed in the United States for the winters of 1918–9 and 1919–20; that he was able to do so was a testimony to "the work", as A.R. had received serious injuries in a fall from a horse in 1918, and had been told by doctors that he would never walk again.  For the rest of his life, however, A.R. used a cane and taught sitting down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 the brothers began periodic teaching in Boston, and started providing a continuous presence in America and London: each summer for the next four years A.R. continued teaching in the US, only going back to the United Kingdom when Alexander returned to America in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post war, the London practice at No. 16 Ashley Place (near Victoria Station) was also doing well, and both Ethel Webb and Irene Tasker returned to work there. Prominent pupils during this period included a future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]] and the chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=119–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed good relations with several doctor pupils, who helped him and, in the case of two of them, [[Andrew Rugg-Gunn]], [[J. E. R. McDonagh]], became lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's charismatic personality often led to romantic feelings in women; among those smitten was Ethel Webb, who had spent more time with Alexander than his wife.  The two women hated each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=95, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander and Edith's marriage was in difficulties: but the pair agreed to adopt Peggy Piddock, born in 1918, the daughter of Edith's younger sister May, and they were both devoted to their daughter, which likely kept the couple together.&lt;ref name=b120&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her nephew 27-year-old ex-army officer Owen Vicary moved into the basement flat at Ashley Place with his wife Gladys (known as Jack) and their two children, and Edith appears to have developed romantic feelings for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=105, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander was considering writing another book, and was spurred into action by the 1922 publication of a book by [[Gerald Stanley Lee]] which clearly described Alexander's techniques without acknowledging their originator. He considered [[patent]]ing the method, but was told this would be impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=120, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''"Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual"'', which Alexander was later to describe has his most important book, was published in May 1923 in United States with an introduction written by Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander missed the launch as he had to return to the UK due to family difficulties following his mother's death in February 1923 while Alexander was in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being clearer, more coherent and better written, it received less notice than its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=123–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following a lawsuit in 1923 resulting from an attempted return of a new car after a few weeks, Alexander transferred all his considerable assets to friends and arranged to be declared bankrupt rather than pay the debt he owed. The debt was later bought and cancelled by friends, but Alexander never applied for discharge from bankruptcy and thus remained technically bankrupt until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's regular visits to America ended in the spring of 1924, and from then on both he and A.R. were based in London. His bankruptcy notwithstanding, he was financially successful and had a flourishing practice in London and could afford to live where he felt happiest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason was to distance himself from Dewey, who was proposing a scientific trial of the technique; the prospect alarmed Alexander as he had no confidence in the investigation and in addition feared a loss of control over the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England 1925–1940, 1943–1956==
In March 1925, Alexander bought an 18th-century farmhouse ''Penhill'' with {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of grounds, in [[Sidcup]], Kent. The property included a lodge, occupied by a family of 5, all of whom worked in house or grounds. Edith and their daughter Peggy took up residence, with Alexander joining them at the weekends to ride his horse and tend his garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=130–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were soon joined by Jack Vicary, who having left her husband, moved to a cottage near Penhill in which she ran a shop. Initially, there was a good relationship between the two households, and the Alexanders' relationship went through a happier period.  However, in 1929, the two separated; Edith had become jealous of Alexander's work and relationships, especially those with women, and bitter about her own aging and lack of success. Edith  moved back to [[Maida Vale|Little Venice]] in London, and Peggy spent the weekdays with her, and weekends at Penhill with her father.  Edith became an alcoholic, and  died in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=140–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander had become increasingly attracted to Jack, and the two began an affair, which resulted in the birth of a son, John Vicary, born in the US in June 1931. Jack had travelled there for the sake of respectability, and claimed to have adopted John there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At Ashley Place, the "little school" was founded with Irene Tasker as teacher, not only of the Alexander Technique, but also of academics. About six to eight students, most of whom had disabilities of some sort, attended at first, but the numbers grew to a dozen by 1933, requiring a move to a larger space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=131–32, 154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a false start involving [[Esther Lawrence]], a wealthy former principal of the [[Froebel Institute]], who had offered Alexander a large, furnished house, the school moved to Penhill in 1934 and became a [[boarding school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=154–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Alexander's approach received a boost from a theoretical perspective when the German professor [[Rudolf Magnus]] published his book about the physiology of posture.  As his supporters were quick to note, Magnus' scientific conclusions in many ways mirrored many of Alexander's longstanding principles, including that correct functioning is dependent on the alignment of the head, neck and back, and on correct sensory perception. Critics pointed out differences between the two theories, however, and the current view is that the two theories are related but describe different concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander also attracted several important new pupils, including the statesman [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton]] who drew public attention to the technique in the [[Times Educational Supplement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=133–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initially skeptical writer [[Anthony Ludovici]] who went on to praise Alexander's approach in a book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=136–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the industrialist [[Robert Dudley Best]] who supported the Alexander Technique, including the expansion of teaching to [[Birmingham]], but also challenged Alexander, including writing a 1941 essay of constructive criticism. In particular, Best complained about Alexander's explanations and dismissive responses to pupils, and his expectation of unquestioning acceptance of his work. He viewed Alexander as limited in his perspective, with little awareness of the artistic and spiritual, and constrained by the view that he had the solution to all problems in life that his approach answered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=138–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first training course was started in September 1930, at Ashley Place, and continued alongside his own practice until 1940.  When the war came he lived and worked in the United States from 1940 until 1943, which was a difficult time as his teachers were disappearing into the services. Fearing that the technique would be lost, he returned to London in 1943 and successfully restarted the training course.

At the end of the war, in 1944, Dr. Dorothy Morrison (''née'' Drew), hoping for improvement to her own 'use' (following injury in a car crash) and to the health of her disabled mother, joined the small group of Alexander's pupils at Ashley Place. Dorothy became a close friend of Alexander's at that time, gave medical evidence at the Libel case in South Africa and soon after lived there in Johannesburg with her family.

A portrait in [[oil painting|oil]] of Alexander, painted to commemorate his 80th birthday by the Australian artist [[Colin Colahan]], was shown on the BBC's ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' programme in May 2013, when it was still in the possession of the son of the wife of his nephew.&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Stowe House 2 | series = Antiques Roadshow | serieslink = Antiques Roadshow | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00zjms49 | accessdate = 2013-05-19 | network = [[BBC Television]] | date = 2013-05-19 | seriesno = 35 | number = 23 | transcript =  | transcripturl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Irene Tasker, one of Alexander's first students, arrived in [[Johannesburg]], deciding to teach the Alexander Technique in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her address to the annual conference of the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] Teachers Association on the subject initially attracted much interest from teachers, soon spreading to others. In 1939 Tasker started a school, in Sherwood Road, [[Forest Town, Gauteng|Forest Town]], to teach the [[Alexander Technique]] to children, where the children could be educated along the lines set out by [[Maria Montessori]] at the same time as attention was paid to the way in which they used themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Alexander Principle in Education'', an address given for the Montessori Society at the College of Education, Johannesburg, July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 Tasker's work attracted the attention of Dr Ernst Jokl, Director of [[Physical Education]] to the South African Government, and a writer on the physiology of exercise.  Jokl asked Tasker to demonstrate the Technique to him, which she did in the presence of two legal witnesses,  Norman Coaker [[King's Counsel|KC]] and [[Advocate|Adv.]] [[Vernon Berrangé]], but declined to give him a course of lessons, instead suggesting that Jokl go to see Alexander himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jokl, not being able to go to London, read Alexander's books.  In April the next year, in an address to the annual conference of  the Transvaal Teachers Association, its President, Mr. I. G. Griffiths, praised the Alexander Technique and criticized the established regime of physical education then given to children.  His address was published in''Transvaaal Educational News'', and Jokl, seeing this address as an attack on his profession, responded in a paper called 'The Relationship between Health and Efficiency' which he read to the South African Association for the Advancement of Science.  Jokl then had his paper published in ''Transvaal Educational News'', with a reply defending Alexander's work.  In March 1944 Jokl wrote an article in the South African government journal ''Manpower'' (Afrikaans ''Volkskragte'') entitled 'Quackery versus Physical Education' which described the Technique as, among other things, 'a dangerous and irresponsible form of quackery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August of that year Alexander was shown the article by Tasker, and responded with  a letter to the South African [[High Commissioner]] in London asking for a public withdrawal of the remarks and an apology.  Having had no reply a year later, Alexander sued: he issued a writ for libel against Jokl, Eustace H. Cluver and Bernard Maule Clarke (the co-editors of ''Manpower'') suing for £5000 damages for alleged [[defamation]].  Alexander was dismayed that the South African authorities announced the case would be defended, but however he expected a case to be won quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination in London ===
As witnesses on both sides were British, it was easier for evidence on both sides to be presented before a Commission in [[South Africa House]] in London, but due to delays this did not happen until July 1947.  Alexander and Jokl attended all the hearings.  Alexander's witnesses included Duncan Whittaker, Dr Peter Macdonald, [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], [[Sir Stafford Cripps]], Dr Dorothy Drew, his personal physician J. E. R. McDonagh, and his friend Andrew Rugg-Gunn FRCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jokl's witnesses were Nobel Prizewinners [[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Edgar Adrian]] and [[Henry Hallett Dale|Sir Henry Dale]], Brigadier Wand-Tetley, heart specialist Dr Paul Wood, bacteriologist Dr Freddie Himmelweit, Sir Alfred Webb-Johnson, Samson Wright, Lieut-Col S. J. Parker and Robert Clark-Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial was scheduled to be in South Africa in the autumn of 1947, but there was delay due to the defence counsel [[Oswald Pirow]] having another matter to deal with, and the case was rescheduled to the following March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alexander's stroke ===
Alexander wanted to go, and booked a stateroom in a [[Union Castle Line|Union Castle liner]] for himself.  But that was not to happen.  He was worried about the case, distraught over the death of his friend Lord Lytton in October 1947, and that autumn he had a fall which may have contributed to his having a stroke in December.  A week later he had another stroke, was left with the paralysis of his left hand, leg and face, and doctors had little hope for him.  He had to cancel his trip to South Africa.  However, he made a remarkable recovery within a month, it was said by applying his own technique to himself.  He wrote to Irene Tasker in South Africa, in a clear hand, telling her how much better he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Court in Johannesburg ===
In February 1948 three of his medically qualified students, Dr Wilfred Barlow, F.R.S., Dr Dorothy Drew M.R.C.S (Eng), L.R.C.P (Lon) and Dr Mungo Douglas flew to Johannesburg to give evidence to the Court. Douglas did not give evidence: his place was taken by Norman Coaker, K.C. who lived in South Africa and, like Jokl, had seen Irene Tasker.  There was great interest in the case.  The papers reported all the proceedings, and every day the court was crowded.

On 14 February the case ''Alexander v. Jokl and others'',&lt;ref&gt;Johannesburg newspapers ''The Star'' and ''Rand Daily Mail'' 16 February 1948 – 4 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt; an action for £5,000 damages for alleged defamation opened before Mr Justice Clayden in the [[Witwatersrand Local Division]] of the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harold Hanson|Mr H. J. Hanson, K.C]] and Mr [[Abram Fischer]] (instructed by Messrs [[Vernon Berrangé|Berrangé]] and Wasserzug) appeared for the plaintiff, and [[Oswald Pirow|Mr O. Pirow, K.C.]] and Mr M. van Hulsteyn (instructed by the Government Attorney) appeared for the defendants.  In an introductory address Mr Hanson said that Alexander's technique and ideas had received favourable comment from such eminent people as Sir [[Charles Sherrington]], [[John Dewey]], [[Aldous Huxley]], Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] and others. In his books Alexander taught what he had observed in his investigation into the use and mis-use of the body.  He taught people to understand their own use, to unlearn the wrong way, as in the example of a person sitting at a desk having a tendency to hunch the shoulders by tensing muscles unnecessarily.  Mr Hanson told the court that Alexander had recently had a stroke and would therefore not be able to give evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Barlow was Alexander's first witness.&lt;ref name="Bloch 2004 221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He described how he had hurt his shoulder in sport at Oxford, had tried various ways of remedying it, had read Alexander's books and realised that a problem was that people who used their muscles in the wrong way could come to regard that use as the right way.  He went to London, saw Alexander, became of student and later a qualified teacher of the method.  He had seen for himself in [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London how the technique could help in the treatment of bad muscular co-ordination or misuse, and quoted supporting text from recognised publications such as [[The Lancet]], the [[British Medical Journal]] and the [[American Medical Association]]'s Journal.

Mr Pirow, for the defence, proposed that his case was that the article (by Jokl and others) represented an evaluation of Alexander's four books, which claimed to set out the technique and its philosophy, and contained not only mainly testimonials and sales talk advertising the technique, but in regard to his alleged discoveries of conscious and/or primary control, claims and statements representing dangerous quackery.

Pirow was expert at persistent cross-questioning, throwing [[leading question]]s at all Alexander's witnesses. Pirow asked Dr. Barlow: "Do you seriously contend, in the matter of conscious control, that anyone following fully its principles would become entirely disease free?"  Barlow: "No-one suggests that man will become immortal."  "Let us leave immortality out of it, and get down to fundamentals. Are you, as a trained medical man, prepared to accept as a reasonable possibility the suggestion that by the carrying out of the exercises of psycho-physical guidance by way of conscious control, one can get complete immunity against disease?"  – "It might be possible...animals living in a wild state when they come to the end of their days do not suffer from many of the prevalent diseases."  "So that by following the technique man would become like an animal or buffalo?" – "I am merely giving you my impression about the diseases which affect animals."  "Do you seriously suggest that, as a result of psycho-physical guidance under conscious control, resistance to infectious disease might be better?" – "Well, yes."  And Barlow said it was from his own medical experience.  Pirow asked what conscious control was, about inhibition and their effects, to which Barlow was able to give confident answers.

Witness Dr Dorothy Drew, a London doctor, had become a convert to the Alexander Technique because of the benefit she had found to herself after undergoing a course.&lt;ref name="Bloch 2004 221"/&gt; She had been injured in a car accident when she was a medical student, and during the war her health deteriorated.  She had read Alexander's books in the war and became a pupil of Alexander's. At first she felt pain, but began to feel increasing benefit. Alexander's sole interest was in repairing her body mechanics, and her health had improved. She had sent about 200 patients to Alexander, supplementary to medical treatment: she always showed them his books and let them decide for themselves whether to see Alexander.

Norman Coaker, who had been present at Jokl's demonstration lesson with Irene Tasker, was the next witness for Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He described how his two sons had been helped by Alexander lessons: his second son with an injury from a fall onto stone, and his elder son with chronic [[bronchitis]].

Irene Tasker was Alexander's last witness, and at one point she found it difficult to give evidence and face Pirow's cross-questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Jokl himself was the last witness for the defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial finished in March, and Mr Justice Clayden delivered his judgement over a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was awarded £1000 damages plus costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloch|2004|pp=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later the defendants appealed against the verdict and the damages. The appeal was dismissed with costs, and the tone of the judgment was worded more in approval of Alexander than it had been originally.

== Final years ==
Alexander continued to work until his sudden death in 1955.  His funeral was at South London Crematorium, Streatham Vale.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 12 October 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice at 16 Ashley Place was taken over by one of his assistants, Patrick Macdonald.

The '''Family Violence Prevention and Services Act''' (FVPSA) is a [[United States]] law, first authorized as part of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (PL 98–457), that provides federal funding to help victims of [[domestic violence]] and their dependent children by providing shelter and related help, offering violence prevention programs, and improving how service agencies work together in communities. 
* The 24-hour, confidential, toll-free [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] provides support, information, referrals, safety planning, and [[crisis intervention]] in more than 170 languages to hundreds of thousands of domestic violence victims each year.
* The Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA) Program teaches people ways to prevent violence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Feighner Criteria''' is the informal name given to influential [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria developed at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.

The criteria are named after a psychiatric paper published in 1972 of which John Feighner was the first listed author.&lt;ref&gt;Feighner JP, Robins E, Guze SB, Woodruff RA, Winokur G, Munoz R (1972) Diagnostic criteria for use in psychiatric research. ''Archives of General Psychiatry.'' '''26''': 57-63  {{PMID|5009428}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the most cited article in psychiatry for some time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v12p321y1989.pdf  A Tribute to Eli &amp; Lee Robbins - Citation Superstars. A Citationist Perspective on Biological Psychiatry - v12p321y1989.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of the criteria had been led by a trio of psychiatrists working together on the project for a [[medical model]] of psychiatric diagnosis since the late 1950s: [[Eli Robins]], [[Samuel Guze]] and [[George Winokur]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16527361 Training at Washington University School of Medicine in Psychiatry in the late 1950s, from the perspective of an affective disorder researcher.] Clayton PJ., J Affect Disord. 2006 May;92(1):13-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4AuzzBIKvlIC The Making of DSM-III: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry] Hannah Decker, Oxford University Press, 29 Mar 2013. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen conditions were defined, including primary affective disorders (such as depression), [[schizophrenia]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety neurosis]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]]. In the early 1970s [[homosexuality]] was considered a psychiatric illness by the medical community, and was also included as one of the fourteen conditions. 

The criteria were expanded in the publication of the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] on which many of the criteria of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM_III#DSM-III_.281980.29|DSM III]] (1980) were based, which in turn shaped the [[World Health Organization]]'s ICD manual. "The historical record shows that the small group of individuals who created the Feighner criteria instigated a paradigm shift that has had profound effects on the course of American and, ultimately, world psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=102104 The Development of the Feighner Criteria: A Historical Perspective]  Kenneth S.

'''Food or drink competitions''' reward products primarily for their "gustative worth" in the form of an award or a medal. These competitions can be classified into different categories, and most awards are product-specific, such as for wines, beers, and cheeses. Others focus on local, regional and/or national products. Finally, the international competitions test all kinds of foods and drinks available to consumers on a retail basis. Wine is probably the most tested drink, followed by beer and spirits.

There is a variety of such food and drink competitions worldwide, where the taste and quality of products are assessed. Most evaluations are carried out blind, sometimes complemented by laboratory analysis. The jury usually consists of a panel of different types of "experts" in tastings such as chefs or [[sommelier]]s. 

The history of degustation tests is unclear; however, one of the earliest taste awards recorded for drinks is the [[Brewing Industry International Awards]], dating back to 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewingawards.org/articles_30_competition-history_2_awards.html Brewing Awards - Welcome to the International Brewing Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For food, [[Monde Selection]] is the oldest award recorded, first run in 1961. Since then, as the variety of food products on the market has grown, so has the number of competitions and evaluations.

Monde Selection states that "This bronze, silver, gold or grand gold quality label can be compared to the quality stars of a hotel or those of the [[Michelin Guide]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.1_Our_Mission/1.1_Our_Mission.asp |title=Monde Selection : Our Mission |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst both processes are anonymous, Michelin chooses the hotels and restaurants it reviews and pays for everything. Only products who pay the Euro 1,100 entry fee are reviewed by Monde Selection. Unlike [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals]], where only one of each is awarded per event, there are no limits to how many can be awarded in each category. Other competitions use a similar business model.

Most awarding organizations charge an entry fee. Alternatively, for some awards, producers or retailers pay a fee only if their products are awarded and/or they decide to communicate about the award (payment for the right to show the award on packaging).&lt;ref&gt;http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf2 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819190203/http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In both cases, one might think that these recognitions can be bought. However, tastings are carried out independently and are blind-tested, where judges focus exclusively on sensory ([[organoleptic]]) features, such as taste, olfaction, vision, aspect, mouth-feel, after-taste, without being influenced by packaging, branding or marketing. Of course, only producers who pay the entry fee can make use of any award made.

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''''Forum non conveniens''''' ([[Latin]] for "forum not agreeing") ('''FNC''') is a (mostly) [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] whereby courts may refuse to take jurisdiction over matters where there is a more appropriate forum available to the parties. As a doctrine of the [[conflict of laws]], ''forum non conveniens'' applies between courts in different countries and between courts in different [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s in the same country. ''Forum non conveniens'' is not applicable between counties or federal districts within a state.

A concern often raised in applications of the doctrine is [[forum shopping]], or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where there may be more than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or [[comity]], also apply in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems in the form of the legal doctrine of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]''.

''Forum non conveniens'' is not exclusive to common law nations: the maritime courts of the [[Republic of Panama]], although not a common law jurisdiction, also have such power under more restrained conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ARRUE MONTENEGRO, Carlos Alberto. ''Le forum non conveniens à l'assaut des compétences exorbitantes : l'expérience panaméenne'', [[Panthéon-Assas University]],  2006, p. 85. (http://catalogue.ppl.nl/DB=1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
A [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]] enacts laws which are interpreted and applied through a system of courts. The laws applied by a particular system of courts or legal system are termed the ''[[lex fori]]'', or law of the forum. As a matter of [[civil procedure]], courts must decide whether and in what circumstances they will accept [[jurisdiction]] over [[party (law)|parties]] and subject matter when a [[lawsuit]] begins. This decision will be routine, or not raised at all, if the relevant elements of the case are within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. If one or more of the parties resides outside the territorial [[jurisdiction]] or there are other factors which might make another forum more appropriate, the question of jurisdiction must be settled.

===Historical origin===
Scholars and jurists seem to find a Scottish origin prior to the first American use of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/decisions/Publishedopinions/96-01284.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicium.it/news/pistis01.html#_edn1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://works.bepress.com/context/graydon_staring/article/1008/type/native/viewcontent/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/us/454/235/case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers see the doctrine of FNC as having developed from an earlier doctrine of ''forum non competens'' ("non-competent forum"). Many early cases in the U.S. and Scotland involving FNC were cases under [[admiralty law]]. FNC thus may ultimately have a [[civilian law|civil law]] origin, as has been asserted by several writers, since admiralty law is based in civil law concepts.

The doctrine of FNC originated in the [[United States]] in ''Willendson v. Forsoket'' [29 Fed Cas 1283 (DC Pa 1801)] (No 17,682) where a federal district court in [[Pennsylvania]] declined to exercise jurisdiction over a [[Denmark|Danish]] sea captain who was being sued for back wages by a Danish seaman, stating that "[i]f any differences should hereafter arise, it must be settled by a Danish tribunal." In [[Scotland]], the concept is first recorded in ''MacMaster v. MacMaster'' (Judgment of 7 June 1833, Sess, Scot 11 Sess Cas, First Series 685.)

===United Kingdom===
The doctrine has limited application in most civil law jurisdictions which prefer ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'', although the principle behind FNC is acknowledged. As a member of the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] signed the [[Brussels Convention]]. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1982) as amended by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1991) states:
{{quote|Nothing in this Act shall prevent any court in the UK from staying, sisting [staying or stopping a process, or summoning a party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209114651/http://scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;], striking out or dismissing any proceedings before it on the ground of ''forum non conveniens'' or otherwise, where to do so is not inconsistent with the 1968 [Brussels] Convention or, as the case may be, the Lugano Convention.}}

The case of ''Owusu v Jackson and Others''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C28102.html&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[European Court of Justice]], was concerned with the relationship between Article 2 of the Brussels Convention and the scope of FNC within the [[European Community]]. In ''Owusu'', the English [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] asked the ECJ whether it could stay a matter brought to it under Article 2 Brussels Convention pursuant to the English FNC rules. The Court held that the Brussels Convention was a mandatory set of rules designed to harmonise and so produce a predictable system throughout the EU. If states were able to derogate from the Convention using their domestic rules of civil procedure, this would deny a uniform result to proceedings based on forum selection. Hence, at 46. the ECJ held:
{{quote|the Brussels Convention precludes a court of a Contracting State from declining the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 2 of that convention on the ground that a court of a non-Contracting State would be a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action even if the jurisdiction of no other Contracting State is in issue or the proceedings have no connecting factors to any other Contracting State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waltonsandmorse.com/Decisions2.jsp?decisionsID=9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, some UK commentators argue that the FNC rules may still apply to cases where the other proceedings are not in a Member state but this remains uncertain. What is certain is that a Scottish Court may sist its proceedings in favour of the Courts of England or Northern Ireland on the ground of FNC, since this is settling intra-UK jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming v Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd, The Times June 8, 1995; Collins: 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In the jurisdictions where the FNC rule survives, a court will usually dismiss a case when the judge determines that the dispute would be better adjudicated in a different forum. Courts have been split in their applications of the rule. In ''Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co v Fay'' (1988) 165 CLR 197 and ''Voth v Manildra Flour Mills'' (1990) 171 CLR 538 the [[High Court of Australia]] refused to adopt the "most suitable forum" approach and instead devised its own "clearly inappropriate forum" test. Nevertheless, the Australian courts balanced the foreign and local factors, and a dismissal would only be granted if the defendant could show that he was "oppressed" or "harassed" by the plaintiff's choice of Australia for legal action. This retained the rationale of the traditional doctrine, making it impossible for Australian defendants to obtain a dismissal from their own courts on FNC grounds. In ''Regie National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang'' (2002) 210 CLR 491, the High Court affirmed the "clearly inappropriate forum" test as Australian law, while stating that even where the law of a foreign country had to be applied to decide a case, Australia would not be a "clearly inappropriate" forum for hearing the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lindell: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
However, with the advent of the Civil Procedure Act (2005), this common law position in Australia has changed.

===Canada===
The doctrine of FNC in Canada was considered in ''Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia Worker's Compensation Board'', [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897. The Court held that the test for striking out a claim for FNC is where "there is another forum that is clearly more appropriate than the domestic forum." If the forums are both found to be equally convenient, the domestic forum will always win out.

Convenience is weighed, using a multi-factored test that includes elements such as: the connection between the plaintiff's claim and the forum, the connection between the defendant and the forum, unfairness to the defendant by choosing the forum, unfairness to the plaintiff in not choosing the forum, involvement of other parties to the suit (i.e. location of witnesses), and issues of [[comity]] such as reciprocity and standard of adjudication.

The Supreme Court has underlined that FNC inquiries are similar to but distinct from the [[Real and substantial connection|Real and Substantial connection"]] test used in challenges to jurisdiction. The most important difference is that applying FNC is a discretionary choice between two forums, each of which could legally hear the issue.

The law of the province of Quebec, Canada is slightly different. The Quebec Civil Code 1994, at art. 3135 c.c.q., provides:
{{quote|Even though a Quebec authority has jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may exceptionally and on an application by a party, decline jurisdiction if it considers that the authorities of another country are in a better position to decide.}}

The practical effects are identical to any other jurisdiction but the wording used by the code is different. For decisions applying art. 3135 c.c.q., see ''H.L. Boulton &amp; Co. S.C.C.A. v. Banque Royale du Canada'' (1995) R.J.Q. 213 (Quebec. Supr. Ct.); ''Lamborghini (Canada) Inc. v. Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A.'' (1997) R.J.Q. 58 (Quebec. C.A.); ''Spar Aerospace v. American Mobile Satellite'' (2002) 4 S.C.R. 205, and ''Grecon Dimter Inc. v. J.R. Normand Inc.'' (2004) R.J.Q. 88 (Quebec. C.A.)

===United States===
The defendant may move to dismiss an action on the ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine usually means that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff’s choice of forum. In other words, if the plaintiff’s choice of forum was reasonable, the defendant must show a compelling reason to change jurisdiction. If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.

Generally, a corporation sued in the jurisdiction of its headquarters is not entitled to seek an FNC dismissal. Thus if an [[United States|American]] corporation is sued in an area where it only transacts business but not where it has its headquarters, and the court dismisses based upon FNC, the plaintiff may refile the action in the jurisdiction of the corporation’s headquarters.

In deciding whether to grant the motion, the court considers:
* The location of potential [[witnesses]]. The defendant must make a full and candid showing, naming the potential witnesses for the defense, specifying their location, specifying what their testimony may be and how crucial it is for the defense, and setting forth how exactly they may be inconvenienced by having to testify in the court chosen by plaintiff.
* The location of [[relevance (law)|relevant]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and records. The defendant must identify the records; explain who is in charge of the records; address necessity, language, and translation problems; address the volume of such records; address the law governing these records; and rule out the existence of duplicate records in the jurisdiction chosen by the plaintiff. The mere fact that records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.
* Possible [[undue hardship]] for the [[defendant]]. The defendant must explain what the hardship is and how material the costs are. If there are costs involved, they need to be spelled out. If there is a difficulty in getting witnesses out of a foreign court and into the original court, this needs to be revealed to the court. The defendant must explain why the use of [[letters rogatory]] or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.
* Availability of adequate alternative forums for the plaintiff. Merely pointing out that the plaintiff could have sued somewhere else is not sufficient to succeed on an FNC motion.
* The expeditious use of [[judicial]] resources. In practice, this is just boilerplate language that comes along with the application. However, sometimes the court chosen by the plaintiff may be logistically or administratively unfit or ill‐equipped for the case; for example, a case may involve a large number of torts.
* The [[choice of law]] applicable to the dispute. If all other factors weigh in favor of keeping the case in the jurisdiction where it was filed, then the court may choose between application of local law (''lex fori'') or relevant foreign law. Thus, the mere fact that foreign law may apply to the event, circumstances, accident, or occurrence is not a strong reason to dismiss the case on FNC grounds.
* Questions of [[public policy (law)|public policy]]. In analyzing the factors, the subject matter of the complaint may touch on a sensitive issue that is important to the laws of either the original jurisdiction or the alternative forum. Those public policy issues must be pinpointed, analyzed and briefed in a way that makes it clear why this issue overrides the other factors. For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers. See the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]] (FELA) for further reference.

Additional factors include:
* The location where the cause of action arose. In most states, defendant must usually show that the cause of action arose outside of the jurisdiction.
* The identities of the parties. Who is suing whom? Is the plaintiff suing an individual defendant or a small company without financial means as a method to oppress the defendant with financial and legal costs by litigating in a remote court? Is the defendant a conglomerate making the FNC application simply to force the plaintiff to bear expensive costs of travel and retainer of foreign lawyers? A plaintiff who is a resident in the state where action was filed is normally entitled to have his case heard in his home state.
* Vexatious motive. Where there is no evidence that the plaintiff had improper intent in bringing the case specifically in a particular forum, courts usually deny the FNC motion.
* Jurisprudential development and political conditions at the foreign forum. Is the court going to send the plaintiff to a land where the law is underdeveloped, uncivilized, or where there is no ''[[equal protection]]'' or ''[[due process]]''?  Is the court going to send the plaintiff to another court in a country where violence is rampant or in the middle of a war? A suit will not be dismissed if the foreign court does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the complaint, no live testimony of the plaintiff is required by appearance, or if the foreign law is otherwise deficient in its protocols or procedures.

The determination of the court may not be arbitrary or abusive as this is a drastic remedy to be applied with caution and restraint.

As for the transfer of a trial to a jurisdiction outside of the U.S., courts will only grant the transfer if a foreign court is “more appropriate”, and there may be a real opportunity to obtain justice there.

&lt;!-- The following section needs a rewrite for readability. I can’t even tell how some of the sentences are relevant or what cases that they apply to. --&gt;
In New York, for example, there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff’s choice of forum. See Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); R. Maganlal &amp; Co., 942 F.2d 164, 167 (2nd Cir. 1991); Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2000); and Maran Coal Corp. V. Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., No. 92 CIV 8728, 1993 US.Dist. LEXIS 12160 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. September 2, 1993). A defendant must show compelling evidence in order to disturb the choice of forum. The burden of proof is on the defendant: Strategic Value Master Fund, Ltd. v. Cargill Fin. Serv. Corp., 421 F.2d 741, 754 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The court must also consider the defendant’s vast resources compared with the plaintiff’s limited resources as an aggrieved individual: See Wiwa at 107: “defendants have not demonstrated that these costs [of shipping documents and witnesses] are excessively burdensome, especially in view of defendant’s vast resources”. Also, Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) at 341: “A countervailing factor is the relative means of the parties”.
&lt;!-- This is the end of the section previously commented upon. --&gt;

In 2006, the 2nd Circuit Federal Court in New York issued a decision in the famous Coca-Cola case. Coca-Cola took over assets of Jews expelled from Egypt in the 1950s and was sued in New York. Bigio v. Coca-Cola Company, 448 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2006), ''certiorari'' to Sup. Ct. denied. In that case, the plaintiffs were Canadians and non‐residents of New York. The court denied Coca-Cola’s FNC motion and the U.S. Supreme Court denied ''certiorari''. The 2nd Circuit stated that the fact that the New York court would need to apply “modest application” of Egyptian law was not a problem because “courts of this Circuit are regularly called upon to interpret foreign law without thereby offending the principles of international comity”. Also, the fact that there were witnesses abroad was not a problem either. They could be flown into the U.S. or Letters Rogatory could be issued to the Egyptian courts to collect their testimony. Further, it was held that in an FNC scenario, a court applies the balance of conveniences, but preference (and weight) must be given to the fact that plaintiffs chose this particular forum for “legitimate reasons”. The fact that plaintiffs could sue in Canada was not relevant because Coca-Cola was a U.S. company and it was “perfectly reasonable to sue in the US”.

==Europe==
The doctrine of FNC gained little footing in the civil law world, which prefers the approach of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'' (see Articles 21-23 Brussels Convention). The civil law jurisdictions generally base jurisdiction on the residence of the defendant and on [[choice of law]] rules favouring the [[habitual residence]] of the parties, the ''[[lex situs]]'', and the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'' (applying ''actor sequitur forum rei''). This reflects an expectation that a defendant should be sued at his "own" courts, modified to reflect different priorities in certain types of case. As an example of this expectation, Article 2 [[Brussels I Regulation]] (as well as the corresponding Lugano conventions) provides:
{{quote|
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, persons domiciled in a Contracting State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that State.

Persons who are not nationals of the State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules of jurisdiction applicable to nationals of that State.
}}

But this is subject to the substantial exceptions contained in Articles 3–6, the limitations on insurance actions in Articles 7–12, and consumer contracts in Articles 13–15. Article 16 also grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to specified jurisdictions as the ''lex situs'' of immovable property and a ''res'', and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the enforcement of judgments. Subsequent articles allow [[forum selection clause]]s and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum. The Brussels Regime therefore represents a harmonised set of rules for the determination of all questions of jurisdiction throughout the EU and [[EFTA]] (but not Liechtenstein) excluding FNC.

==Shipping==
The issue of FNC arises in shipping cases since different parties may be involved as charterers or [[consignee]]s and because of the international nature of the [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[Maritime law|maritime]] trade. Despite several different [[Treaty|convention]]s dealing with aspects of international trade, jurisdictional disputes are common. Moreover, in some instances, a case in the [[United States]] may be initiated under U.S. state law when [[Admiralty law#United States|Admiralty law]] (which is a Federal jurisdiction) would be the more appropriate forum. If this occurs, the case may be removed to the Federal Courts or to the courts of another state on FNC grounds.

For example, suppose that a container ship comes into port in [[Miami, Florida]], United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in [[Denmark]]. Made aware of the ship's presence, a local [[lawyer]] moves to impose a [[lien]] which involves a form of arrest by means of ''[[trial de novo|de novo]]'' proceedings ''in rem''. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an [[agent (law)|agent]] to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are [[England|English]]). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court is not in a good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in [[demurrage]] to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of [[enforcement of foreign judgments|enforcement]], the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the ''forum conveniens'' because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful. Joyce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=P|title=The Rule of Freedom: Liberalism and the Modern City|year=2003|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenges Foucauldian notions of Panopticism, contending that neoliberal governmentality is more adequately conceptualised by an omniopticon - 'the many surveilling the many'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S|author2=Leszczy, L|title=Privacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb|journal=Geoforum|year=2010|volume=42|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative mapping]] initiatives utilising [[GPS]] technology are arguably omniopticons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingsbury|first=P|author2=Jones, J.P|title=Walter Benjamin's Dionysian Adventures on Google Earth|journal=Geoforum|year=2009|volume=40|issue=4|pages=502–513|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to reverse the panoptic [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Natios |first=D |title=Reversing the Panopticon |url=http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |accessdate=29 October 2011 |author2=Young, Y |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211004/http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to health care ===

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

== Synopsis ==

''How to Lose Your Virginity'' explores the concept of virginity from historical origins of the word, [[virgin]], to the modern day definitions perpetuated in popular culture. The film takes a critical look at how virginity is ‘restored’ through [[hymenoplasty]], fetishized by [[pornography]], and celebrated at [[purity balls]]. Linking virginity culture to commerce, the film follows [[Moonlite Bunny Ranch|Natalie Dylan]]'s [[virginity auction]] and the sales of [[artificial hymen]] on the internet. Shechter also visits the set of [[Barely Legal (magazine)|''Barely Legal'']] and discusses the success of the "virginity porn" genre. ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' questions the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education| Abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observes how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman’s morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|work=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Sadie|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|work=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

The film was directed by [[Therese Shechter]], whose production company Trixie Films is based in Brooklyn. Working with Producer Lisa Esselstein, ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' was shot over several years in the U.S. and Canada. Other films produced by Trixie Films include the documentary feature ''[[I Was A Teenage Feminist]]'' and the documentary shorts "How I Learned to Speak Turkish" and "#slutwalknyc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shechter was inspired to make the film because of the growing abstinence until marriage movement and her own experiences as an older virgin. While making the film, Shechter became engaged and incorporated trying on white wedding dresses into the film as a way of looking at how the wedding industry sells virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Human rights and development''' aims converge in many instances and are beneficial only to the government and not the people although there can be conflict between their different approaches. Today,{{when|date=September 2016}} a [[human rights]]-based approach is viewed by many as essential to achieving development goals. Historically, the "minority clauses" guaranteeing civil and political rights and religious and cultural toleration to minorities were significant acts emerging from the peace process of World War I relating to a peoples rights to self-determination. Overseen by the [[League of Nations Council]] the process allowed petitions from individuals and was monitored under the jurisdiction of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. The 'clauses' are an important early signpost in both the human rights and development histories.

==Human rights history==
{{Main|Human rights}}

The initial impetus of the current human rights legal regime and movement was in reaction to the Nazi atrocities of World War II. Human Rights are importantly referred to in the [[United Nations Charter]]&lt;ref name="ISBN 13: 9789210020251"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Nations Charter|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/|publisher=United Nations, Department of Public Information|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the Preamble and under Article 1 though only sparingly. The preamble of the UN Charter reaffirms "faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women". Article 2(4) however prohibits the use of force and has ever since be used to block humanitarian actions though Chapter VII provides for Security Council enforcement measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson QC|first=Geoffrey|title=Crimes Against Humanity|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0141-97483-5|pages=33–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter established the Economic and Social council which set up the UN [[Human Rights Commission]] now the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Chapter VI of the Charter entitled International Economic and Social Cooperation provides Article 55 (c) the "universal respect for, and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion". Article 56 requires States to take joint and separate actions in cooperation with the UN to achieve their mutual aims. Human rights are inherent in the progress of economic social and cultural goals and therefore to [[Human development (humanity)|Human Development]] as such.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is not binding law and reflects an unwillingness of [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] to codify an [[International Bill of Rights]] where fears that colonial interests would be negatively affected were still influential. Human rights are viewed as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. [[René Cassin]] one of the architects of the declaration conceived the rights as divided into 4 pillars supporting the roof a temple, "[[dignity]], [[liberty]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and brotherhood". Articles 1 &amp; 2 comprising the first pillar relates to human 'dignity' shared by all individuals regardless of religion, creed, ethnicity, religion, or sex. Articles 100-19 the second pillar invokes [[first-generation rights]] civil 'liberties' fought for during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Articles 20-26 the third pillar are [[second-generation rights]], relating to political, social and economic equity, championed during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Articles 27-28 the fourth pillar are [[third-generation rights]] associated with community and national [[solidarity]] advocated from the late 19th. These pillars support the roof of the temple Articles 29-30 representing the conditions in society under which the rights of individuals can be realized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ishay|first=Micheline R|title=What are human rights? Six historical controversies|journal=Journal of Human Rights|year=2004|volume=3|issue=3|page=359|doi=10.1080/1475483042000224897|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1475483042000224897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain civil and political rights converging with development aims include Article 2 which entitles everyone to rights with distinction as to race, colour, sex, or language; Article 3 the rights to life, liberty and security of person; Article 8 the right to effective remedy and Article 9 the right to an independent tribunal; Article 19 entails freedom of expression and Article 20 freedom of peaceful assembly; Article 21 is the right to participate in government and Article 26 provides rights to education.

Article 28 importantly signifies ' Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration can be fully realized. The right calls for enforcement mechanisms and echoes Chapter VII of the UN Charter permitting security council intervention for human rights violations on a scale that threatens world peace. The UN Charter allows for a limit to state sovereignty were Human Rights are threatened. Two critiques of the declaration are that it did not make [[political rights]] dependent on [[multi-party democracy]] and there is a lack of protection for [[ethnic minorities]], protecting individual rights do not necessarily protect group rights.

The nexus between grave human rights violations and [[international security]] is significant as atrocities within a [[sovereign state]] are of concern to [[international law]], when they upset neighbouring states in a manner disturbing to world peace. Article 55 of the Charter states "promotion of the respect for human rights helps create conditions of stability" and "recognition of ... equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation ... of peace in the world". Taken together the United Nations Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights provide a legal mechanism which may challenge the sovereign rights of States to oppress people within their own jurisdiction

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (VDPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/vienna.aspx|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirms the [[right to development]] under part 1, paragraph 10 and was adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]]1993. The United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] was created by the declaration and endorsed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) under resolution 48/121.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Conference on Human Rights.

All elements were accorded equal weight and the [[Declaration (law)|declaration]] defined the rights and obligations of nations in 27 principles and recognizes "the polluter pays" as its guiding tenet.

The Action 2 Plan of Action and work plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action 2 Initiative|url=https://www.un.org/events/action2/|accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; stems from the [[UN Secretary General]] report Strengthening of the United Nations; An Agenda for Further Change. Integrating human rights into humanitarian, development and peace keeping work throughout the UN system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengthening human rights-related United Nations action at country level: Plan of Action|url=https://www.un.org/events/action2/action2plan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan introduces the UN Common Learning Package and a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human rights-based approach to development programming. (HRBA)|url=http://www.undg.org/content/programming_reference_guide_(undaf)/un_country_programming_principles/human_rights-based_approach_to_development_programming_(hrba)|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which builds on the experience of all agencies.

The emphasis of the HRBA is based on common understanding and requires that 1) all programmes of development co-operation, policies and technical assistance should further the realisation of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments; 2) human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process and 3) development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of 'duty-bearers' to meet their obligations and/or of 'rights-holders' to claim their rights.

The major human rights principles guiding the programme are regarded as universality and inalienability; indivisibility; interdependence and interrelatedness; non-discrimination and equality; participation and inclusion; accountability and the rule of law.

==The Declaration on the Right to Development==
{{Main|Right to development}}

The Declaration on the Right to Development was proclaimed by the UNGA under resolution 41/128 in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration on the Right to Development.  A/RES/41/128|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r128.htm|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only the United States voting against the resolution and eight absentions. The United Nations recognizes no hierarchy of rights, and all human rights are equal and interdependent, the right to development then is not an umbrella right that encompasses or trumps other rights nor is it a right with the status of a mere political aspiration.

The [[Right to development]] is regarded as an inalienable human right which all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development. The right includes 1) people-centred development, identifying "the human person" as the central subject, participant and beneficiary of development; 2) a human rights-based approach specifically requiring that development is to be carried out in a manner "in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized"; 3) participation, calling for the "active, free and meaningful participation" of people in development; 4) equity, underlining the need for "the fair distribution of the benefits" of development; 5) non-discrimination, permitting  "no distinction as to race, sex, language or religion"; and 6) self-determination, the declaration integrates self-determination, including full sovereignty over natural resources, as a constituent element of the right to development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development is a Human Right for All|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/IntroductionStatement.aspx|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right is a third generation right viewed as a group right such that it is owed to communities as opposed to an individual right applying to individuals "It is a people, not an individual, that is entitled to the right to self-determination and to national and global development"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sucharitkul|first=Sompong|title=The Concept of Human Rights in International Law.|journal=International Sustainable Development Law|volume=1. Vol. I - The Nature And Sources Of International Development Law|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One obstacle to the right is in the difficult process of defining 'people' for the purposes of self- determination. Additionally, most developing states voice concerns about the negative impacts of aspects of international trade, unequal access to technology and crushing debt burden and hope to create binding obligations to facilitate development as a way of improving governance and the rule of law. The right to development embodies three additional attributes which clarify its meaning and specify how it may reduce poverty 1) The first is a holistic approach which integrates human rights into the process 2) an enabling environment offers fairer terms in the economic relations for developing countries and 3) the concept of social justice and equity involves the participation of the people of countries involved and a fair distribution of developmental benefits with special attention given to marginalised and vulnerable members of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moeckli et all|first=Daniel|title=International Human Rights Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right was first recognised in 1981 under Article 22 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the [[Arab Charter on Human Rights]]. It is now recognised in numerous international instruments, with the Rio Declaration asserting under principle 1 "Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development, they are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature". Other instruments include the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm], Millennium Declaration&lt;/ref&gt; the 2002 [[Monterrey Consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/aconf198-11.pdf, Montery Report]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2005 World Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/ods/A-RES-60-1-E.pdf], Outcome Document&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2007 [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf.]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, DRIP&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 3 provides that "States have the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development" and this encompasses three main levels 1) States acting collectively in global and regional partnerships; 2) States acting individually as they adopt and implement policies that affect persons not strictly within their jurisdiction and 3) States acting individually as they formulate national development policies and programmes affecting persons within their jurisdiction.

Article 6 importantly provides "States should undertake, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to development, echoing Article 2.1 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) which states that "each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources. Furthermore, the Maastricht Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masstricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/Maastrichtguidelines_.html|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; on violations of economic, social and cultural rights provides that a state is in violation of the Covenant if it fails to allocate the maximum of its available resources to realizing human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum Available Resources &amp; Human Rights|url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/docman/economic-and-social-rights-publications/362-maximumavailableresources-pdf/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A/RES/48/141|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r141.htm|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  seeks "to promote and protect the realization of the right to development and to enhance support from relevant bodies of the UN system for this purpose." The right to development is highlighted in the General Assembly and the HRC which both request the [[UN Secretary-General]] and the HC to report annually on progress in the implementation of the right to development including activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development between Member States, development agencies and international development, financial and trade institutions.

The U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted by consensus a resolution on the Right to Development 1998/24 ." Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and, in particular, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Human Rights. Report of the 54th Session |url=https://www.un.org/en/terrorism/pdfs/2/G9814179.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission recommended a follow up mechanism consisting of an open ended working group (OEWG) and an Independent Expert, [[Arjun Kumar Sengupta]] and Indian economist who  was selected to the post . The purpose of the working group was to monitor and review the progress of the Independent Expert and report back to the Commission. The Independent Expert presented to the working group at each of its sessions a study on the current state of progress in the implementation of the right to development.

==Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers==
{{Main|Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper}}

Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) were first introduced in 1999 as a condition of eligibility for debt relief among Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). The rationale of the  process was to promote national and local 'ownership' of macroeconomic policies ensuring that they were sufficiently adapted to relieving poverty in the poorest countries. The process represents an embrace of the values of participation and transparency in the formulation of macroeconomic policy, and thus has the potential to shape the content of these policies in order to meet the needs of the poor.

(PRSP's) are prepared by member countries in a participatory process with domestic stakeholders and development partners like the [[World Bank]] or [[International Monetary Fund]]. These are updated every three years with progress reports describing the country's macroeconomic, structural and social policies and programs over a three-year or longer period to promote growth and reduce poverty. Interim PRSPs (I-PRSPs) summarize the current knowledge and analysis of a country's poverty situation, describe the existing poverty reduction strategy, and lay out the process for producing a fully developed PRSP in a participatory fashion.

Country documents, along with the accompanying IMF/World Bank Joint Staff Assessments (JSAs), are available on their websites by agreement with the member country as a service to users of the IMF and World Bank websites. The introduction of PRSPs was a recognition by the IMF and the World Bank of the importance of country ownership of reform programs as well as the need for a greater focus on poverty reduction. PRSPs aim to provide the crucial link between national public actions, donor support, and the development outcomes needed to meet the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are centered on halving poverty between 1990 and 2015. PRSPs guide policies associated concessional lending as well as debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.

Five core principles underlie the approach. Poverty reduction strategies should be 1) country-driven, promoting national ownership of strategies through broad-based participation of civil society; 2) result-oriented and focused on outcomes that will benefit the poor; 3) comprehensive in recognizing the multidimensional nature of poverty; 4) partnership-oriented, involving coordinated participation of development partners (government, domestic stakeholders, and external donors); and 5) based on a long-term perspective for poverty reduction.

In 2001 The UN [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] commissioned the 2001 guidelines for the integration of human rights into poverty reduction Strategies which were further developed in the 2005 guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/PovertyStrategiesen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioner in a concept note also states that the human rights framework is "a useful tool strengthening the accountability and equity dimensions of the Poverty Reductions Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers – Progress in Implementation 2005 PRS Review|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/PRSP-Review/un_ohchr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 specific strategies were introduced in regards to Poverty Reduction and Health that affirmed the place of Human Rights in the achievement of the Millennium goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights, Health and Poverty Reduction Strategies|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/ESCR/Health/HHR_PovertyReductionsStrategies_WHO.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rights and the Millennium Development Goals==
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals}}

In September 2000, world leaders made commitments in the [[Millennium Declaration]] UN resolution 55/2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Millennium Declaration. A/RES/55/2|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; on topics that included peace, security, human rights, the environment and development targets which were later configured into the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These goals are sets of development targets that center on halving poverty and improving the welfare of the world's poorest by 2015. The [[IMF]] contributes to the goals through advice, technical assistance, lending to countries and mobilizing donor support.

The Millennium Declaration considers six fundamental values necessary for international relations 1) [[Liberty|freedom]] to raise children in dignity, freedom from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression  and injustice, including democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people. 2) [[equal opportunity|equality]], no individual or nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development. 3) [[solidarity]], global inequities must be managed to distribute costs and burdens fairly in accordance with the principles of equity and social justice, while those who benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most. 4) [[Toleration|tolerance]], differences within and between societies should not be feared or repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity, while cultures of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be promoted. 5) Respect for nature. Prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources, through [[sustainable development]] and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption must be changed in the interest of the future welfare of our descendants and 6) shared responsibility, responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally.

Human rights have played a limited role in influencing MDG planning, though there are strong similarities between them and the content of the MDGs which resemble many economic and social rights. MDGs provide benchmarks for economic and social rights, while human rights strategies offer enhanced legitimacy, equity and sustainability to the MDG policies. The Millennium Declaration substantially refers to human rights and leaders have committed themselves to respecting recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development. Economic, social and cultural rights, the rights of women, migrant, minorities, and participation are all emphasized in the declaration yet the pursuit of the MDGs has been in isolation from it. MDG targets are not sufficiently focused on inequalities within a country and human rights instruments require a minimum core level of economic, social and cultural rights to be immediately realized for all and for all discrimination in the exercise of rights to be eliminated. Inequalities within countries lead to violent conflict and countries focus on the relatively well-off among the poor in order to reach a particular MDG target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, Human Rights Perspectives on the Millennium Development Goals: Conference Report (New York: NYU School of Law, 2003).|url=http://www.chrgj.org/images/NYUCHRGJMDGREPORT2003.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDGs are accompanied by 18 targets measured by 60 indicators though the relationship between the goals, targets and indicators is not always clear. A range of activities are promoted as a means of achieving the MDGs such as tailoring the MDGs to the regional, national and local context and undertaking national needs assessments and monitoring progress through yearly MDG reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claiming the Millennium Development Goals|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Claiming_MDGs_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-State actors also carry human rights responsibilities with at least a minimum duty of not interfering with human rights such as the [[OECD]] [[Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a complaint system for violations by companies. A specific critique of MDGs is that they place emphasis on the mobilization of financial resources and technical solutions, but less on transforming power relations that are partially responsible for levels of poverty. The [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Bank|url=http://www.worldbank.org/|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; has observed that in many situations the real barriers to progress on the MDGs are social and political. The realization of human rights therefore may be a precondition to fulfilling development goals

===Poverty===

The present global institutional order is foreseeably associated with avoidable severe poverty and its impositions may constitute an ongoing human rights violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pogge|first=Thomas|title=World Poverty &amp; Human Rights|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745641430}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many measures of poverty and it is now regarded that poverty is more than the measure of a low income. [[Amartya Sen]] argues that individual physical characteristics, environmental and social conditions as well as behavioural expectations all play a role. The UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] defines poverty as "human conditions characterised by chronic deprivation of resources capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living"

[[Jeffrey Sachs]] place poverty in an historical trajectory with the ending of slavery, colonialism, segregation and apartheid but do not link these human rights movements to current causes of poverty elimination. Policy economists discuss minimum standards, transparency, and participation unrelated to the human rights framework where poverty is seen to increases social wastage distorting economic and service delivery outcomes. [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in ''Making Globalization Work'' refers to a gap between economic and political globalization and that a growth oriented economic analysis disregarding the impact of income on the realization of rights such as health or education and focusing instead on making choices in a world of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moeckli et all|first=Daniel|title=International Human Rights Law.|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956025-7|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate whether attention to civil and political rights makes way for economic development or whether economic growth is more likely to create institutional and political development. The [[G-20]] 2005 Statement on Global Development Issues does not mention human rights or human development and good governance is referred to only in relation to economic policy. In the 2009 the Global Plan for Recovery and Reform &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Plan for Recovery and Reform|url=http://www.g20ys.org/upload/files/London_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also fails to mention human rights or human development. The ingrained philosophy is a world economy based on market principles and effective regulation.

A strand of economics embraces human rights language such as the International Development Ethics Association &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Development Ethics Association|url=http://developmentethics.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who apply a normative approach to development theories. The Mérida Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Merida Declaration|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/2008-merida-declaration.pdf|accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides "the absolute respect for the dignity of the human person regardless of gender, ethnic group social class, religion age or nationality. The UN Development Programme [[UNDP]] which is promoted by the [[Human Development and Capability Association]] (HDCA) is open to a human rights perspective as stated in the [[Human Development Report]] of 2001 "human development and human rights are mutually reinforcing helping to secure the well-being and dignity of all people". The Economic and Social Council put out a statement in May 2001 specifically addressing poverty as a human right concern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement adopted by the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights on May 4th 2001. E/C.12/2001/10|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/docs/statements/E.C.12.2001.10Poverty-2001.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Special Rapporteur Mohammed Habib Cherif reported to the Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights at its 58th session now the [[Advisory Committee]] on Human Rights and extreme Poverty. Human rights under these development perspectives revolve around the concept of freedom with expanding choice. The World Conference on Human Rights the Vienna Declaration confirmed that extreme poverty and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of [[extreme poverty]] and its causes.

The first MDG is to Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger. Economic growth is regarded as the principal mechanism to achieve this goal while a human rights approach requires a focus on poor growth and a consideration of groups seeking development paths other than the conventional free market, export-driven model. The targets here are 1) To halve, between by 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day comparable to the ''Right to adequate standard of living''; 2) to achieve full employment and decent work for all is comparable to the ''Right to work'' and 3) to halve by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_1_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the ''Right to food'', and correspondingly rights to life and health.

South-eastern Asia is the first developing region to reach the hunger reduction target ahead of 2015. Undernourished people in the total population of the region decreased from 29.6% in 1990-1992 to 10.9% in 2010-2012. However, globally the slowing of growth brings continual job losses. Unemployment has increased by 28 million since 2007, and an estimated 39 million people have dropped out of the labour market, leaving 67 million people without jobs as a result of the global financial crisis. Though the number of workers living with their families on less than $1.25 a day has declined dramatically over the past decade by 294 million, new estimates show that 60.9% of workers in the developing world still live on less than $4 a day.

In Yemen the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) Food For Girls Education Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food for Girls In Education|url=http://www.wfp.org/stories/food-gets-girls-school-yemen}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been tackling hunger and enrolment challenges, where more than 60% of primary school children not in schools are girls. Families who send their girls to school are eligible to receive an annual ration of wheat and vegetable oil. Since 2010 the programme has reached almost 200,000 girls. Whilst in India the [[UNDP]] is supporting the [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Program]], promoting laws passed in 2005 which guarantee the right to a minimum of 100 days of paid work a year for landless labourers and marginal farmers. The scheme now provides 50 days work a year to around 50 million households where almost half of the beneficiaries are women.

The [[Zero Hunger Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Hunger Challenge|url=https://www.un.org/en/zerohunger/challenge.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; another UN initiative with numerous [[NGO]] partners has as it aims 1) 100% access to adequate food all year round; 2) zero stunted children less than 2 years old; 3) where all food systems are sustainable; 4) a 100% increase in smallholder productivity and income; and 5) a zero loss or waste of food.

===Education===

[[Varun Gauri]] argues that economic and social rights, such as the right to health care or education, may be understood not as legal instruments for individuals, but as duties for governments and international agencies such that everyone bears some responsibility for their fulfillment. Economists accept that the realization of high standards of health and education are conducive to economic growth. The human rights approach regards transparency and empowerment as ends in themselves, while an economic approach sees them as instrumental to a welfare outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alston et all|first=Phillip|title=Human Rights and Development Towards Mutual Reinforcement.|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press.|location=Oxford|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second MDG is to [[Achieve Universal Primary Education]]. The target is to ensure that by 2015, children everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal2: Achieve universal primary education|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_2_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  comparable to the ''Right to education'',  the goal however ignores the requirement of ''free primary education'' as conceived by the human right. 
 
Even after 4 years of primary schooling, as many as 250 million children cannot read and write undermining the basis for all future learning. Going to school is not enough and improving actual learning is critical. Early school leaving is a major factor, 137 million children entered first grade in 2011, with 34 million likely to leave before reaching the last grade, an early leaving rate of 25%, the same as in 2000. Poverty, gender and residential location are key factors keeping children out of school. Children from the poorest households are three times more likely to be out of school than children from the richest households. Globally 123 million youth aged 15 to 24 lack basic reading and writing skills whilst 61% of them are young women.

Positive developments have occurred in Afghanistan and Bangladesh where the [[Let Us Learn initiative]] has overcome barriers to education. [[UNICEF]] enrolled 3,917 five-year-olds in school programmes, including 153 disabled children from the most disadvantaged region of rural Bangladesh, 60% of which were girls. In Afghanistan 9,339 children and youth participated in community based learning programmes with 84% being girls. UNICEF and partners responded to 286 humanitarian crises in 79 countries in 2012 and helped some 3.56 million children and adolescents gain access to formal and non formal basic education.

The Secretary-General's [[Global Education First initiative]] (GEFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Education First Initiative|url=http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a commitment with companies and private foundations making pledges of over $1.5 billion ensuring that all children have a quality, relevant and transformative education, whilst the [[Global Partnership for Education]] (GPE) helped more than 19 million children go to school since 2003. Leading donors promised an initial $1.5 billion over three years, with the fund aiming to secure another 25 million children in school as of 2014.

===Gender equality===

The third MDG is to promote [[gender equality]] and [[women empowerment|empower women]]. Eliminating gender inequality is supported by international human rights instruments, such as the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]]. The goal sets women's empowerment as the objective but the related target is narrowly concerned with education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal3: Promote gender equality and empower women|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_3_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2015 is narrowly conceived but comparable to Women's Right to [[Gender equality|equality]]. Of note the share of women employed outside of agriculture rose to 40% in 2013 but only by 20% in Southern Asia, Western Asia and Northern Africa while the global share of women in parliament continues to rise and reached 20% in 2012.

Gender gaps in access to education have narrowed but inequalities remain in all levels of education, girls face barriers to schooling, particularly in Northern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia. Access to secondary and university education remains unequal with disparities at universities the most extreme. In Southern Asia, 77 girls per 100 boys are enrolled in tertiary education while in sub-Saharan Africa the gender gap in enrolment has widened from 66 girls per 100 boys in 2000 to 61 girls per 100 boys in 2011. Poverty is the main cause of unequal access to education with women and girls in many parts of the world forced to spend many hours fetching water and girls often do not attend school because of a lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Child marriage and violence against girls are also significant barriers to education. Women still enter the labour market on an unequal basis to men, even after accounting for educational background and skills. Women are often relegated to vulnerable forms of employment, with little or no financial security or social benefits.

Regarding women's rights and land empowerment, [[Kerry Rittich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Kerry Rittich|url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/full-time-faculty/kerry-rittich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  notes that programmes which promote the formal real property rights of women, in place of customary laws or other informal mechanisms, have the potential to both improve and retard women's access to land. The programmes promoting property rights tend to go together with measures to formalize, commodify, and individualize landholdings, and that these three processes often intensify the dispossession of women who may have had access to land under informal arrangements or customary law. The promotion of property rights from an economic perspective may well undermine the social rights of women in developing countries. Legal conceptions of property, treat property not as a mere resource but as a set of relations between individuals and groups. This approach may highlight otherwise unforeseen distributive consequences for women, moving from an informal property regime to a formalized and individualized one.

Mason and Carlsson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alston et all|first=Phillip|title=Human Rights and Development Towards Mutual Reinforcement.|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press.|location=Oxford:}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that, unless gender inequality in land holding is taken into account when implementing land tenure reforms, improved land tenure security may diminish women's land holdings. A variety of factors can lead to this result, including discriminatory inheritance laws, the application of an androcentric definition of 'the head of household', and inequalities in women's capacity to participate in the market for land. Costa Rica and Colombia land reforms were undertaken in a way that improved women's ownership of land. Women who own the land they work have greater incentives to raise their labour productivity, and women who earn more income are more likely than men to invest in the household and in their children's education and nutrition stressing the importance of applying a human rights lens such that norms of non-discrimination and equal property rights are required when implementing economic reforms.

===Children's rights===
{{Main article|Children's rights}}
The fourth MDG is to reduce [[child mortality]]. A human rights approach emphasizes the State's obligations regarding the availability of functioning health systems and making sure that all groups can effectively access them by addressing obstacles like discrimination. The target here is the reduction of two-thirds of the mortality rate of children under five by 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal4: Reduce child mortality|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_4_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  comparable to the ''Right to life''. Around 17,000 fewer children are dying each day, yet 6.6 million children under five died in 2012, mostly from preventable diseases. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in ten children dies before the age five.

Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounted for 5.3 million 81% of the 6.6 million deaths The main killers are pneumonia, prenatal and intrapartum complications, diarrhoea and malaria. The first month, particularly the first 24 hours, are the most dangerous in a child's life. Newborns now account for almost half 44% of under-five deaths and undernutrition contributes to 45% of all under-five deaths. Over the past two decades in Bangladesh UNICEF has supported local efforts training community health-care workers leading to a decline in maternal and child mortality. Infant mortality declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 33 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012. In the same period under five mortality dropped by 72% from 144 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 41 deaths per 1000 births in 2012.

The development goal is related to ''Child Labour''. Rights advocates regard child labour as a violation to numerous rights of a child such that it must be eradicated to ensure children's human rights are ends themselves while development economics views child labour as an inter-generational loss of potential income. Children suffer diminished human capital where reductions in health and education affect their future productivity. The International Labour Organization's (ILO's) estimates that current levels of child labour will result in an income foregone of $5 trillion between 2000 and 2020. Currently 23% of the world's children aged between 5 and 17 are engaged in some form of work. [[Betcherman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alston et all|first=Phillip|title=Human Rights and Development Towards Mutual Reinforcement|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates the important insights that economic analysis can provide in understanding how best to reduce child labour. Factors contributing to child labour can be seen in terms of incentives that encourage child work, constraints that compel children to work, and decisions that may not be made in the best interests of the children. Other factors must also be considered, direct (books, transport) and indirect (poor quality, loss of household labour) costs of education leading parents to regard education as not providing sufficient immediate returns to the household or child.

[[Elizabeth Gibbons]], [[Friedrich Huebler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Education Statistics – Analysis by Friedrich Huebler|url=http://huebler.blogspot.co.nz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Edilberto Loaiza]] consider how, at the level of statistical analysis, the application of the human rights principle of non-discrimination can affect our understanding of child labour. Existing methods of calculating the extent of child labour under report the degree of work done by girls, because the measures exclude household chores. By failing to consider 'female work' within the definition of child labour, the impact of child work on the educational and health attainment of girls is made invisible. Gibbons, Huebler, and Loaiza also investigate some factors affecting school attendance; labour and household poverty are generally constraints on attendance but a mother's educational attainment correlates positively with school attendance, revealing the inter-generational payoff from investments in girls' education. Household wealth and the level of education of the primary caretaker also have a significant effect on educational attainment

In India the [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/rte}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to the inclusion of a justiciable right to education in relation to children between the ages of 6 and 14 and provides an impetus to government to address critical problems in the provision of education. The idea of education as a 'fundamental right'  focuses local political action and agitation among oppressed communities, who rely on the new constitutional provision as a way of pressing demands on local and regional government.

===Maternal health===

The fifth MDG is to improve [[maternal health]]. The target is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio and to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal5: Improve maternal health|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_5_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  comparable to ''right to life and health''. Complications during pregnancy or childbirth are one of the leading causes of death for adolescent girls, 140 million women worldwide married or in civil union would like to delay or avoid pregnancy, but have no access to family planning. 47 million babies were delivered without skilled care in 2011.

Maternal mortality is lower in countries where levels of contraceptive use and skilled attendance at birth are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal mortality ratio|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio with a contraceptive use of 25% and low levels of skilled attendance at birth. Education for girls is vital to reducing maternal mortality. The risk of maternal death is 2.7 times higher among women with no education, and 2 times higher among women with one to six years of education than for women with twelve plus years of education.

Supported by UNFPA, Bangladesh is training midwives according to international midwifery standards. Hundreds of nurses have upgraded their knowledge with practical and theoretical training. In India more than two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in impoverished states due to the inability to get medical care in time. UNICEF and its partners are working to avoid these preventable maternal deaths through innovative schemes such as a [[conditional cash transfer]] programme for women who deliver in health facilities. In Sierra Leone a year after the launch of the Free Health Care 2010 initiative there was a 150%  improvement in maternal complications managed in health facilities and a 61% reduction in the maternal mortality rate.

Launched at the UN MDG Summit in 2010, [[Every Woman Every Child]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Every Women Every Child|url=http://www.everywomaneverychild.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobilizes global action to save the lives of women and children and to improve their health and lives. Partners in this area include The [[GAVI Matching Fund for Immunization]], a private-public initiative in which the UK Department for International Development and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] match contributions from the private sector to deliver critical vaccines to the lowest income countries. Furthermore, UN Women is implementing a joint programme in Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea, Haiti, Mali, Niger and Togo highlighting links between violence against women and maternal health, promoting funding and training midwives and health workers.

===Combating disease===

This sixth MDG is to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other diseases. The goal has three targets 1) to halt and reverse HIV/AIDS, 2) to achieve universal treatment for HIV/AIDs 3) to halt and reverse Malaria and other Diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_6_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; unquestionably reflecting the ''Right to health''. To date 2.3 million people are newly infected by HIV each year, with 1.6 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Tuberculosis (TB) mortality rate decreased 41% between 1991 and 2011, yet TB killed 1.4 million people in 2011, including 430,000 among people who were HIV-positive. [[Multidrug-resistant TB]] is a major global challenge and the rate of people accessing treatment is slow.

In 2008, reports appeared that malaria parasites in Cambodia and Thailand were resisting artemisinin, the most effective single drug to treat malaria. The countries launched a joint monitoring, prevention and treatment project in seven provinces along their shared border, with support from WHO. In Thailand more than 300 volunteer village malaria health workers were trained to provide free services to test for malaria and directly observe the treatment of patients. Use of a smart phone to capture data on patients and to monitor treatment has accelerated progress. An electronic malaria information system (e-MIS) uploaded on the health workers' mobile devices shows malaria volunteers where to find patients, the status of their treatment, the situation and trends. In Ethiopia a programme, supported by UNICEF and its partners, is preventing transmission of the virus from HIV-positive mothers to their children, a critical measure in ensuring an AIDS-free generation.

The [[Getting to Zero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting to Zero|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2010/jc2034_unaids_strategy_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative has ten Southeast Asian nations committed to making Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination and Zero HIV- Related Deaths a reality.

===Environmental sustainability===

The seventh MDG is to ensure [[environmental sustainability]]. A human rights approach to sustainable development emphasizes improving accountability systems, access to information on environmental issues, and the obligations of developed States to assist more vulnerable States, especially those affected by climate change.

There are four targets in this goal 1) To integrate principles of sustainable development into country policies and reverse the loss of environmental resources comparable to a ''Right to environmental health''; 2) to reduce biodiversity loss by achieving a significant reduction in the rate of loss; 3) to halve by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation comparable to the ''Right to water and sanitation'' and 4) to achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal7: Ensure environmental sustainability|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_7_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  comparable to the ''Right to adequate housing''.

Of note a staggering 2.5 billion people still do not have access to toilets or latrines. Open defecation is a practice that poses serious health and environmental risks and stopping it is a key factor in the progress of sanitation goals. In 2013, UN Member States adopted the [[Sanitation for All]] resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanitation for All|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/GA%20Sanitation%20for%20All%20resolution%2024%20July.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  calling for increased efforts to improve access to proper sanitation. The number of slum dwellers however continues to grow, due to the fast pace of urbanization. The number of urban residents living in slum conditions was estimated at 863 million in 2012, compared to 650 million in 1990 and 760 million in 2000.

Species are moving towards extinction at an ever-faster pace, and reduced biodiversity has serious consequences for the ecosystem services upon which all people depend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alston|first=Philip|title=Human Rights and Development Towards Mutual Reinforcement|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest loss of forests occurs in South America, around 3.6 million hectares per year from 2005 to 2010. [[Deforestation]] threatens [[global sustainability]] and the progress towards hunger and poverty reduction as forests provide food, water, wood, fuel and other services used by millions of the world's poorest. Brazil's northeast the most densely populated semi-arid region in the world has limited rainfall and cyclic drought forcing many of the 22 million residents to resort in [[illegal charcoal production]], stripping the region of forests. A project by the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Fund for Agricultural Development|url=http://www.ifad.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to promote agro-ecology is showing farmers how to make a living from the land while conserving the environment.

Nearly one-third of marine fish stocks have been overexploited and the world's fisheries can no longer produce maximum sustainable yields due to continuing expansion of the fishing industry in many countries. The [[Montreal Protocol]] has led to a 98% reduction in the consumption of ozone-depleting substances since 1986 yet carbon dioxide emissions have increased by more than 46% since 1990.

Africas first transboundary biosphere reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transboundary Biosphere Reserves|url=http://www.unesco.de/fileadmin/medien/Dokumente/unesco-heute/uh2-07-p84-86.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Senegal are set up with funding from the [[Global Environment Facility]], working with the [[UN Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and [[UNESCO]] in 2002. The reserves prevent desertification, testing sustainable economies and integrating local communities.

The development goal is strongly related to rights to ''Food, Water &amp; Sanitation''. Defined as 'freedom from hunger', the right to food may be seen as a right to 'nutrition'. Nutrition is achieved not through food alone but with clean water, health-care, hygiene, and other inputs. In India despite constitutional protections of certain economic and social rights, including the right to food, and relatively stable democratic institutions, the underprivileged are excluded from actively participating in democratic politics, with the result that their aspirations and priorities are not reflected in public policy. The elitism of public policy further disempowers the poor by perpetuating their deprivations.

The state bearing primary responsibility for the right to food, there is also responsibilities on local communities and families to ensure basic nutrition is equally available to all members. Dre`ze accepts that this complicates the question of how the right to food can be enforced, additionally the right to food cannot be realized in isolation from other social and economic rights, such as the right to health.

The [[Rio +20]] Conference took place in 2012 produced the [[Future We Want]] outcome document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The future We Want. Outcome Document|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/288&amp;Lang=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and created the UN [[High-level Political Forum on sustainable development]] which issued the [[Global Sustainable Development Report in 2013]] its special theme the convergence of climate, land, energy, water and development issues. "The unabated rise in the scale of materials consumption has increased global environmental, social and economic pressures. There is increasing evidence that we are jeopardizing several of the Earth's basic life support systems. Countries and people trapped in persistent poverty have probably suffered most from these impacts. And future generations will most likely face much greater challenges to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Sustainable Development Report – Executive Summary: Building the Common Future We Want|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/975GSDR%20Executive%20Summary.pdf|location=New York|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global partnerships for development===

The eighth MDG is to [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development|develop a global partnership for development]]. There are five targets 1) to develop predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system rules; 2) to address the needs of least developed countries, landlocked countries and small island developing states; 3) to deal comprehensively with developing countries' debt; 4) to provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies and 5) to make available benefits of new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goal8: Develop a global partnership for development|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_8_fs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All targets are comparable to the ''Right to development''.

Of note a total of 83% of least developed country exports enter developed countries duty-free. In the developing world, 31% of the population use the Internet, compared with 77% of the developed world. In 2012 [[Official development assistance|ODA]] of $126 billion was 4% less than in 2011, which was 2% less than in 2010. This is the first time since 1996-1997 that ODA fell in two consecutive years, while essential medicines are available in only 57% of public sector facilities and 65% of private facilities in selected developing countries. There are over six billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and for every person who uses the Internet from a computer, two do so from a mobile device. In South Africa, over 25,000 students have improved their math skills through interactive exercises and quizzes on mobile phones through cooperation between government, Nokia and individual schools and teachers.

The [[MDG Gap Task Force]] was created by the UN Secretary-General in 2007 to improve monitoring of the global commitments contained in MDG 8 tracking existing commitments and identifying gaps and obstacles to fulfilment in development assistance, trade, debt sustainability, access to essential medicines and new technologies. The Task Force integrates more than 30 UN and other international agencies while [[The Integrated Implementation Framework]] records and monitors financial and policy commitments made by UN Member States and other international stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Partnership for Development: Making Rhetoric a Reality|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2012_Gap_Report/MDG_2012Gap_Task_Force_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and the international order==

===Post 2015 Agenda===
{{Main article|Post-2015 Development Agenda}}
Criticism of the Millennium goals are that they should be transformative not technocratic. A key element in empowering people is that the response should be framed within a broader view of poverty that addresses root causes like power inequalities. Creating an inventory of public goods and services for distribution and seeking to fill deficits through foreign aid follows the history of development. A rights-based approach seeks to identify systemic obstacles that keep people from accessing opportunity. Genuine participation and access to information are the cornerstone of empowerment and instrumental gains occur when local knowledge and local preferences are used. Civil and political rights like the rights to vote, to freedom of expression and to freedom of association are crucial if excluded groups are to ensure that Governments focus on the MDGs with a human rights basis.

Human rights in relations to develop goals possess a number of different characteristics. Rights are universal, the birthright of all humans, and are focused on the inherent dignity and equal worth of all. Human rights cannot be waived or taken away and they impose obligations of action and omission. Rights are internationally guaranteed and legally protect individuals and groups. Rights have corresponding obligations on the duty-bearer traditionally the state, who must 1) respect human rights by refraining from interfering with them; 2) protect human rights by ensuring that private actors do not interfere with people's ability to exercise them (e.g. ensure that private schools enrol children from ethnic minorities); 3) fulfil human rights by adopting all necessary measures (e.g. create health programmes to provide medicines or pass laws to recognize indigenous ancestral lands and 4) guarantee human rights without discrimination of any kind including disability, health status, age, sexual orientation, civil, political and social status.

[[International human rights law]] predate the MDGs, and States have existing legal obligations to realize human rights such that development goals targets and indicators need to be aligned with a human rights approach. The process of alignment should involve 1) adapting each target to the relevant economic, social or cultural right; 2) mainstreaming gender; 3) ensuring the excluded are included; and 4) ensuring indicators are rights sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights and the Millennium  Development Goals in Practice|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/HRAndMDGsInPractice.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There must be minimum standards for the process agreed on by all participants that includes the design, implementation and monitoring of development strategies; which are inclusive of women and marginalized groups. Elite capture and reinforcement of existing social hierarchies and power relations must be prevented and information must be transparent and accessible, finally there must be accountability mechanisms to ensure the participatory process is kept to these standards such that overall there is a prioritization of human rights in policy and resource allocation.

The [[Development CoOperation Forum]] is an initiative of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSCO) and now held biannually. The objectives of the upcoming forum include 1) Assess how a global partnership for development beyond 2015 could work in practice. 2) examine implications of a post-2015 development agenda for development cooperation; 3) identify ways to enhance national and global accountability and effective monitoring of development cooperation and 4) advance policy dialogue and concrete actions by Southern development cooperation partners on commons issues and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preparations for the Development Cooperation Forum  Phase IV: 2012-2014|url=https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/julyhls/pdf12/2012-2014_dcf_strategy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour organisations ===
{{Main|International Labour Organization}}

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) since its formation in 1919 has lent strong support to workers rights and its work compliments human rights as stipulated under Article 23 of the UDHR., Article 22 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]]. The organization has developed its own conventions and committees for advise on labour laws and mediates between trade unions and employers guarding labour principles outlined in the UN [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]].

The ILO Conventions include [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention]] 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232:NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312243:NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998 the organization issued a declaration of four core labour rights 1) freedom of association and the effective right of collective bargaining 2) the prohibition of forced compulsory labour 3) the effective abolition of child labour 4) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment or occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson QC|first=Geoffrey|title=Crimes Against Humanity] Check {{!}}url= scheme (help). London: Penguin Books|year=1999|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-141-97483-5|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bargaining may be viewed as an individual right to combine with other individual workers in a position to achieve wage justice, safe working conditions, fair disciplinary treatment and comradery. It is also a practice that counterbalances and overcomes inequalities in market forces.

The [[Fair Labor Association]] (FLA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fair Labor Association|url=http://www.fairlabor.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a [[Workplace Code of Conduct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Codes of Conduct|url=http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/fla_complete_code_and_benchmarks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
based on ILO standards and addresses 1) forced labour; 2) child labour; 3) harassment or abuse; 4) nondiscrimination; 5) health and safety; 6) freedom of association and collective bargaining; 7) wages and benefits 8) hours of work and 9 overtime compensation.

===Transnational corporations===
Around half of the wealthiest 100 entities in the world today are corporations not countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 175 Economic Entities|url=http://dstevenwhite.com/2012/08/11/the-top-175-global-economic-entities-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many organisations committing gross human rights violations from which they earn vast profits. Wars are inflamed through arms sales and corporations deal in [[conflict commodities]] like diamonds.

Importantly the legal personality of corporations was established in the ''[[Barcelona Traction]]'' case. (1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barcellona Light and Traction Company Ltd Case|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/50/5387.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017165556/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/50/5387.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the UN Commission on Human Rights asked the OHCHR to compile a report on the responsibilities of [[transnational corporation]]s (TNCs) and following up on the report a Special Representative was appointed to look at the issues and to comment on the relationship of TNC's and other business enterprises. The Ruggie Reports from between 2005 -2011 present a conceptual and policy framework to help guide relevant actors comprising three core principles ''protect, respect and remedy''. It is the State duty to ''protect'' against human rights abuses by third parties, including business; whilst there is a corporate responsibility to ''respect'' human rights; and furthermore there is need for effective access to ''remedies.'' In 2011 The [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]] were annexed to the last report.

States have the primary role in preventing and addressing corporate related human rights abuses under resolution 8/7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 8/7|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_8_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  governments can support and strengthen market pressures on companies to respect rights whilst adequate reporting enables stakeholders to examine rights related performance. To fulfil the duty to protect states must regulate and adjudicate the acts of business enterprises. International Human rights treaties do not themselves create direct obligations for corporations but treaty bodies refer more directly to the role of states in specifically guarding against human rights violations by corporations. The more recent [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] clearly provides that state parties have an obligation to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person organization or private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on  the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and  Optional Protocol|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/convention/convoptprot-e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unresolved legal issue in this regard is as to the extent of a State's jurisdiction, does a states obligation extend extra-territorially or internationally?

Business enterprises should respect human rights, avoiding infringing on the human rights of others and they should address adverse human rights impacts when they are involved. The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights refers to those rights as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the [[International Labour Organization]] [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work|url=http://www.ilocarib.org.tt/cariblex/pdfs/ILO_Declaration_Work.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their duty to protect against business related human rights abuse States must take appropriate steps to ensure that those affected have access to effective remedy through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means.

Since the 1990s [[soft law]] instruments have been relied upon to guide corporate behaviour such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Global Compact and the UN draft norms on transnational corporation and other business enterprises. The OECD Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Guidelines for  Multinational Enterprises|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/mne/1922428.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover a wide range of issues including labour and environmental standards, human rights, corruption, consumer protection, technology amongst others. The guidelines are completely voluntary and were revised in 2000 and updated in 2011. In 2000 a complaint procedure was introduced allowing NGO's and others to submit complaints to alleged breaches where previously only trade unions could submit complaints. The 2011 update introduced a specific chapter on human rights and aligns the guidelines with the UN Special Rapporteur framework of "protect respect and remedy".

In 2000 the UN established the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Global Compact|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which call on business leaders "embrace and enact' a set of 10 principles relating to human rights, labour rights, environmental protections and corruption. The compact did not include a mechanism for dispute resolution. In response to this criticism integrity measures were introduced in 2005 which created a complaints procedure for systematic abuse of the compacts overall aims and principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McBeth et all|first=Adam|title=The International Law of Human Rights|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=615–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a UN subcommission on the promotion and protection of Human Rights adopted a set of international norms applying to TNC's and other business they are based on international instruments, non binding declarations and guidelines adopted by multilateral organizations. The norms include 1) general obligations; 2) rights to equal opportunity and non-discriminatory treatment; 3) rights to security of persons; 4) rights of workers 5) respect for national sovereignty and human rights; 6) obligations with regard to consumer protection; 7) obligations with regard to environmental protection 8) general provisions of implementation and 9) definitions. The norms however do not have legal status and are unlikely to be developed further and the subcomission is  now replaced by the [[Human Rights Council Advisory Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Council Advisory Committee|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/AdvisoryCommittee/Pages/AboutAC.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also emerged over the past decades a proliferation of company specific and multi-stakeholder codes of conduct such as the [[Sullivan principles]] and as such hundreds of companies have now publicly committed to upholding basic human rights. Codes of conduct are regarded as part of the soft law regime and are not legally binding but the general normative effect may lead to legal effect as standards may be incorporated into employment and agency contracts.

===Human rights enforcement===
The [[Human Rights Commission]] tasked with drawing up the UDHR was divided on whether the bill should be legally enforceable either as an annex to the UN Charter or as a multilateral convention. As a Declaration of principles it has no powers of implementation but results in new developments of customary international law. As a non legal document the declaration yet defines the nature and meaning of a pledge to respect human rights provided under  [[Article 55]] of the UN Charter. Since its initial singing with 48 members and 8 abstention it has grown to include 192 member states. As such Human rights have an inherent dignity and are inalienable, they "should be protected by the rule of law" to prevent the need of individuals being compelled to revolt against tyranny

During the 1970s, General Pinochet's crimes in Argentina contributed greatly to the general assembly passing the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]]1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration Against Torture|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Helsinki Accords]] 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helsinki Final Act 1975|url=http://www.osce.org/mc/39501?download=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; also gave strength to the Human Rights movement. Today the binding UN covenants of the [[ICCPR]] and the [[ICESCR]] are now in force. In 1977 the Security Council imposed mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa after having previously declared apartheid as "a grave threat to the peace" justifying the interference into the States internal affairs. The ban on trade was not policed and circumnavigated by multinational corporations. During this period [[Andrei Sakharov]] drew attention to the plight of political prisoners whilst critiquing the UN system for its partisan politics. [[Václav Havel]] appealed to the Helsinki promise of political cooperation to be taken at face value. These developments coincided with a shift in US foreign policy to include human rights in its agenda while the twin covenants making human rights abuse a legitimate subject of international concern.

The Commission and [[Human Rights Council]] have not substantially acted on human rights violations and states represented on the commission have not wished to create enforcement procedures which might be used on themselves or their allies, such that tragedies like Pol Pot's [[Genocide]] and the execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] persist. The [[Human Rights Committee]] a body of independent experts monitor the implementation of the [[ICCPR]]. All parties must submit an initial report and are subject to four yearly reporting. Concerns and recommendations are addressed in "concluding observations" addressed to the State Party. Article 41 provides for interstate complaints while the Optional Protocol 1 gives the committee competence to examine individual complaints of alleged violation by State Parties to the Protocol

Enforcement in relation to TNC's has often been through tort litigation where human rights standards have been incorporated into domestic legislation. though International law itself is yet unable to impose human rights obligations on corporations.  The [[Alien Tort Statute]] or Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) of 1789 draws directly on international norms to hold corporations liable for conduct that violates human rights. The ATCA allows a plaintiff not resident in the USA to sue a defendant over which a US court has jurisdiction for a violation of the [[law of nations]] even where the event is outside US territory. In ''Filartiga v Pane-Irala'' a Paraguayan policeman was sued for torture and murder of the plaintiffs relative though in ''Sosa v Alvarez Machain'' it was held That the ATCA did not extend to arbitrary arrest or detention in violation of the UDHR and the ICCPR.

In ''Doe v Unocal'' a civil claim was brought under the ATCA alleging abuses on the part of an oil consortium and its security representatives which resulted in forced labour, murder, rape and torture of villages. The Court held that a reasonable person could conclude on the evidence that Uncol had aided and abetted the abuses committed by the Myanmar Military and court drew on the jurisprudence of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McBeth et all|first=Adam|title=The International Law of Human Rights|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=626–628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Criminal Court|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821060843/http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=2015-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; may hold individuals accountable for human rights abuses under the provision of its founding statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not however have jurisdiction of corporations though individuals within corporations can be held to account. The Court has jurisdiction to try cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes where states with the domestic criminal jurisdiction are unwilling to carry out investigations. Where multinational corporations commit crimes on a scale that reach the level of the courts jurisdiction individuals responsible can then be held liable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">The '''innovation butterfly''' is a [[metaphor]] that describes how seemingly minor perturbations (disturbances or changes) to project plans in a system connecting markets, demand, product features, and a firm's capabilities can steer the project, or an entire portfolio of projects, down an irreversible path in terms of technology and market evolution.

==Origins==
The metaphor was developed by researchers Anderson and Joglekar.&lt;ref name="SysThkr"&gt;Anderson, E.G. Jr. and Joglekar, N.R. (2007). "Chasing the Innovation Butterfly with 'Systems Thinking'", ''The Systems Thinker'', 18(9): 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived as a specific instance of the more general '[[butterfly effect]]' encountered in [[chaos theory]].

==How it works==
The innovation butterfly arises because many innovation systems are made up of a large number of elements that interact with each other via several non-linear [[feedback loop]]s containing embedded delays, thus constituting a [[complex system]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, J.D. (1994). "Learning in and about Complex Systems", ''System Dynamics Review'', 10(2-3): 291-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbations can come from decisions made within the firm or from those made by its competitors, or they can result from external forces such as government legislation or environmental regulations, or unexpected spikes in the [[Price of petroleum|price of oil]]. How the innovation system evolves as a result of the innovation butterfly can lead ultimately to an innovative firm's success or failure.

Complex systems, in domains such as [[physics]], [[biology]], or [[sociology]], are known to be prone to both [[path dependence]] and [[emergent behavior]]. What makes the behavior of the innovation butterfly different is market selection, along with biases in individual and group decision making within distributed innovation settings, may influence the emergent behavior. Furthermore, managers in most fields of business endeavor to reduce uncertainty in order to better manage risk. In innovation settings, however, because success is based upon [[creativity]], managers must actively embrace [[uncertainty]]. This leads to a management conundrum because innovation managers and management systems must encourage the potential for a butterfly effect but then must also learn how to cope with its aftermath.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"&gt;Anderson and Joglekar (2007), pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G and Nitin R. Joglekar. (2012). The Innovation Butterfly: Managing Emergent Opportunities and Risks During Distributed Innovation. Springer (Understanding Complex Systems Series)"&lt;/ref&gt;

How innovation butterflies are 'chased' is highly managerially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G. and Nitin Joglekar (2005).  A Hierarchical Modeling Framework for Product Development Planning.  ''Production and Operations Management'', 14 (3): 344-361.&lt;/ref&gt; Most butterflies end up 'merely' consuming a considerable amount of time and resources within a project, or for an innovation portfolio, within a firm. However, some butterflies can also unleash [[Regime change|regime-altering]] emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment.&lt;ref&gt;Garud, R. and Karnøe, P. 2001 ‘Path Creation as a Process of Mindful Deviation’. In Path Dependence and Creation, R. Garud and P. Karnøe (eds.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, once these emergent outcomes begin to mature, and in some instances lead to [[disruptive innovation]]s, they become extremely difficult to manage,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. (1997). The Innovator's Dilemma : When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Harvard Business Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, shaping the innovation system before potential innovation butterfly's effects completely emerge is critical.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"/&gt;

This four-[[kanji|character]] compound (or [[yojijukugo]]) literally translates as "what the mind thinks, the heart transmits".  Sometimes translated into English as "[[telepathy]]" or "[[sympathy]]", ''ishin-denshin'' is also commonly rendered as "[[Heart (symbolism)|heart]]-to-heart communication" or "[[Tacit knowledge|tacit understanding]]".&lt;ref name="Cheung1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheung|first=King-Kok|title=Articulate Silences: Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0DrUokTlmgC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8147-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although silent understanding is generally recognized as a universal human phenomenon, the term ''ishin-denshin'' is often used to convey a style of [[nonverbal communication]] between two people that is felt by some Japanese to be characteristic of [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Roger J. |last2=Ikeno|first2=Osamu|title=The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TW7lHYwXhS4C&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=July 28, 2012|date=March 15, 2002|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-3295-3|pages=52–54, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The Anatomy of Self,1985,page138(...telepathic,pre-linguistic,...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W.Dower,War without Mercy,1986,page107(...nondiscursive communication...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel van Wolferen,The Enigma of Japanese Power,1989,page327(...supra-conversational...)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Japanese concept of ''[[haragei]]'' denotes a deliberate form of nonverbal communication, ''ishin-denshin'' refers to a passive form of shared understanding.  ''Ishin-denshin'' is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as sincere, silent communication via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, ''[[Uchi-soto|uchi]]''), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, ''soto''), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities.&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt; The introduction of this concept to Japan (via China) is related to the traditions of [[Zen Buddhism]], where the term ''ishin-denshin'' refers to direct [[Dharma transmission|mind transmission]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|last= Baroni|first=Helen Josephine |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=July 28, 2012|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zen Buddhism]] tradition, in turn, draws the concept of ''ishin-denshin'' from the first [[Dharma transmission]] between [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahākāśyapa]] in the [[Flower Sermon]].&lt;ref name="Shores1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/JeffShore.pdf |title=THE SOURCE OF ZEN: WHO TRANSMITS WHAT? |last1=Shore |first1=Jeff |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durix1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durix |first=Claude |date=1991 |title=Cent Clés pour Comprendre le Zen |publisher=Le Courrier du Livre |page=43 |isbn=2-7029-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7698">{{IAST|'''''Jagadguru'''''}} ([[Sanskrit]]: जगदगुरु), literally meaning the {{IAST|''[[Guru]]''}} of the universe, is a title used in {{IAST|[[Sanatana Dharma|''Sanātana Dharma'']]}}. Traditionally, it has been bestowed upon or used for {{IAST|[[acharya|''Ācāryas'']]}} belonging to the {{IAST|[[Vedanta|''Vedānta'']]}} school (among the [[Sad Darsana|six traditional schools]] of thought in [[Hinduism]]) who have written [[Sanskrit]] commentaries on the {{IAST|[[Prasthanatrayi|''Prasthānatrayī'']]}} (literally, 'the three sources') - the {{IAST|[[Brahma Sutra|''Brahma sūtras'']]}} (the original scripture of {{IAST|[[Vedanta|''Vedānta'']]}}), the {{IAST|[[Bhagavad Gita|''Bhagavad-gītā'']]}} (part of the {{IAST|[[Mahabharata|''Mahābhārata'']]}}) and the principal {{IAST|[[Upanishad|''Upaniṣads'']]}}. Historically, ''Jagadguru''s have established a lineage ({{IAST|[[Parampara|''Paramparā'']]}}), established an institution to spread ''[[Dharma]]'', who have been based in [[Varanasi]], famous for being the centre of [[Sanskrit]] study and the "Capital of All Knowledge".

==Origin and history of the term==
{{IAST|''Jagadguru''}} is of [[Sanskrit]] origin where जगत्  (''jagat'') means 'the entire world' and गुरु (''guru'') means 'spiritual master' (literally, 'dispeller of darkness'). In the classics and scriptures, the word has been used for several [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. In the {{IAST|[[Mahabharata|''Mahābhārata'']]}}, [[Arjuna]] addresses {{IAST|Śrī [[Krishna|Kṛṣṇa]]}} as the 'Supreme Master of the entire world'. {{IAST|[[Adi Shankaracharya|Ādi Jagadguru Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya]]}} uses the title {{IAST|''Jagadguru''}} for {{IAST|Śrī [[Krishna|Kṛṣṇa]]}} in his {{IAST|''Śrī Kṛṣṇa-āṣṭakam''}}. &lt;ref name="ashtakam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shankaracharya|first1=Adi|author-link=Adi_Shankara|title=Shri Krishna-ashtakam|url=http://kksongs.org/songs/v/vasudevasutamdevam.html|website=Krsna Kirtana Songs|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit poet {{IAST|[[Kalidas|Kālidāsa]]}} uses the word {{IAST|''Jagadguru''}} for {{IAST|[[Shiva|Lord Śiva]]}} in his great poem ({{IAST|[[Kāvya|''Mahā-kāvya'']]}}) titled {{IAST|''[[Kumārasambhava]]''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|''[[Kumārasambhava]]''}}, Canto 6, Verse 15 and also Canto 8, verse 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{IAST|[[Ramcharitmanas|''Rāmacaritamānasa'']]}}, the poet-saint {{IAST|[[Tulasidas|Tulasidāsa]]}} uses the same word for {{IAST|[[Rama|Lord Rāma]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|''[[Rāmacaritamānasa]]''}}, {{IAST|''Āraṇya Kāṇḍa''}}, verse 3.9.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IAST|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati|His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda]]}} uses it for {{IAST|[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu]]}} in his song {{IAST|''Guru Paramparā''}}. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarasvati|first1=Bhaktisiddhanta|title=Guru Parampara|author-link=Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati|url=http://kksongs.org/songs/k/krsnahoitecatur.html|website=Krsna Kirtana Songs|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IAST|[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|His Divine Grace A. C.

[[File:Loesje ukraine.jpg|thumb|UKRAINE&lt;br&gt;WHEN DEMOCRACY ISN'T WORKING&lt;br&gt;PEOPLE ARE]]

'''Loesje''' ({{IPAc-en|'|l|uː|ʃ|ə}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈluʃə|lang}}) is an international [[free speech]] [[organisation]] started in [[Arnhem]] ([[Netherlands]]) in 1983 and went international in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/page/3661  This is Loesje]&lt;/ref&gt; Its charter is to spread creativity, positive criticism, ideas, philosophical ponderings and thoughts on current events by way of short slogans on [[poster]]s. The posters are signed by Loesje, which is a Dutch female name, representing "a world wide collective of people who want to make the world a more positive creative place".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/page/3661  This is Loesje]&lt;/ref&gt;

Loesje is currently to some extent active in over 30 countries, including [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]],  [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Nigeria]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States|United States of America]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. In one country it is possible to have several more or less active writing groups.

It is not clear how many active writers there are and also the number of people who decide to spread the posters that can be downloaded from the poster archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/posterarchive/advanced  Poster archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation cannot hold track of who spreads posters and where, partly because it is impossible to see how often a poster is downloaded (or printed at home)  from the website, and partly because Loesje is not responsible for any misdeeds of individuals who paste posters on places where it is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/node/3456  Sticking law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2013, Loesje's international headquarters were located in [[Berlin]], but since then Loesje International has moved back to Arnhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/contact  Address of Loesje International]&lt;/ref&gt; From there Loesje implements and coordinates many diverse international projects around the world. Loesje gives creative writing [http://www.loesje.org/page/3671  workshops], for team building for example and joins conferences about issues that connect to her values, such as this environmental conference called [http://www.loesje.org/CEI2012  Caretakers of the environment international] in 2012 in [[Maastricht]] in the Netherlands. Loesje is especially active on [[World Press Freedom Day]].

The '''Looting of the Eastern Mausoleum''' was an incident in which some of the major [[mausoleum]]s of the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] in the [[Eastern Qing Tombs]] were looted by troops under the command of the warlord [[Sun Dianying]].

==Prelude==
In the early hours of June 8, 1928, warlord [[Sun Dianying]] led his army into the Eastern Mausoleums of the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[Malanyu]], northwest of [[Zunhua]], [[Hebei]]. This was the final resting place of the Qing emperors and empresses, and was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the [[Forbidden City]] of Peking. The 78-square-kilometer (30.1-square-mile) burial site was for five emperors, 15 empresses and 136 imperial [[concubine]]s within 15 tombs, including the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] (1638–61), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1654–1722), the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–99) and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (1835–1908).

==Looting operation==
On June 12, 1928, Sun Dianying ordered a large-scale graverobbing operation that removed almost all the underground funeral objects of the Huifeiling and Yuling Mausoleums and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling. Ma Futian, Regimental Commander in the 28th Army of [[Zhang Zuolin]], had quietly occupied Malanyu. Sun Dianying ordered [[Tan Wenjiang]], one of his division commanders, to capture the tomb area. At dawn on July 2, Ma Futian was driven away and Tan's army looted the mausoleums in Malanyu. After that, Sun's army went straight to the area of the Eastern Qing Tombs, pretending to engage in war exercises in the area. Tan Wenjiang placed policemen all around, denying access to the area and signs declared the army was "protecting the Tombs" to prevent interference.&lt;ref name="qing east"&gt;The Qing East Imperial Tombs http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/atam/115430.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[looting]] operation was directed by Sun Dianying from his car. Trucks were on hand to speed away with the loot as soon as they were loaded. At midnight the engineering corps blew up the entrance, opening the passage leading to the underground palace. The stone door was pried open to give access to the rear room of the grave. Sun gave first priority to officers above battalion commander level to collect treasure for themselves. Ordinary soldiers were eventually allowed to take the leftovers.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

The robbers first took the large treasure objects placed around the remains of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], such as [[jadeite]] watermelons, grasshoppers and vegetables, jade lotus and coral. They snatched objects found beneath the body and ravaged the corpse itself, taking her imperial robe; tearing off her undergarments, shoes and socks, and taking all the pearls and jewels on her body. The looters even pried open her jaws and took the rare pearl from her mouth. Ultimately, they looted the objects under the coffin that had been favorites of Cixi when she was alive.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

While Tan Wenjiang was robbing Cixi's tomb, Han Dabao, a brigade commander under Sun Dianying, led another group to the Yuling Mausoleum and declared his intention to conduct a war exercise. They blew the entrance and doorways of the underground palace and rushed into the tomb. The coffins of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] and his two empresses and three concubines were pried open, all the valuables looted and the skeletons thrown into the mud. The soldiers then rushed to the Yuling Mausoleum and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling and looted what they could.

Newspapers reported the graverobbing and the news spread throughout China and around the world. People were outraged. China's dethroned last emperor [[Puyi]], who had dismissed Sun from his post, sent telegrams to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[Yan Xishan]], Commander of Garrison Force in Beijing; the Central Committee of [[Kuomintang]] and local newspapers asking them to punish Sun Dianying severely. Many others also called for punishment. However, Sun Dianying bribed those who were in a position to discipline him and nothing was done.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

After removing the treasures from the graves, Sun and his army sealed the empty chambers with stones. They carted off some of China's greatest treasures, but some things could not be easily removed and the imposing buildings of the mausoleum still survive.&lt;ref name="Qing"&gt;Qing Tombs Tell Tales http://www.china-sd.net/eng/sdnews/listnews.asp?classid=159&amp;siteid=2483&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnetoreception''' (also '''magnetoception''') is a [[sense]] which allows an [[organism]] to detect a [[magnetic field]] to perceive direction, altitude or location. This sensory modality is used by a range of animals for orientation and [[animal navigation|navigation]],&lt;ref name="Wiltschko" /&gt; and as a method for animals to develop regional maps. For the purpose of navigation, magnetoreception deals with the detection of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

Magnetoreception is present in [[bacteria]], [[arthropod]]s, [[mollusc]]s and members of all major taxonomic groups of [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="Wiltschko"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 8 - Magnetoreception|author1=Wiltschko, F.R.  |author2=Wiltschko, W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sensing in Nature|volume=739  |editor=Carlos López-Larrea|year=2012|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1704-0|publisher=Springer|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology  |isbn=978-1-4614-1703-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not thought to have a magnetic sense, but there is a [[protein]] (a [[cryptochrome]]) in the eye which could serve this function.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Lauren E.|last2=Gegear|first2=Robert J.|last3=Reppert|first3=Steven M.|title=Human cryptochrome exhibits light-dependent magnetosensitivity|journal=Nature Communications|date=2011|volume=2|issue=Article 356|doi=10.1038/ncomms1364|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v2/n6/full/ncomms1364.html|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.356F|pmid=21694704|pmc=3128388|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms==
An unequivocal demonstration of the use of magnetic fields for orientation within an [[organism]] has been in a class of bacteria known as [[magnetotactic bacteria]].  These bacteria demonstrate a behavioural phenomenon known as [[magnetotaxis]], in which the bacterium orients itself and migrates in the direction along the Earth's magnetic field lines.  The bacteria contain [[magnetosome]]s, which are nanometer-sized particles of magnetite or iron sulfide enclosed within the bacterial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = R. | year = 1975 | title = Magnetotactic Bacteria | url = | journal = Science | volume = 190 | issue = 4212| pages = 377–379 | doi = 10.1126/science.170679 | pmid = 170679 |bibcode = 1975Sci...190..377B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetosomes are surrounded by a membrane composed of phospholipids and fatty acids and contain at least 20 different proteins &lt;ref&gt;The Magneto-Lab. "Biochemistry and molecular biology of magnetosome formation in ''Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense''." Available: http://magnum.mpi-bremen.de/magneto/research/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  They form in chains where the [[magnetic moment]]s of each magnetosome align in parallel, causing each bacterium cell to essentially act as a [[magnetic dipole]], giving the bacteria their permanent-magnet characteristics.

For animals the mechanism for magnetoreception is unknown, but there exist two main hypotheses to explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Wiltschkojcp&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2000, [[cryptochrome]] was proposed as the "magnetic molecule", so to speak, that could harbor magnetically sensitive radical-pairs. Cryptochrome, a [[flavoprotein]] found in the eyes of [[European robin]]s and other animal species, is the only protein known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in animals.&lt;ref name=Hore2016 /&gt;  The function of cryptochrome is diverse across species, however, the photoinduction of radical-pairs occurs by exposure to blue light, which excites an electron in a [[chromophore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=Roswitha|last2=Ahmad|first2=Margaret|last3=Nießner|first3=Christine|last4=Gehring|first4=Dennis|last5=Wiltschko|first5=Wolfgang|date=2016-05-01|title=Light-dependent magnetoreception in birds: the crucial step occurs in the dark|journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface|volume=13|issue=118|doi=10.1098/rsif.2015.1010|issn=1742-5662|pmc=4892254|pmid=27146685|pages=20151010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth's magnetic field is only 0.5 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] and so it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism, other than phase shift, by which such a field could lead to any chemical changes other than those affecting the weak magnetic fields between radical pairs.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C.

The second proposed model for magnetoreception relies on Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, also referred to as  iron (II, III) oxide or [[magnetite]], a natural oxide with strong magnetism. Iron (II, III) oxide remains permanently magnetized when its length is larger than 50&amp;nbsp;nm and becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field if its length is less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cadiou | first1 = Hervé | last2 = McNaughton | first2 = Peter A | year = 2010 | title = Avian magnetite-based magnetoreception: a physiologist's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface | volume = 7 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = S193–205 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2009.0423.focus | pmid = 20106875 | pmc = 2844004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these situations the Earth's magnetic field leads to a transducible signal via a physical effect on this magnetically sensitive oxide.

Another less general type of magnetic sensing mechanism in animals that has been described is electromagnetic induction used by sharks, stingrays and [[chimaera]]s ([[cartilaginous fish]]).  These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{ind}=-\frac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
These organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa. These receptors are located along the mouth and nose of sharks and stingrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blonder|first=Barbara I.|last2=Alevizon|first2=William S.|date=1988|title=Prey Discrimination and Electroreception in the Stingray Dasyatis sabina|journal=Copeia|volume=1988|issue=1|pages=33–36|doi=10.2307/1445919|jstor=1445919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalmijn|first=A.

==In invertebrates and fish==

The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' was proposed to orient to the magnetic field of the Earth using the first described set of magnetosensory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidal-Gadea| first1 = A.G. | last2 = Ward | first2 = K. | last3 = Beron | first3 = C. |last4 = Ghorashian | first4 = N. | last5 = Gokce| first5 = S. |last6 = Russell | first6 = J. | last7 = Truong| first7 = N. | last8 = Parikh | first8 = A. | last9 = Gadea| first9 = G. |last10 = Ben-Yakar| first10 = A. | last11 = Pierce-Shimomura| first11 = J. |year = 2015 | title = Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans. | journal = eLife | doi =  10.7554/eLife.07493 | pmid = 26083711 | volume=4 | pmc=4525075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worms appear to use the magnetic field to orient during vertical soil migrations that change in sign depending on their satiation state (with hungry worms burrowing down, and satiated worms burrowing up). However, recent evidence challenges these findings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Nimpf|first2=Simon|last3=Hochstoeger|first3=Tobias|last4=Nordmann|first4=Gregory C|last5=Papadaki-Anastasopoulou|first5=Artemis|last6=Keays|first6=David A|date=2018-04-13|title=Comment on "Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans"|url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/30187|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=7|doi=10.7554/elife.30187|issn=2050-084X|pmc=5898909|pmid=29651983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Nordmann|first2=Gregory|last3=Nimpf|first3=Simon|last4=Hochstoeger|first4=Tobias|last5=Kagerbauer|first5=Daniel|last6=Keays|first6=David|date=2018-06-18|title=Revised testing procedures do not elicit magnetoreceptive behavior in C. elegans|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/18/349944|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=349944|doi=10.1101/349944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mollusk ''[[Tochuina tetraquetra]]'' (formerly ''Tritonia diomedea'' or ''Tritonia gigantea'') has been studied for clues as to the neural mechanism behind magnetoreception in a species. Some of the earliest work with ''Tochuina'' showed that prior to a full moon ''Tochuina'' would orient their bodies between magnetic north and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lohmann | first1 = K.

D. | year = 1987 | title = Lunar-Modulated Geomagnetic Orientation by a Marine Mollusk | url = | journal = Science | volume = 235 | issue = 4786| pages = 331–334 | doi = 10.1126/science.3798115 | pmid = 3798115 |bibcode = 1987Sci...235..331L }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Y-maze was established with a right turn equal to geomagnetic south and a left turn equal to geomagnetic east. Within this geomagnetic field 80% of ''Tochuina'' made a turn to the left or magnetic east. However, when a reversed magnetic field was applied that rotated magnetic north 180° there was no significant preference for either turn, which now corresponded with magnetic north and magnetic west. These results, though interesting, do not conclusively establish that ''Tochuina'' uses magnetic fields in magnetoreception. These experiments do not include a control for the activation of the Rubens’ coil in the reversed magnetic field experiments. Therefore, it is possible that heat or noise generated by the coil was responsible for the loss of choice preference.  Further work with ''Tochuina'' was unable to identify any neurons that showed rapid changes in firing as a result of magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lohmann | first1 = K.

Further studies showed that pedal 7 neurons in the pedal ganglion were inhibited when exposed to magnetic fields over the course of 30 minutes. The function of both pedal 5 neurons and pedal 7 neurons is currently unknown.

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|Fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'' needs cryptochrome to respond to magnetic fields.]]

''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is another invertebrate which may be able to orient to magnetic fields. Experimental techniques such as gene knockouts have allowed a closer examination of possible magnetoreception in these fruit flies. Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="Gegear2008" /&gt; In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a missense mutation or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&amp;nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&amp;nbsp;nm – 400&amp;nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

Alteration of the tryptophan protein does not result in the loss of magnetosensitivity of a fly expressing either type 1 Cry or the cryptochrome found in vertebrates, type 2 Cry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gegear | first1 = R.

These experiments used a 5 gauss magnetic field, 10 times the strength of the [[Earth's magnetic field]]). ''Drosophila'' has not been shown to be able to respond to the Earth’s weaker magnetic field.

Studies of magnetoreception in vertebrate fish have been conducted mainly with salmon. For instance, the presence of an internal magnetic compass has been discovered in [[Sockeye salmon|Sockeye Salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus nerka'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Thomas P.|date=1980|title=Evidence for celestial and magnetic compass orientation in lake migrating sockeye salmon fry|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00657119|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology ? A|volume=137|issue=3|pages=243–248|doi=10.1007/bf00657119|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers made this discovery by first placing the young of this species in a symmetrical, circular tank and allowing them to pass through exits in the tank freely. A mean vector was then calculated to represent the directional preferences of these salmon in the natural magnetic field. Notably, when the magnetic field was experimentally rotated, the directional preferences of the young Sockeye Salmon changed accordingly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, researchers concluded that the orientation of swimming behaviour in Sockeye Salmon is influenced by magnetic field information.

Further research regarding magnetoreception in salmon has investigated [[Chinook salmon|Chinook Salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tschawytscha).'' To induce a preference for magnetic East-West, a group of these salmon were housed in a rectangular tank with water flowing from west to east for eighteen months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=P. B.|date=1986-05|title=Experimental evidence for geomagnetic orientation in juvenile salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha Walbaum|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05196.x|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=607–623|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05196.x|issn=0022-1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was also fed exclusively at the west end of the tank during this period. Upon placing these same salmon in a circular tank with symmetrical water flow, a preference for aligning their bodies with magnetic East-West was observed as expected. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90°, the salmon changed their preferred orientation to the North-South axis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From these results, researchers concluded that Chinook Salmon have the capacity to use magnetic field information in directional orientation.

Magnetoreception is well documented in [[honey bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s.&lt;ref name="PB"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pereira-Bomfim, M.D.G.C., Antonialli-Junior, W.F. and Acosta-Avalos, D.|year=2015|title=Effect of magnetic field on the foraging rhythm and behavior of the swarm-founding paper wasp Polybia paulista Ihering (hymenoptera: vespidae)|journal=Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=99–104|doi=10.13102/sociobiology.v62i1.99-104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ants and bees, this is used to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and within their migratory paths.&lt;ref name="Wajnberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author="Wajnberg, E., Acosta-Avalos, D., Alves, O.C., de Oliveira, J.F., Srygley, R.B. and Esquivel, D.M.|year=2010|title=Magnetoreception in eusocial insects: an update|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=7|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S207–S225|doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0526.focus|pmid=20106876|pmc=2843992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, through the use of magnetoreception, the Brazilian stingless bee ''[[Schwarziana quadripunctata]]'' is able to distinguish differences in altitude, location, and directionality using the thousands of hair-like particles on its antennae.&lt;ref name=nunes09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=T.M.|last2=Turatti|first2=I.C.C.|last3=Mateus|first3=S.|last4=Nascimento|first4=F.S.|last5=Lopes|first5=N.P.|last6=Zucchi|first6=R.|year=2009|title=Cuticular Hydrocarbons in the Stingless Bee Schwarziana quadripunctata (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini): Differences between Colonies, Castes and Age |journal=Genetics and Molecular Research |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=589–595 |url=http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2009/vol8-2/pdf/kerr012.pdf |doi=10.4238/vol8-2kerr012 |pmid=19551647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetoreception has also been reported in the [[European eel]] by at least one study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/13/523450769/eels-may-use-magnetic-maps-as-they-slither-across-the-ocean Eels May Use 'Magnetic Maps' As They Slither Across The Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In amphibians and reptiles ==
A number of [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and [[Reptile|reptiles]] including [[Salamander|salamanders]], [[Toad|toads]] and [[Turtle|turtles]] exhibit alignment behaviours with respect to the Earth's magnetic field.

Some of the earliest studies of amphibian magnetoreception were conducted with [[Cave salamander|cave salamanders]] (''Eurycea lucifuga)''. Researchers housed groups of cave salamanders in corridors aligned with either magnetic North-South, or magnetic East-West. In ensuing tests, the magnetic field was experimentally rotated by 90°, and salamanders were placed in cross-shaped structures (one corridor along the new North-South axis, one along the new East-West axis).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John B.|date=1977|title=Use of the earth's magnetic field by orienting cave salamanders (Eurycea lucifuga)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00609616|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology ? A|volume=121|issue=2|pages=273–288|doi=10.1007/bf00609616|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these salamanders showed a significant preference for test corridors which matched the magnetic alignment of their housing corridors, researchers concluded that cave salamanders have the capacity to detect the Earth’s magnetic field, and have a preference for movement along learned magnetic axes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Subsequent research has examined magnetoreception in a more natural setting. Under typical circumstances, [[Eastern newt|red-spotted newts]] (''Notophthalmus viridescens)'' respond to drastic increases in water temperature (which tend to indicate environmental deterioration) by orienting themselves toward the shoreline and heading for land.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John B.|date=1986|title=Magnetic compass orientation in the Eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00614524|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=158|issue=1|pages=103–109|doi=10.1007/bf00614524|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when magnetic fields are experimentally altered, this behaviour is disrupted, and assumed orientations fail to direct the newts to the shoreline.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Moreover, the change in orientation corresponds to the degree by which the magnetic field is shifted.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In other words, inversion of the magnetic poles (a 180° shift) results in inversion of the typical orientation (a 180° shift). Further research has shown that magnetic information is not only used by red-spotted newts for orientation toward the shoreline, but also in orientation toward their home pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|date=1986-08-15|title=Two magnetoreception pathways in a migratory salamander|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.3738508|journal=Science|volume=233|issue=4765|pages=765–767|doi=10.1126/science.3738508|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it seems as though red-spotted newts rely on information regarding the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation within their environment, in particular when orienting toward the shoreline or toward home.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In similar fashion, [[Common toad|European]] (''Bufo bufo'') and [[Natterjack toad|Natterjack]] (''Epidalea calamita)'' toads appear to rely, at least somewhat, on magnetic information for certain orienting behaviours. These species of anurans are known to rely on vision and olfaction when locating and migrating to breeding sites, but it seems magnetic fields may also play a role. When randomly displaced from their breeding sites, these toads remain well-oriented, and are capable of navigating their way back, even when displaced by more than 150 meters.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1987|title=Orientation behaviour of toads (Bufo bufo) displaced from the breeding site|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00605013|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=161|issue=5|pages=715–727|doi=10.1007/bf00605013|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when this displacement is accompanied by the experimental attachment of small magnetic bars, toads fail to relocate breeding sites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1992-01|title=Sex-biassed site fidelity and orientation behaviour in reproductive natterjack toads (Bufo calamita)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927014.1992.9525347|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=4|issue=1|pages=15–32|doi=10.1080/08927014.1992.9525347|issn=0394-9370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering experimental attachment of non-magnetized bars of equal size and weight does not affect relocation, it seems that magnetism is responsible for the observed disorientation of these toads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, researchers have concluded that orientation toward breeding sites in these anurans is influenced by magnetic field information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinsch|first=Ulrich|date=1987|title=Orientation behaviour of toads (Bufo bufo) displaced from the breeding site|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00605013|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=161|issue=5|pages=715–727|doi=10.1007/bf00605013|issn=0340-7594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of study on magnetoreception in reptiles involves turtles. Some of the earliest support for magnetoreception in turtles was found in ''Terrapene carolina'', a species of [[box turtle]]. After successfully teaching a group of these box turtles to swim to either the east or west end of an experimental tank, the introduction of a strong magnet into the tank was enough to disrupt the learned routes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathis|first=Alicia|last2=Moore|first2=Frank R.|date=2010-04-26|title=Geomagnetism and the Homeward Orientation of the Box Turtle, Terrapene Carolina|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1988.tb00238.x|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=78|issue=4|pages=265–274|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1988.tb00238.x|issn=0179-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the learning of oriented paths seems to rely on some internal magnetic compass possessed by box turtles. Subsequent discovery of [[magnetite]] in the dura mater of Sea Turtle hatchlings supported this conclusion, as magnetite provides a means by which magnetic fields may be perceived.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/958527742|title=Magnetite Biomineralization and Magnetoreception in Organisms : a New Biomagnetism.|last=G.|first=Stehli, F.|date=1996|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461303138|oclc=958527742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, orientation toward the sea, a behaviour commonly seen in hatchlings of a number of turtle species, may rely, in part, on magnetoreception.  In [[Loggerhead sea turtle|Loggerhead]] and [[Leatherback sea turtle|Leatherback]] turtles, breeding takes place on beaches, and, after hatching, offspring crawl rapidly to the sea. Although differences in light density seem to drive this behaviour, magnetic alignment may also play a part. For instance, the natural directional preferences held by these hatchlings (which lead them from beaches to the sea) reverse upon experimental inversion of the magnetic poles, suggesting the Earth’s magnetic field serves as a reference for proper orientation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrill|first=Maria W.|last2=Salmon|first2=Michael|date=2010-09-30|title=Magnetic orientation by hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from the Gulf of Mexico|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1545-y|journal=Marine Biology|volume=158|issue=1|pages=101–112|doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1545-y|issn=0025-3162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In homing pigeons==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] pigeons can use magnetic fields as part of their complex [[Animal navigation|navigation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions | url = | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1| pages = 21–7 | pmid = 9317262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tinsley Keeton|William Keeton]] showed that time-shifted homing pigeons are unable to orient themselves correctly on a clear, sunny day which is attributed to time-shifted pigeons being unable to compensate accurately for the movement of the sun during the day. Conversely, time-shifted pigeons released on overcast days navigate correctly. This led to the hypothesis that under particular conditions, homing pigeons rely on magnetic fields to orient themselves. Further experiments with magnets attached to the backs of homing pigeons demonstrated that disruption of the bird's ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field leads to a loss of proper orientation behavior under overcast conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W.

In a choice test birds were trained to jump onto a platform on one end of a tunnel if there was no magnetic field present and to jump onto a platform on the other end of the tunnel if a magnetic field was present. In this test, birds were rewarded with a food prize and punished with a time penalty. Homing pigeons were able to make the correct choice 55%-65% of the time which is higher than what would be expected if the pigeons were simply guessing. 

For a long time the [[Trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] system was the suggested location for a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor in the pigeon. This was based on two findings: First, magnetite-containing cells were reported in specific locations in the upper beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleissner|first=Gerta|last2=Holtkamp-Rötzler|first2=Elke|last3=Hanzlik|first3=Marianne|last4=Winklhofer|first4=Michael|last5=Fleissner|first5=Günther|last6=Petersen|first6=Nikolai|last7=Wiltschko|first7=Wolfgang|date=2003-02-26|title=Ultrastructural analysis of a putative magnetoreceptor in the beak of homing pigeons|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology|language=en|volume=458|issue=4|pages=350–360|doi=10.1002/cne.10579|pmid=12619070|issn=0021-9967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies, however, revealed that these cells were macrophages, not magnetosensitive neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treiber|first=Christoph Daniel|last2=Salzer|first2=Marion Claudia|last3=Riegler|first3=Johannes|last4=Edelman|first4=Nathaniel|last5=Sugar|first5=Cristina|last6=Breuss|first6=Martin|last7=Pichler|first7=Paul|last8=Cadiou|first8=Herve|last9=Saunders|first9=Martin|date=2012-04-11|title=Clusters of iron-rich cells in the upper beak of pigeons are macrophages not magnetosensitive neurons|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature11046|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=484|issue=7394|pages=367–70|doi=10.1038/nature11046|pmid=22495303|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Svenja|last2=Treiber|first2=Christoph Daniel|last3=Salzer|first3=Marion Claudia|last4=Michalik|first4=Andreas|last5=Ushakova|first5=Lyubov|last6=Keays|first6=David Anthony|last7=Mouritsen|first7=Henrik|last8=Heyers|first8=Dominik|date=2018-08-01|title=Lidocaine is a nocebo treatment for trigeminally mediated magnetic orientation in birds|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/145/20180124|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=15|issue=145|pages=20180124|doi=10.1098/rsif.2018.0124|issn=1742-5689|pmc=6127160|pmid=30089685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, pigeon magnetic field detection is impaired by sectioning the trigeminal nerve and by application of [[lidocaine]], an anesthetic, to the olfactory mucosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=Roswitha|last2=Schiffner|first2=Ingo|last3=Fuhrmann|first3=Patrick|last4=Wiltschko|first4=Wolfgang|date=September 2010|title=The Role of the Magnetite-Based Receptors in the Beak in Pigeon Homing|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982210008626|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=17|pages=1534–1538|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.073|pmid=20691593|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lidocaine treatment might lead to unspecific effects and not represent a direct interference with potential magnetoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Svenja|last2=Treiber|first2=Christoph Daniel|last3=Salzer|first3=Marion Claudia|last4=Michalik|first4=Andreas|last5=Ushakova|first5=Lyubov|last6=Keays|first6=David Anthony|last7=Mouritsen|first7=Henrik|last8=Heyers|first8=Dominik|date=2018-08-01|title=Lidocaine is a nocebo treatment for trigeminally mediated magnetic orientation in birds|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/145/20180124|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=15|issue=145|pages=20180124|doi=10.1098/rsif.2018.0124|issn=1742-5689|pmc=6127160|pmid=30089685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, an involvment of the trigeminal system is still debated.

Taken together the receptor responsible for magnetosensitivity in homing pigeons remains uncertain.

Aside from the sensory receptor for magnetic reception in homing pigeons there has been work on neural regions that are possibly involved in the processing of magnetic information within the brain. Areas of the brain that have shown increases in activity in response to magnetic fields with a strength of 50 or 150 microtesla are the posterior [[vestibular nuclei]], [[dorsal thalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[Avian pallium|visual hyperpallium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = L.-Q. | last2 = Dickman | first2 = J.

Work with [[mouse|mice]], [[mole-rat (disambiguation)|mole-rat]]s and [[bat]]s has shown that some mammals are capable of magnetoreception. When [[wood mouse|woodmice]] are removed from their home area and deprived of visual and olfactory cues, they orient themselves towards their homes until an inverted magnetic field is applied to their cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mather | first1 = J.G. | last2 = Baker | first2 = R.

This indicates that when woodmice are displaced, they use magnetic fields to orient themselves if there are no other cues available. However, early studies of these subjects were criticized because of the difficulty of completely removing sensory cues, and in some because the tests were performed out of the natural environment. In others, the results of these experiments do not conclusively show a response to magnetic fields when deprived of other cues, because the magnetic field was artificially changed before the test rather than during it.&lt;ref name="Marhold Wiltschko Burda"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A magnetic polarity compass for direction finding in a subterranean mammal |last1=Marhold|first1=S. |last2=Wiltschko|first2=W. |last3=Burda|first3=H. |year=1997 |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=421–423 |doi=10.1007/s001140050422 |bibcode=1997NW.....84..421M |pp=&lt;!--This source is for both of the previous sentences.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research, accounting for those factors, has led to a conclusion that the [[Zambian mole-rat]], a subterranean mammal, uses magnetic fields as a polarity compass to aid in the orientation of their nests.&lt;ref name="Marhold Wiltschko Burda" /&gt; In contrast to work with woodmice, Zambian mole-rats do not exhibit different orientation behavior when a visual cue such as the sun is present, a result that has been suggested is due to their subterranean lifestyle. Further investigation of mole-rat magnetoreception lead to the finding that exposure to magnetic fields leads to an increase in neural activity within the [[superior colliculus]] as measured by immediate early gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nemec | first1 = P. | last2 = Altmann | first2 = J. | last3 = Marhold | first3 = S. | last4 = Burda | first4 = H. | last5 = Oelschlager | first5 = H.

However, within the inner sublayer of the intermediate gray layer (InGi) there were two or three clusters of responsive cells. The more time the mole rats were exposed to a magnetic field the greater the immediate early gene expression within the InGi. However, if Zambian mole-rats were placed in a field with a shielded magnetic field only a few scattered cells were active. Therefore, it has been proposed that in mammals, the superior colliculus is an important neural structure in the processing of magnetic information.

Bats may also use magnetic fields to orient themselves. While it is known that bats use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to navigate over short distances, it is unclear how they navigate over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Thorup | first2 = K. | last3 = Vonhof | first3 = M.J. | last4 = Cochran | first4 = W.W. | last5 = Wikelski | first5 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Bat orientation using Earth's magnetic field | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7120| page = 702 | doi = 10.1038/444702a | pmid = 17151656 |bibcode = 2006Natur.444..702H }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Eptesicus fuscus]]'' are taken from their home roosts and exposed to magnetic fields 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise of magnetic north, they are disoriented and set off for their homes in the wrong direction. Therefore, it seems that ''Eptesicus fuscus'' is capable of magnetoreception. However, the exact use of magnetic fields by ''Eptesicus fuscus'' is unclear as the magnetic field could be used either as a map, a compass, or a compass calibrator. Recent research with another bat species, ''[[Myotis myotis]]'', supports the hypothesis that bats use magnetic fields as a compass calibrator and their primary compass is the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = W. | year = 2006 | title = Magnetoreception | url = | journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 157–68 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20363 | pmid = 16435299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes'') may use magnetoreception when predating small rodents. When foxes perform their high-jumps onto small prey like mice and voles, they tend to jump in a north-eastern compass direction. In addition, successful attacks are "tightly clustered" to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox 'rangefinder' sense expands the magnetic menagerie |url= http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/01/fox_rangefinder_sense_expands.html |website=blogs.nature.com |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] / Macmillan |accessdate=6 June 2014 |pp=&lt;!--This is an official blog of the journal ''Nature'', and subject to editorial control. It is not a self-published source.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study has found that when domestic dogs are off the leash and the Earth's magnetic field is calm, they prefer to urinate and defecate with their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=Vlastimil|first2=Petra |last2=Nováková |first3=Erich Pascal |last3=Malkemper |first4=Sabine |last4=Begall |first5=Vladimír |last5=Hanzal |first6=Miloš |last6=Ježek |first7=Tomáš |last7=Kušta |first8=Veronika |last8=Němcová |first9=Jana |last9=Adámková |first10=Kateřina |last10=Benediktová |first11=Jaroslav |last11=Červený |first12=Hynek|last12= Burda|title=Dogs are sensitive to small variations of the Earth's magnetic field|journal=Frontiers in Zoology|year=2013|url=http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/10/1/80/abstract|accessdate=February 25, 2014|doi=10.1186/1742-9994-10-80 |volume=10 |issue=1|pages=80 |pmid=24370002 |pmc=3882779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence for magnetoreception in large mammals.  Resting and grazing cattle as well as [[roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus'') and [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'') tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic north-south direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Begall | first1 = S. | last2 = Cerveny | first2 = J. | last3 = Neef | first3 = J. | last4 = Vojtech | first4 = O. | last5 = Burda | first5 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Magnetic alignment in grazing and resting cattle and deer | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 105 | issue = 36| pages = 13451–13455 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0803650105| pmid = 18725629 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..10513451B | pmc = 2533210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because wind, sunshine, and slope could be excluded as common ubiquitous factors in this study, alignment toward the vector of the magnetic field provided the most likely explanation for the observed behaviour. However, because of the descriptive nature of this study, alternative explanations (e.g., the sun compass) could not be excluded.  In a follow-up study, researchers analyzed body orientations of ruminants in localities where the geomagnetic field is disturbed by high-voltage power lines to determine how local variation in magnetic fields may affect orientation behaviour.  This was done by using satellite and aerial images of herds of cattle and field observations of grazing roe deer.  Body orientation of both species was random on pastures under or near power lines.  Moreover, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.  The disturbing effect of the power lines on body alignment diminished with the distance from the conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burda | first1 = H. | last2 = Begalla | first2 = S. | last3 = Červený | first3 = J. | last4 = Neefa | first4 = J. | last5 = Němecd | first5 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields disrupt magnetic alignment of ruminants | url = | journal = Proc.

Humans "are not believed to have a magnetic sense", but humans do have a cryptochrome (a flavoprotein, CRY2) in the retina which has a light-dependent magnetosensitivity. CRY2 "has the molecular capability to function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor", so the area was thought (2011) to be ripe for further study.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

==Issues==
The largest issue affecting verification of an animal magnetic sense is that despite more than 50 years of work on magnetoreception there has yet to be an identification of a sensory receptor.&lt;ref name="Gould, J. L. 1984"/&gt;  Given that the entire receptor system could likely fit in a one-millimeter cube and have a magnetic content of less than one ppm, it is difficult to discern the parts of the brain where this information is processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirschvink|first=J.L.|title=Magnetoreception: homing in on vertebrates|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=390|issue=6658|doi=10.1038/36986|bibcode = 1997Natur.390..339K|pages=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In various organisms a cryptochrome mediated receptor has been implicated in magnetoreception. At the same time a magnetite-based system has been suggested to be relevant to magnetosensation in birds. The third proposed mechanism (electromagnetic induction) has still not been tested in non-aquatic animals. Furthermore, it is possible that two complementary mechanisms play a role in magnetic field detection in animals. This dual mechanism theory in birds raises the questions: If such a mechanism is actually responsible for magnetoreception, to what degree is each method responsible for stimulus transduction, and how do they lead to a transducible signal given a magnetic field with the Earth’s strength?&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt;

The precise use of magnetoreception in animal navigation is unclear. Some animals appear to use their magnetic sense as a map, compass, or compass calibrator. The compass method allows animals not only to find north, but also to maintain a constant heading in a particular direction. Although the ability to sense direction is important in migratory navigation, many animals also have the ability to sense small fluctuations in earth’s magnetic field to compute coordinate maps with a resolution of a few kilometers or better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=J.L.|title=Animal navigation: the evolution of magnetic orientation|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=11|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.03.052|pmid=18522823|pages=R482–R484}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, birds such as the homing pigeon are believed to use the magnetite in their beaks to detect magnetic signposts and thus, the magnetic sense they gain from this pathway is a possible map.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt; Yet, it has also been suggested that homing pigeons and other birds use the visually mediated cryptochrome receptor as a compass.&lt;ref name="Rodgers, C. T. 2009"/&gt;

The purpose of magnetoreception in birds and other animals may be varied, but has proved difficult to study. Numerous studies use magnetic fields larger than the Earth’s field. Studies such as of ''Tritonia'' have used electrophysiological recordings from only one or two neurons, and many others have been solely correlative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=Need once cite for each of the three, or a single cite, e.g. to a literature review, that covers all three.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1750">The '''mixed mating model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that describes the [[mating system]] of a [[plant]] [[population]] in terms of the degree of [[self-fertilisation]] present. It is a fairly simplistic model, employing several simplifying assumptions, most notably the assumption that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or [[outcrossing]] with a completely [[random]] mate. Thus the only model [[parameter]] to be [[parameter estimation|estimated]] is the [[probability]] of self-fertilisation.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A. H. D.| year = 1989 | chapter = Isozyme analysis of plant mating systems |editor1=[[Soltis, D. E.]] |editor2=[[Soltis, P. S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixed mating model originated in the 1910s, with [[plant breeding|plant breeders]] who were seeking evidence of [[outcrossing]] contamination of self-pollinating [[crop]]s, but a formal description of the model and its parameter estimation was not published until 1951. The model is still in common use today, though a number of more complex models are also now in use. For example, a weakness of the model lies in its assumption that [[inbreeding]] occurs only as a result of self-fertilisation; in reality, inbreeding may also occur through outcrossing between closely related individuals. The [[effective selfing model]] relaxes this assumption by seeking also to estimate the degree of shared ancestry of outcrossing mates.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

[[File:Letter of Kanamaru.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of traditional Okinawan writing circa 1471]]

[[Okinawan language]], spoken in [[Okinawa Island]], was once the official language of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]. At the time, documents were written in [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]], derived from [[Japan]]. 

Nowadays, most Japanese, as well as most Okinawans, tend to think of Okinawan as merely a dialect of [[Standard Japanese]], even though the language is not mutually intelligible to Japanese speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ryu Central Okinawan at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; As a "dialect", modern Okinawan language is not written frequently. When it is, [[Japanese writing system|the Japanese writing system]] is generally used with an ''ad hoc'' manner. There is no standard [[orthography]] for the modern language. Nonetheless, there are a few systems announced by scholars and laypeople alike. None of them are widespread among the native speakers, but those systems can write the language with less ambiguity than the ''ad hoc'' conventions. The Roman alphabet in some form or another is used in some publications, especially those of an academic nature.

==Systems==
===Conventional usages===
The modern conventional ''ad hoc'' spellings found in Okinawa.

===Council system===
The system devised by the Council for the Dissemination of Okinawan Dialect ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070307035533/http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~knaka/hogen/index.html 沖縄方言普及協議会]). [https://web.archive.org/web/20011031162127/http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/spe/kotoba20010829.html]

===University of the Ryukyus system===
The system devised by [http://ryukyu-lang.lib.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/srnh/sign.html Okinawa Center of Language Study], a section of [[University of the Ryukyus]]. Unlike others, this method is intended purely as a phonetic guidance, basically uses [[katakana]] only. For the sake of an easier comparison, corresponding hiragana are used in this article.

===New Okinawan letters===
新沖縄文字 (''Shin Okinawa-moji''), devised by {{Nihongo|Yoshiaki Funazu|船津好明|Funazu Yoshiaki}}, in his textbook ''Utsukushii Okinawa no Hōgen'' (美しい沖縄の方言; "The beautiful Okinawan Dialect"; {{ISBN|4-905784-19-0}}). The rule applies to hiragana only. Katakana is used as in Japanese; just like in the conventional usage of Okinawan.

{{creationism2}}

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him.

The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included.

{{Nihongo|'''''Otaku'''''|おたく/オタク}} is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, particularly in [[anime and manga fandom|anime and manga]]. Its contemporary use originated with [[Akio Nakamori]]'s 1983 essay in ''[[Manga Burikko]]''.&lt;ref name="transscript of original essay text (Japanese)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burikko.net/people/otaku01.html |script-title=ja:『おたく』の研究（１） 街には『おたく』がいっぱい 中森明夫 （1983年6月号） |publisher=Burikko.net|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English translation of original essay text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neojaponisme.com/2008/04/02/what-kind-of-otaku-are-you/ |title=Otaku Research #1 "This City is Full of Otaku" by Nakamori Akio (Translated by Matt Alt) |publisher=Néojaponisme}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otaku'' may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from a stereotypical view of otaku and the media's reporting on [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], "The Otaku Murderer", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku,&lt;ref name="mynavi"/&gt; both in Japan and elsewhere.

Otaku subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the release of works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' before it branched into [[Comic Market]]. The definition of otaku subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of otaku emerged. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided otaku into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single otaku interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, [[Japanese idol|idol]] and electronics otaku. The economic impact of otaku has been estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).&lt;ref name=money /&gt;

==Etymology==
''Otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:お宅|お宅]],}} ''otaku''). This word is often used metaphorically, as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is "you". For example, early in the anime ''[[Macross]]'', first aired in 1982, the characters [[Hikaru Ichijyo]] and [[Lynn Minmay]] use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SDFMeps3and4"/&gt; The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (おたく), [[katakana]] (オタク or, less frequently, ヲタク) or rarely in [[rōmaji]], first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]]. His 1983 series {{nihongo|''Research for "Otaku"''|『おたく』の研究|"Otaku" no Kenkyū}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]'', applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Shōji Kawamori]] had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt; Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans.&lt;ref name="NRI"/&gt; Morikawa Kaichirō, an author and lecturer at [[Meiji University]], identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.&lt;ref name="essay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Otaku Encyclopedia|author=Patrick W. Galbraith|date=2009|publisher=Kodansha|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author [[Motoko Arai]], who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 ''Variety'' magazine essay.&lt;ref name="greece"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|The source contains an excerpt of the introduction of the book ''Otaku Spaces'' by Patrick W. Galbraith. Published Spring 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9844576-5-6}}. This source was not consulted directly for this citation. An except also exists on Androniki Christodoulou's blog, the photographer of the book.}}&lt;ref name="Otaku Spaces Book"/&gt;

In 1989, the case of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], "The Otaku Murderer", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention.&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt; Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and [[slasher film]]s that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine ''Bessatsu Takarajima'' dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of otaku. It was called {{nihongo|''Otaku no Hon''|おたくの本|lit. The Book of Otaku}} and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.&lt;ref name="Nippon_Foundation"/&gt;

==Usage==
In modern Japanese slang, the term ''otaku'' is mostly equivalent to "[[geek]]" or "[[nerd]]", but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; However, it can relate to any [[Fan (person)|fan]] of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; "When these people are referred to as otaku, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an “otaku” as a person unable to relate to reality".&lt;ref name="Otaku: Is it a dirty word?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"/&gt;  The word entered English as a [[loanword]] from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a [[Fan (person)|fan]] of [[anime]]/[[manga]] but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine ''[[Otaku USA]]'' popularizes and covers these aspects.&lt;ref name="Home - Otaku USA Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan /&gt; The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of ''[[Gunbuster]]'', which referred to anime fans as otaku. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about [[Otaku no Video]]'s portrayal of otaku before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed.&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt; The term was also popularized by [[William Gibson]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Idoru]]'', which references otaku.&lt;ref name="Modern boys and mobile girls"/&gt;

==Sub-culture==
Morikawa Kaichirō identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a [[caste system]], but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt;

Even prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of ''Fan Rōdo'' (Fan road) about "culture clubs".&lt;ref name="essay"/&gt; These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered [[Comiket|Comic Market]], the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt;

The 1989 "Otaku Murderer" case gave a negative connotation to the fandom from which it has not fully recovered. The usage of "(interest) otaku", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative.&lt;ref name=essay /&gt; The identification of otaku turned negative in late 2004 when [[Kaoru Kobayashi (murderer)|Kaoru Kobayashi]] kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist [[Akihiro Ōtani]] suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed by a member of the [[figure moe zoku]] even before his arrest.&lt;ref name="picnic2004"/&gt; Although Kobayashi was not an otaku, the degree of social hostility against otaku increased. Otaku were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in otaku materials.&lt;ref name="Otaku harassed as sex-crime fears mount"/&gt;

Not all attention has been negative. In his book, ''Otaku'', [[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Hiroki Azuma]] observed: "Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan", citing the fact that "[i]n 2003, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Academy Award]] for his ''[[Spirited Away]]''; around the same time [[Takashi Murakami]] achieved recognition for otaku-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the [[9th International Architecture Exhibition|2004 International Architecture exhibition]] of the [[Venice Biennale]] ([[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale Architecture]]) featured “otaku”. In 2005, the word ''moe'' - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen as one of the top ten  “buzzwords of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Azuma |first=Hiroki |date=April 10, 2009 |title=Otaku |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/otaku |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press | chapter= Preface |page = xi|isbn=978-0816653515 |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Tarō Asō|Taro Aso]] has also claimed to be an otaku, using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="Otaku uses manga and anime to improve Foreign Affairs"/&gt; In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of otaku. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.&lt;ref name="mynavi"/&gt;

===Places===
The district of [[Akihabara]] in Tokyo, where there are [[maid café]]s featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.&lt;ref name="Akihabara"/&gt; Another popular location is [[Otome Road]] in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In [[Nagoya]], students from [[Nagoya City University]] started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture to attract more otaku to the city.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt;

===Subtypes===
There are specific terms for different types of otaku, including {{nihongo|Fujoshi|腐女子||lit. "rotten girl"}}, a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of [[yaoi]], which focuses on [[homosexual]] male relationships.&lt;ref name="Mari"/&gt; ''[[Reki-jo]]'' are female otaku who are interested in [[Japanese history]]. Some terms refer to a location, such as ''[[Akiba-kei]]'', a slang term meaning "[[Akihabara]]-style" which applies to those familiar with Akihabara's culture. Another is {{Nihongo|[[Wotagei]] or otagei|ヲタ芸 or オタ芸}}, a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei. Other terms, such as {{nihongo|[[Itasha]]|痛車}}, literally "painful car", describe vehicles who are decorated with fictional characters, especially [[bishōjo game]] or [[eroge]] characters.&lt;ref name="Itasha: Japan's Creepiest Car Fetish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Behold. A Fleet of Cars Owned by Nerds."/&gt;

===Media===
Otaku often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as [[Otaku no Video]], which contains a live-interview [[mockumentary]] that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes [[Gainax]]'s own staff as the interviewees.&lt;ref name="Buried Treasure - In Praise of Nerdiness"/&gt; Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as ''[[Genshiken]]'' and ''[[Comic Party]]''. A well-known novel-come-manga-come-anime is ''[[Welcome to the N.H.K.]]'', which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the [[hikikomori]] and [[NEET]]s. Works that focus on an otaku character include ''[[WataMote]]'', the story of an unattractive and unsociable [[otome game]] otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork"/&gt; Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork2004"/&gt;

==Types and classification of Japanese otaku==
[[File:Railfantokyo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Railfan]]s taking photos of trains at an annual depot open-day event in Tokyo in August 2011]]
The Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into otaku, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005.&lt;ref name="nri2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nri2005"/&gt; The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of otaku interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and ¥83 billion market scale. [[Japanese idol|Idol]] otaku were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and ¥61 billion. Travel otaku with 250,000 individuals and ¥81 billion. PC otaku with 190,000 individuals and ¥36 billion. Video game otaku with 160,000 individuals and ¥21 billion. Automobile otaku with 140,000 individuals and ¥54 billion. Animation (anime) otaku with 110,000 individuals and ¥20 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment otaku, with 70,000 individuals and ¥8 billion; Audio-visual equipment otaku, with 60,000 individuals and ¥12 billion; camera otaku, with 50,000 individuals and ¥18 billion; fashion otaku, with 40,000 individuals and ¥13 billion; and railway otaku, with 20,000 individuals and ¥4 billion.&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt; These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the "unique psychological characteristics" of otaku used in the 2005 study.&lt;ref name="nri2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt;

NRI's 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of otaku. The first is the family-oriented otaku, who has broad interests and is more mature than other otaku; their object of interest is secretive and they are "closet otaku". The second is the serious "leaving my own mark on the world" otaku, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields. The third type is the "media-sensitive multiple interest" otaku, whose diverse interests are shared with others. The fourth type is the "outgoing and assertive otaku", who gain recognition by promoting their hobby. The last is the "fan magazine-obsessed otaku", which is predominately female with a small group of males being the "[[Moe (slang)|moe]] type"; the secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.&lt;ref name="nri2005" /&gt; The Hamagin Research Institute found that moe-related content was worth ¥88.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Japan based ''Tokyo Otaku Mode'' a place for news relating to Otaku has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.&lt;ref name="Tokyo Otaku Mode has 10 million Facebook fans but now what"/&gt;

Other classifications of otaku interests include vocaloid, cosplay, figures and professional wrestling as categorized by the Yano Research Institute. Yano Research reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by otaku consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% growth in [[dating sim]] and online gaming otaku, while [[vocaloid]], [[cosplay]], idols and [[Maid café|maid services]] grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.&lt;ref name="Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2011"/&gt;

'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]].  A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma.

Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. 

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2.&lt;ref&gt;RICHARD FLORIDA. (2016, April 14). Big Cities Are the Future of Global Consumption.

==Causes==
In understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. &lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market.

Two main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt; This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. 
As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. &lt;ref&gt;The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

==Effects==
{{See also|I PAT}}
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]].

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. &lt;ref&gt;Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
&lt;/ref&gt;

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. &lt;ref&gt;Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer-waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study
&lt;/ref&gt;


The scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an [[overclass]] to exist, displaying  [[affluenza]] and [[obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nierenberg|first1=Danielle|title=State of the World 2006: a Worldwatch Institute report on progress toward a sustainable society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/state-of-the-world-2006-a-worldwatch-institute-report-on-progress-toward-a-sustainable-society/oclc/62865904|website=Worldcat|publisher=New York; London: W.W. Norton|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpopulation and overconsumption|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/306/6888/1285|website=BMJ|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|title=World needs to stabilise population and cut consumption, says Royal Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/EnvIssues/Population/Result.asp Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved on 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst case a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. [[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption.  Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lester R. |title=World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse |publisher=Norton |series=Earth Policy Institute |year=2011 |page=7 |isbn =113654075X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Renner|first=Michael|title=State of the world 2005: A Worldwatch Institute Report on progress toward a sustainable society.|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3866|accessdate=2009-09-14|date=January 2006|publisher=[[W.W. Norton]]|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32666-7|oclc=57470324|chapter=Chapter 1: China, India, and the New World Order|chapterurl=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] 2005 report said the two countries' high [[economic growth]] exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Footprint==

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.|source=—[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], biologist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.”  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" /&gt;  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PDCA''' ('''plan–do–check–act''' or '''plan–do–check–adjust''') is an [[iterative]] four-step [[management]] method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tague |first=Nancy R. |date=2005 |origyear=1995 |chapter=Plan–Do–Study–Act cycle |title=The quality toolbox |edition=2nd |location=Milwaukee |publisher=[[ASQ Quality Press]] |pages=390–392 |isbn=0873896394 |oclc=57251077 |chapterurl=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/project-planning-tools/overview/pdca-cycle.html |accessdate=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''[[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] circle'''/'''cycle'''/'''wheel''', the '''[[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] cycle''', the '''control circle'''/'''cycle''', or '''plan–do–study–act''' ('''PDSA'''). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA.&lt;ref&gt;Foresight University, The Foresight Guide, Shewhart's Learning and Deming's Quality Cycle, [http://www.foresightguide.com/shewhart-and-deming/]&lt;/ref&gt; The added "O" stands for ''observation'' or as some versions say: "Observe the current condition." This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on [[lean manufacturing]] and the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rother |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Rother |date=2010 |title=[[Toyota Kata|Toyota kata: managing people for improvement, adaptiveness, and superior results]] |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0071635238 |oclc=318409119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDCA cycle, with Ishikawa’s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:PDCA Process.png|thumb|350px|right|Continuous quality improvement with PDCA]]

===Plan===
The planning phase involves assessing a current process, or a new process, and figuring out how it can be improved upon. Knowing what types of outputs are desired helps to develop a plan to fix or improve the process. It is often easier to plan smaller changes during this phase of the plan so that they can be easily monitored and the outputs are more predictable. Establish the objectives and necessary to deliver results in accordance with the expected output (the target or goals)

===Do===
The do phase allows the plan from the previous step to be enacted. Small changes are usually tested, and data is gathered to see how effective the change is.

===Check===
During the check phase, the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the PDCA cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others, and if said changes can be improved as well.

Example: Gap analysis, or Appraisals

===Act===
If the '''check phase''' shows that the '''plan phase''' which was implemented in '''do phase''' is an improvement to the prior standard (baseline), then that becomes the new standard (baseline) for how the organization should '''act''' going forward (new standards are thus said to be ''enACTed''). Instead, if the '''check phase''' shows that the '''plan phase''' which was implemented in '''do phase''' is not an improvement, then the existing standard (baseline) will remain in place. In either case, if the '''check phase''' showed something different than expected (whether better or worse), then there is some more learning to be done... and that will suggest potential future PDCA cycles. Note that some who teach PDCA assert that the '''act phase''' involves making adjustments or corrective actions, but generally it would be counter to PDCA thinking to propose and decide upon alternative changes without using a proper '''plan phase''', or to make them the new standard (baseline) without going through '''do''' and '''check''' steps.

===Adjust===
The adjust phase is the alternative version of the act phase. Once PDCA has been run multiple times, the process generally has enough information for it to be considered a new standard. This is usually completed in the act phase. The adjust phase allows the process to continue to be monitored after the changes have been implemented and fix them accordingly. Doing this lets the PDCA cycle truly be for continuous improvement instead of changing a process and letting it become inefficient again.

==About==
PDCA was made popular by [[W. Edwards Deming]], who is considered by many to be the father of modern [[Quality management|quality control]]; however, he always referred to it as the "Shewhart cycle". Later in Deming's career, he modified PDCA to "Plan, Do, Study, Act" (PDSA) because he felt that "check" emphasized inspection over analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aguayo |first=Rafael |date=1990 |title=Dr. Deming: the American who taught the Japanese about quality |series=A Lyle Stuart book |location=Secaucus, NJ |publisher=Carol Pub. Group |page=76 |isbn=0818405198 |oclc=22347078 |ref=harv}} Also published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The PDSA cycle was used to create the model of know-how transfer process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubickis |first1=Mikus |last2=Gaile-Sarkane |first2=Elīna |date=December 2017 |title=Transfer of know-how based on learning outcomes for development of open innovation |journal=Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4 |doi=10.1186/s40852-017-0053-4 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40852-017-0053-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dubberly |first=Hugh |date=2008 |origyear=2004 |title=How do you design?: a compendium of models |url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/how-do-you-design.html |website=dubberly.com |accessdate=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of PDCA is based on the [[scientific method]], as developed from the work of [[Francis Bacon]] (''[[Novum Organum]]'', 1620). The scientific method can be written as "hypothesis–experiment–evaluation" or as "plan–do–check". [[Walter A. Shewhart]] described manufacture under "control"—under statistical control—as a three-step process of specification, production, and inspection.&lt;ref name="Shewhart 1939"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shewhart |first=Walter Andrew |authorlink=Walter A. Shewhart |year=1986 |origyear=1939 |title=Statistical method from the viewpoint of quality control |location=New York |publisher=Dover |isbn=0486652327 |oclc=13822053 |ref=harv}} Reprint. Originally published: Washington, DC: Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} He also specifically related this to the scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, and evaluation. Shewhart says that the statistician "must help to change the demand [for goods] by showing [...] how to close up the tolerance range and to improve the quality of goods."&lt;ref name="Shewhart 1939"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Clearly, Shewhart intended the analyst to take action based on the conclusions of the evaluation. According to Deming, during his lectures in Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese participants shortened the steps to the now traditional ''plan, do, check, act''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming |first=W. Edwards |authorlink=W. Edwards Deming |year=1986 |title=Out of the crisis |page=88 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Center for Advanced Engineering Study |isbn=0911379010 |oclc=13126265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming preferred ''plan, do, study, act'' because "study" has connotations in English closer to Shewhart's intent than "check".&lt;ref name="MoenNorman"&gt;{{cite web |first1= Ronald |last1=Moen |first2=Clifford |last2=Norman |title=Evolution of the PDCA cycle |url=http://www.westga.edu/~dturner/PDCA.pdf |website=westga.edu |publisher=Paper delivered to the Asian Network for Quality Conference in Tokyo on September 17, 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PDCA-Multi-Loop.png|thumb|400px|right|Multiple iterations of the PDCA cycle are repeated until the problem is solved.]]A fundamental principle of the scientific method and PDCA is iteration—once a hypothesis is confirmed (or negated), executing the cycle again will extend the knowledge further. Repeating the PDCA cycle can bring its users closer to the goal, usually a perfect operation and output.&lt;ref name="MoenNorman"/&gt;

Another fundamental function of PDCA is the "hygienic" separation of each phase, for if not properly separated measurements of effects due to various simultaneous actions (causes) risk becoming confounded.&lt;ref name="Berengueres 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berengueres |first=José |title=The Toyota production system re-contextualized |year=2007 |location=Tokyo |publisher=José Berengueres |isbn=1847534775 |oclc=906982187 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDCA (and other forms of scientific problem solving) is also known as a system for developing critical thinking. At Toyota this is also known as "Building people before building cars".&lt;ref name="Liker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Liker |first=Jeffrey K. |title=The Toyota way: 14 management principles from the world's greatest manufacturer |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=0071392319 |oclc=54005437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota and other [[lean manufacturing]] companies propose that an engaged, problem-solving workforce using PDCA in a culture of critical thinking is better able to innovate and stay ahead of the competition through rigorous problem solving and the subsequent innovations.&lt;ref name="Liker"/&gt;

Deming continually emphasized iterating towards an improved system, hence PDCA should be repeatedly implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} One can envision an open coil spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is based on the belief that our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the PDCA—scientific method—provides feedback to justify guesses (hypotheses) and increase knowledge. Rather than enter "[[analysis paralysis]]" to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With improved knowledge, one may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). The aim of the PDCA cycle is to bring its users closer to whatever goal they choose.&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"/&gt;{{rp|160}}

When PDCA is used for complex projects or products with a certain controversy, checking with external stakeholders should happen before the Do stage, since changes to projects and products that are already in detailed design can be costly; this is also seen as Plan-Check-Do-Act.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Rate of change, that is, rate of improvement, is a key competitive factor in today's world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} PDCA allows for major "jumps" in performance ("breakthroughs" often desired in a Western approach), as well as [[kaizen]] (frequent small improvements).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the United States a PDCA approach is usually associated with a sizable project involving numerous people's time,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and thus managers want to see large "breakthrough" improvements to justify the effort expended. However, the scientific method and PDCA apply to all sorts of projects and improvement activities.&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

'''Personality systematics''' is a contribution to the psychology of [[personality theory|personality]] and to [[psychological counselling|psychotherapy]] summarized by Jeffrey J. Magnavita in 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name="rfs"&gt;Magnavita, Jeffrey J. (2009) Psychodynamic Family Psychotherapy: Toward Unified Relational Systematics. In Bray, James H., Stanton, Mark (Eds.) ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Family Psychology''. John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6994-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnavita, Jeffrey J. (2006) ''Treating personality disorders'' [American Psychological Association Videotape]. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of the interrelationships among [[subsystems]] of personality as they are embedded in the entire [[ecological systems|ecological system]]. The model falls into the category of complex,  [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approaches to personality. The term personality systematics was originally coined by [[William Grant Dahlstrom]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="rfsa"&gt;Dahlstrom, William Grant (1972) ''Personality systematics and the problem of types''. General Learning Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Systems psychology has emerged here as a new approach in which groups and individuals, are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Within [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s they have an active method of remaining stable through the dynamic relationship between parts.&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt; A classic example of this homeostatic dynamic is the "problem behavior" of a bed wetting child having a stabilizing function of holding a troubled marriage together because the attention of the parents is drawn away from their conflict towards the "problem" child.

More recent developments in systems psychology have challenged this understanding of homeostasis as being too focused on causal understanding of systems. This change in thought from 1st order [[cybernetics]] to [[Second-order cybernetics|2nd order cybernetics]] involved a [[postmodern]] shift in understanding of reality as [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] to being socially and linguistically [[Constructivist epistemology|constructed]].

[[Family systems therapy]] received an important boost in the mid-1950s through the work of anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] and colleagues – [[Jay Haley]], [[Donald D. Jackson]], [[John Weakland]], William Fry, and later, [[Virginia Satir]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and others – at Palo Alto in the US, who introduced ideas from cybernetics and general systems theory into social psychology and psychotherapy, focusing in particular on the role of communication. This approach eschewed the traditional focus on individual psychology and historical factors – that involve so-called linear causation and content – and emphasized instead feedback and homeostatic mechanisms and “rules” in here-and-now interactions – so-called circular causation and process – that were thought to maintain or exacerbate problems, whatever the original cause(s).

[[Relational psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref name="rfsm"&gt;Greenberg, Jay R., Mitchell, Stephen A. (1983) ''Object relations in psychoanalytic theory.'' Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; began in the 1980s as an attempt to integrate [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]]'s emphasis on the detailed exploration of interpersonal interactions with British [[object relations theory]]'s sophisticated ideas about the psychological importance of internalized relationships with other people.  Relationalists argue that [[personality psychology|personality]] emerges from the matrix of early formative relationships with parents and other figures. Philosophically, relational psychoanalysis is closely allied with [[social constructionism]].&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Personality systematics.jpg|thumb|Personality systematics|450px|right]]
Personality systematics seeks to establish the underlying processes within the domains of the larger system. The domains range from what can be observed from the microlevel to the macrolevel domains.

Personality can be conceptualized as an emergent phenomena of the convergent forces and their expressions which can be compared to a holographic representation. Personality systematics is based on a holistic model of functioning which considers part-whole relationships as being essential to understanding complex self-organizing systems.

The model describes four levels of the personality system:
*Level I, intrapsychic-biological, including cognitive and affective experiences;
*Level II, interpersonal-dyadic (the two-person system), regulating the tension between intimacy and separateness, and including past, current, and expected relationships;
*Level III, relational-triadic matrix, representing the relations among a primary dyad and a third person;
*Level IV, sociocultural familial triangle, depicting the synergy between the individual personality system, the family system, and the cultural system, and shaping how genetic predispositions and vulnerabilities will be expressed.&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

==Applications in treatment==
This model has been used in treating complex clinical syndromes, personality dysfunction, and relational disturbances. To enhance efficacy and range, new methods are used, such as audiovisual recording and [[physiological]] measurements, [[galvanic skin response]], [[heart rate]] variability, and other forms of [[Biofeedback|bio]]- and [[Neurofeedback|neuro-feedback]].&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

'''Political violence in Turkey''' became a challenging problem in late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Zürcher| first = Erik J.| title = Turkey A Modern History, Revised Edition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qaC24BFy4JQC&amp;pg=PA263| year = 2004| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-1-85043-399-6| page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence was even described as a "low-level war".&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; The death squads of Turkish right-wing ultra-nationalist groups against left-wing opposition inflicted some 5,000 casualties. The wave of violence dimmed after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]].

==History==

===Background===
In 1975 [[Süleyman Demirel]], president of the conservative [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] ({{lang-tr|Adalet Partisi}}, AP) succeeded [[Bülent Ecevit]], president of the social-democratic [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] ({{lang-tr|Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi}}, CHP) as Prime Minister. He formed a coalition called "the Nationalist Front ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Cephe}})" with [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s Islamist [[National Salvation Party]] ({{lang-tr|Millî Selamet Partisi}}, MSP), and [[Alparslan Türkeş]]' far right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi}}, MHP). The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war that was waging between rival factions.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;Gil, Ata. "La Turquie à marche forcée," ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', February 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish general election, 1977|elections of 1977]] had no winner. First, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front, but in 1978, Ecevit was able to get to power again with the help of some deputies who had shifted from one party to another. In 1979, Demirel once again became Prime Minister. At the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems facing strike actions and partial paralysis of politics (the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] was unable to elect a President during the six months preceding the coup). Since 1968–69, a [[proportional representation]] system had made it difficult to find any parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial [[bourgeoisie]], which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other [[social class]]es such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms requested by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Henceforth, the politicians seemed unable to combat the growing violence in the country.

===Sequence of events===
Unprecedented political violence had erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra-nationalist [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]], youth organisation of the [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], claimed they were supporting the security forces.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite book| title = Turkey| year = 1988| publisher = Amnesty International| isbn = 978-0-86210-156-5| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight magazine]]'', in 1978 there were 3,319 [[fascist]] attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded.&lt;ref name="searchlight"&gt;''[[Searchlight (magazine)]]'', No.47 (May 1979), pg. 6. Quoted by {{Harvard citation|Herman|Brodhead|1986|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the central trial against the left-wing organization [[Devrimci Yol]] (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. The others could not clearly be related.&lt;ref&gt;Devrimci Yol Savunması (Defense of the Revolutionary Path). Ankara, January 1989, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 [[Bahçelievler Massacre]], the 1977 [[Taksim Square massacre]] with 35 victims and the 1978 [[Maraş massacre]] with over 100 victims are some notable incidents. Martial law was announced following the [[Kahramanmaraş Massacre]] in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. At the time of the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|coup]] martial law had been extended to 20 provinces.

Ecevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by [[Nuri Gündeş]] of the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT). Ecevit then told his interior minister, [[İrfan Özaydınlı]], who then told [[Sedat Celasun]]—one of the five generals who would lead the coup. The deputy undersecretary of the MİT, Nihat Yıldız, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |accessdate=2008-12-18 |title=Çalınan silahlar falcıya soruldu |date=2007-07-17 |first=Ferhat |last=Ünlü |work=Sabah |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830082751/http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |archivedate=30 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdish separatism==
{{POV-section|date=November 2014}}
The right-wing groups were opposed towards Kurdish separatism. Disproportionate numbers of Kurds were part of the left-wing groups. Most of the left was also Turkish nationalist and opposed towards separatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Romano| first = David| title = The Kurdish Nationalist Movement Opportunity, Mobilization and Identity| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ohSNu6bidEQC&amp;pg=PA46| year = 2006| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-68426-2| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the coup of 1980 only a minority of the violence was committed by separatists, after that it increased.

{{rape}}
After a [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]], victims are often subjected to [[scrutiny]] and, in some cases, [[Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims#Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse|mistreatment]].  Victims undergo medical examinations and are interviewed by police.  If there is a criminal trial, victims suffer a loss of [[privacy]] and their [[credible witness|credibility]] may be challenged.  Victims may also become the target of [[slut-shaming]], abuse, [[social stigma]]tization, [[sexual slur]]s and [[cyberbullying]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Various laws have been created with a motive to protect victims.  During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] protect victims from excessive public scrutiny.  Laws may also prohibit defence lawyers from obtaining a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records.   [[Statutory rape]] laws set the age of legal consent for sexual activity and prohibits perpetrators from alleging the victim consented to the activity.  Victims in some jurisdictions can seek damages from police and institutions if warnings were not issued.  Numerous victims' rights groups operate to improve the treatment of victims.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Examination and investigation of victim==
{{See|Rape#Treatment}}

===Medical examination ===
{{Main| Rape kit}}
Examiners may also collect fingernail scrapings and pluck head and pubic hairs.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Feeney|first2=Hannah|last3=Fehler-Cabral|first3=Giannina|last4=Shaw|first4=Jessica|last5=Horsford|first5=Sheena|title=The National Problem of Untested Sexual Assault Kits (SAKs): Scope, Causes, and Future Directions for Research, Policy, and Practice|journal=Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse|date=December 23, 2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1177/1524838015622436}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the facility has the means, and the victim consents, the examiner will also take photographs of genital injuries.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits" /&gt;  A '[[rape kit]]' contains the items used by medical personnel for gathering and preserving physical evidence.

Many "rape kits" are untested because they are never submitted to [[crime lab]]s or because crime labs have insufficient resources to [[DNA profiling|test]] all of the submitted kits.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RAINN backlog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing the Rape Kit Backlog|url=https://rainn.org/public-policy/legislative-agenda/fighting-sexual-violence-with-DNA|website=Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|publisher=RAINN|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell (2016) re Serial Rapists"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=R.|last2=Feeney|first2=H.|last3=Pierce|first3=S.

The [[Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act|Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016]] was enacted by the United States federal government on October 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text?resultIndex=3|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act gives victims the right: 
* to request the preservation of sexual assault evidence collection kit or its probative contents.
* to have the sexual assault evidence collection kit preserved, without charge, for the duration of the maximum applicable statute of limitations or 20 years, whichever is shorter
* to be informed of any result of a sexual assault evidence collection kit, including a DNA profile match, toxicology report, or other information collected as part of a medical forensic examination, if such disclosure would not impede or compromise an ongoing investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|location=Chapter 238 - Section 3772|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interview by police===
As part of police investigations, victims are interviewed by police.  The interview is usually recorded, a transcript may be prepared and the interview may be made available to the public.  Discrepancies between the victim's statements to police and other evidence are grounds for the defence lawyer to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the [[credible witness|credibility]] of the victim.

In investigations involving [[acquaintance rape|acquaintance]] or [[date rape]], the electronic communications between the accused and the victim may be reviewed in order to determine if the victim [[consent]]ed to the sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Zuker|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Court of Justice|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 52 to 55|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|New York appeals court]] determined that emails from the alleged victim should be included in evidence and that the [[rape shield law]] did not apply.  The alleged victim had written about her sadomasochistic interests and experiences.

In Canada, a defense lawyer may be allowed to obtain copies of the victim's e-mails and other private documents using a legal procedure called a third-party records application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sarah Boesveld|authorlink1=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/news/how-did-ghomehis-defence-get-hold-of-5000-messages-between-complainants/|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=Chatelaine|title=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If police believe the reported victim is making a [[false accusation of rape]], they may interrogate that person as a suspect rather than a victim.  In some cases, harsh questioning and social stigmatization has caused even actual victims of rape to recant and then be charged with making a false report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America |year=2018 |last=Miller |first=T. Christian |isbn= 978-1524759933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality, harassment, smear campaigns and silencing===
{{See also|Nate Parker#1999 rape charges}}
In Canada, pursuant to sections 278.1 to 278.91 of the ''Criminal Code'' defence counsel are not allowed to obtain a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 278.1 - Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-65.html#docCont|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada even though it limited the accused ability to provide a full answer and defence; see [[R v Mills|''R. v Mills'']].

An accused may hire a private investigator to investigate and harass a victim.  For example, according to the complaint in the civil lawsuit against Penn State University,  [[Nate Parker]] hired a private investigator to investigate and harass an 18-year-old student.  The student alleged she was raped by Parker and another student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kate Briquelet|author2=M.L. Nestel|title=Inside the Nate Parker Rape Case|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/inside-the-nate-parker-rape-case.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=August 16, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoePennStateComplaint-2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe vs. Pennsylvania State University (4.02-cv-00369.JEJ)|url=https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/civil-complaint-2-wm.pdf|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=August 16, 2016|date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jacqueline Williams|author2=Serge F.

The lawsuit against Penn State was settled for $17,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mike Millar|title=Nate Parker Told Rape Accuser 'You Put Yourself in That Situation' and More Shocking Details from the 1999 Case|url=http://people.com/crime/nate-parker-rape-trial-details-from-1999-case-involving-birth-of-nation-star/|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=2 November 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Parker was found not guilty of the rape charges.  The victim attempted to commit suicide 3 months after the assault&lt;ref name=DoePennStateComplaint-2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe vs. Pennsylvania State University (4.02-cv-00369.JEJ)|url=https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/civil-complaint-2-wm.pdf|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=August 16, 2016|date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and committed suicide at age 30.)

Institutions may attempt to cover up sexual abuse, as seen in the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases]]. The movie ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' deals with the coverup of sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

[[Dennis Hastert]] allegedly promised to pay $5 million to his victim in exchange for agreeing not to discuss the sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christy Gutowski|title=Judge may rule whether lawsuit filed by Dennis Hastert victim can proceed|accessdate=|agency=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 14, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities may fail to investigate allegations of sexual assault because the victims are perceived to be unreliable witnesses.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Girls: who is Sara Rowbotham? The sexual health worker behind the uncovering of the Rochdale child-abuse scandal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/three-girls-sara-rowbotham-sexual-health-worker-hero-behind/|accessdate=27 May 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=May 23, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC One]] miniseries ''[[Three Girls (miniseries)|Three Girls]]'' deals with the systematic sexual abuse of young girls by a group of older Asian men in [[Rochdale child sex abuse ring|Rochdale]].  Authorities were slow to respond even though more than 100 referrals were made to the police and social services.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

[[Harvey Weinstein]] dispatched defense lawyers and publicists to undermine the credibility of his accusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haag|first1=Matthew|title=Harvey Weinstein Accused in Lawsuit of Sexually Assaulting Producer for Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F05%2F02%2Fnyregion%2Fharvey-weinstein-sexual-assault.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click|accessdate=2 May 2018|agency=New York Times|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus sexual assault victims==

In the United States, various legislation, government agencies, and initiatives have been created to deal with [[campus sexual assault]].  These include:

* [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]]
* [[Title IX]] requires schools receiving federal funds to protect students from gender-based violence and harassment – including sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title IX and Sexual Violence in Schools|url=https://www.aclu.org/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools?redirect=womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=12 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office for Civil Rights]]  investigates [[Title IX]] sexual violence complaints.
* The [[Campus Accountability and Safety Act]] (CASA) is a United States bill to reform the sexual assault investigation process and protect victims.  CASA includes a requirement that colleges and universities publish statistics relating to crime on their campuses.
* The [[Safe Campus Act]] is proposed U.S. legislation that would require schools to report allegations of sexual assault to law enforcement, but only if the victim consents.  However, if the victim does not consent the statute prohibits schools from initiating their own internal disciplinary procedures.

''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' is a critically acclaimed American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States.  Its creators say college administrations are failing to respond adequately to claims of sexual assault, while its critics have countered that the film was based on misleading statistics and biased against the alleged perpetrator.

==Sexual assault victims in the military==
Sexual Assault in the military is more prevalent than outside of the military and it is frequently under reported. In the United States, [[Sexual Assault Prevention Response]] (SAPR) is a training program designated to educate military service members and provide support and treatment to service members and their families.  Individuals are assigned to a SAPR Advocate to assist them with the different treatment options that are available to them and to educate them about their rights.

==Sexual assault of prisoners==

The [[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003|''Prison Rape Elimination Act'']] is United States legislation enacted for the purpose of preventing sexual assaults in U.S. prisons.  The legislation requires reporting and information gathering.

{{Main|Prison rape in the United States}}

==Publication bans, duty to warn and self-censorship==

===Publication of victim's name and publication bans===
{{Main|Publication ban}}

In the United States, laws prohibiting the publication of a victim's name have been found to be unconstitutional and struck down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/directions/chap13.htm New Directions from the Field: Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century] (Chapter 13), accessed October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]''  {{ussc|420|469|1975}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name was unconstitutional.  The Court stated: "the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection."

In Canada, the [[Canadian Press]] generally does not publish the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged victim in Quebec politician sex assault case speaks|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/alleged-victim-in-quebec-politician-sex-assault-speaks/ar-AAjeZaj?li=AAggFp5&amp;ocid=mailsignout|accessdate=22 October 2016|agency=The Canadian Press|date=October 21, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a court order may operate to prohibit publication.  Pursuant to paragraph 486.4(1)(a) of the ''[[Criminal Code]]'', the court may make an order "directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness" not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paragraph 486.4 of Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-106.html#docCont|website=Department of Justice (Canada)|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=21 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victim has the option of waiving the [[publication ban]].

===Victim may be prohibited from discussing the assault===

In cases where the accused is under 18 years of age, the court may impose a [[publication ban]] to protect the privacy of the offender.

Seventeen-year-old [[Sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich|Savannah Dietrich]] was sexually assaulted by two teenagers.  The court ordered Dietrich not to discuss the case and she was threatened to be found in [[contempt of court|contempt]] when she published the names of the perpetrators on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/23/savannah_dietrich_outs_her_rapists_on_twitter_and_facebook.html |title=Savannah Dietrich outs her rapists on Twitter and Facebook |publisher=Slate.com |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the section 110 of the  ''[[Youth Criminal Justice Act]]'' generally prohibits the publication of the name of the offender if the offender was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Criminal Justice Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/y-1.5/page-21.html#h-33|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=29 October 2016|page=Section 110|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duty to warn the public===
{{Main|Duty to warn#Criminal Activity and Sexual Assault}}

The police, colleges and universities may be required to warn the public that a sexual assault has occurred.  Women should be warned of the risk they face and have the opportunity to take any specific measures to protect themselves from future attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Macfarland|title=Doe v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police, 1998 CanLII 14826 (ON SC)|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/1998/1998canlii14826/1998canlii14826.html?autocompleteStr=jane%20doe&amp;autocompletePos=2|publisher=Ontario Court (General Division)|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=English|date=July 3, 1998|quote=Ms. Doe brings a suit against the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force (hereafter referred to as MTPF) on two bases; firstly she suggests that the MTPF conducted a negligent investigation in relation to the balcony rapist and failed to warn women whom they knew to be potential targets of Callow of the fact that they were at risk. She says, as the result of such conduct, Callow was not apprehended as early as he might otherwise have been and she was denied the opportunity, had she known the risk she faced, to take any specific measures to protect herself from attack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may sue for damages if warnings are not issued.  In 1998, a sexual assault victim successfully sued the Toronto police for their failure to warn her that a serial rapist was active in her neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe v.

In the United States, the [[Clery Act]] imposes fines on colleges and universities that fail to warn students of criminal activity on or near campuses.  The law is named after Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University student who was raped and murdered in her campus hall of residence in 1986.  In relation to the [[Jerry Sandusky]] sexual abuse scandal, U.S. federal investigators are seeking to fine Penn State University $2.4 million for failing to warn of threats to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nick Anderson|title=Feds seek record $2.4 million fine against Penn State in Sandusky scandal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/feds-seek-record-24-million-fine-against-penn-state-in-sandusky-scandal/2016/11/03/7fbe7bf8-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_pennstate-250pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|accessdate=4 November 2016|agency=Washington Post|date=November 3, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship by travel websites===
[[TripAdvisor]] apologized for repeatedly deleting forum posts about a resort where the victim had been raped by a security guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karen Schwartz|title=TripAdvisor to flag hotels where sexual assault occurred|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/09/tripadvisor-to-indicate-hotels-where-sexual-assault-occurred.html|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-censorship  ===
Self-censorship is when publications or people self-censor themselves in order to withhold information to protect their image or avoid receiving backlash. Some instances include:

* '''Self-censorship because subject is distasteful''' – Newspapers may [[self-censor]], choosing not to publish material about a sexual assault on the grounds that the subject is distasteful.  For example, there were complaints when [[The Des Moines Register]]  published stories about the rape of [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]].  One reader complained: 
::The disgusting and degrading details of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's rape have no place in a family newspaper the caliber of The Register.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Margolick|title=A Name, a Face and a Rape: Iowa Victim Tells Her Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/us/a-name-a-face-and-a-rape-iowa-victim-tells-her-story.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 February 2017|agency=New York Times|date=March 25, 1990|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-censorship because of ethnicity of the accused''' – Publication of information regarding sexual assaults may be suppressed because of fears of being thought racist.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Hall|title=Real or imagined: Racism 'fear' over Rotherham child abuse|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28951612|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English|date=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 report regarding the child sexual assaults in Rotherham, England stated: "It is believed by a number of workers that one of the difficulties that prevent this issue [child sexual exploitation] being dealt with effectively is the ethnicity of the main perpetrators."&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexis Jay OBE|title=Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham (1997 – 2013)|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham|publisher=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=9 October 2016|pages=2|language=English|quote=By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal#Reactions}}

: With respect to the [[Rochdale child sex abuse ring]], it was suggested that police and social work departments failed to act when details of the gang emerged for fear of appearing racist, and vulnerable white teenagers being groomed by Pakistani men were ignored.
{{Main|Rochdale child sex abuse ring#Reaction and public debate}}

: There were allegations of racist motivations with respect to the [[Sydney gang rapes#Racial controversy|Sydney gang rapes]].  In 2000, there were a series of gang rapes committed by Lebanese-Australian youths.

:Reporting the race of the perpetrator because of concerns about perpetuating stereotypes was a sensitive issue with respect to media coverage of the rape of [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-censorship because "women would become hysterical"''' – In 1998, the Toronto police did not issue warnings regarding a serial rapist "because women would become hysterical or panic" and "the rapist would flee and the investigation would be compromised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice MacFarland|title=Doe v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police, 1998 CanLII 14826 (ON SC)|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/1998/1998canlii14826/1998canlii14826.html?autocompleteStr=jane%20doe&amp;autocompletePos=2|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Court (General Division)|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=English|date=July 3, 1998|quote=Sergeant Cameron indicated, I find, that it was not the practice to issue warnings in such cases because women would become hysterical or panic (I do not see any real difference which word he used, the meaning is the same), the rapist would flee and the investigation would be compromised. Of course it was not true that it was not the policy of the MTPF to issue warnings in such cases because it had been done in the Dawson Davidson case -- just months earlier and in the very same division.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Toronto police were ultimately found liable for damages for [[duty to warn|failing to issue warnings]].
* '''Self-censorship to avoid harming international relations''' – Korea has agreed to refrain from criticising Japan over the issue of [[comfort women]].  During [[World War II]], many Korean women were forced to be the sex slaves of members of the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Associated Press|title=Buddhist monk sets himself on fire in South Korea over 'comfort women' deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/buddhist-monk-sets-himself-on-fire-in-south-korea-over-comfort-women-deal|accessdate=8 January 2017|agency=The Guardian|date=January 8, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Self-censorship to avoid deportation and intimidation using "rape trees"''' – Sexual assaults of illegal immigrants are rarely reported as the victims fear they may be deported after coming forward.  Women often seek out birth control methods to prevent pregnancy from anticipated sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="pbs1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/facing-risk-rape-migrant-women-prepare-birth-control/ | publisher=[[PBS]]| title=Women crossing the U.S. border face sexual assault with little protection | date=31 March 2014 | agency=Fronteras | accessdate=4 July 2015 | last1=Joffe-Block | first1=Jude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial costs==
Victims may incur various financial costs because of the sexual assault; for example, costs related to moving (to get away from the perpetrator), a new mattress, legal fees, lost wages, lost tuition fees, new clothing, therapy and medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court to hear appeal in Mandi Gray sex assault case|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2017/03/13/court-to-hear-appeal-in-mandi-gray-sex-assault-case.html|accessdate=14 March 2017|agency=Toronto Star|date=March 14, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduct of legal proceedings==
{{Main|Laws regarding rape}}

===Statutes of limitations===
A [[statute of limitations]] law may preclude a victim from pressing criminal charges.  Limitations periods vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  For example, in Pennsylvania charges must be filed within 12 years of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sydney Ember|author2=Graham Bowley|title=After Bill Cosby, States Shift on Statutes of Limitations in Sexual Assault Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/arts/television/after-bill-cosby-states-shift-sexual-assault-statutes-of-limitations.html|accessdate=7 November 2016|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=November 7, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory rape===
[[Statutory rape]] is sexual activity in which one of the individuals is below the [[age of consent]].  The age of consent is the age at which a young person is capable of [[consent]]ing to sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen v. Omar Abdallah Hajar|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2016/2016abca222/2016abca222.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAPImFnZSBvZiBjb25zZW50AAAAAAE&amp;resultIndex=7|publisher=Alberta Court of Appeal|accessdate=18 November 2016|location=Para. 30|language=English|date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These laws were enacted to recognize the inherent power imbalance between adults and children and that children are incapable of giving true consent to sexual acts with adults.  The laws protect children from undue influence, persuasion and manipulation.

In 2016, the Government of Turkey proposed legislation that would overturn a man conviction for child sex assault if they married their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=AFP in Turkey|title=Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry their victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-
marry-their-victims|accessdate=19 November 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 16, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consent===
Defence counsel may argue the victim consented to the sexual activity.  Determining if the victim consented can be problematic when the victim is intoxicated.  A [[Nova Scotia]] court found there was no sexual assault because the prosecution could not prove the sexual activity was non-consensual.  In that case, the sexual activity occurred in the back of a taxi cab between a taxi driver and an intoxicated customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael Gorman|title=Crown appeals acquittal in taxi sex assault case where judge said 'drunk can consent'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/sex-assault-taxi-drunk-1.4013364|accessdate=7 March 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 7, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cindy Gladue bled to death from an 11-centimetre cut in her vagina.  At trial, the accused said Ms. Gladue died after a night of consensual, rough sex in an Edmonton motel.  He was acquitted.  The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Chris Purdy |title=Supreme Court to hear questions in case of Ontario trucker acquitted in death of Edmonton woman |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/supreme-court-cindy-gladue-sexual-assault-1.4855218 |accessdate=13 October 2018 |agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=October 9, 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Rape shield laws===
In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government: ALRC: [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/20.%20Matters%20Outside%20the%20Uniform%20Evidence%20Acts/rape-shield-laws 20. Matters Outside the Uniform Evidence Acts - Rape shield laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and the United States, the prior sexual history of the victim is generally not admissible as evidence during a criminal proceeding.  These laws are referred to as [[rape shield laws]].

In Canada, the constitutionality of the [[rape shield law]] was challenged on the grounds that it hampers a defendant's ability to present a defence.  The law was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada: see ''[[R v Darrach]]''.

===Victim representation===
In Canadian criminal proceedings, the Crown prosecutor does not act on behalf of the victim and is not the victim's lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''29. Who represents the victim during the trial? Should I get a lawyer to ensure that my rights are met during the trial?'''&lt;br /&gt;
Crown counsel is not and can never function as the victim's lawyer. Although the Crown appears to be representing the interests of the victim, the Crown is the lawyer for the Queen and the government during the trial. In Canadian criminal cases, the harm is perceived to have been committed against the State. This is why cases are referred to as Regina v. Smith (or R. v. Smith), Regina being the Queen in Latin. The Crown is truly representing the society, of which you are a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other===
Sexual assault cases commonly involve multiple complainants.  In these cases, the defence is likely to apply for separate trials for each offence.
[[Joinder]] of multiple counts is only permitted in certain circumstances.

The decision to have separate trials is discretionary and is exercised in order to prevent prejudice to the defendant.  The threshold question for holding a joint trial is whether or not each complainant's evidence will be admissible in respect of the charges involving the other complainants (that is, whether such evidence is 'cross-admissible'). Decisions to hold separate trials or refuse to admit relevant tendency or propensity evidence about a defendant's sexual behaviour can be seen as barriers to the successful prosecution of sex offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Violence—A National Legal Response|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/26.%20Reporting%2C%20Prosecution%20and%20Pre-trial%20Processes/joint-or-separate-trial|publisher=Government of Australia - Law Reform Commission|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Section 26 - Joint or separate trial|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual assault charges against [[Jian Ghomeshi]] involved multiple complainants and were dealt with in two separate proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Gollom|title=Jian Ghomeshi found not guilty on choking and all sex assault charges|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jian-ghomeshi-sexual-assault-trial-ruling-1.3505446|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 24, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second trial did not proceed after Ghomeshi agreed to issue an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBC apologizes to Kathryn Borel over handling of Jian Ghomeshi complaint|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-apology-kathryn-borel-ghomeshi-peace-bond-1.3577223|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=May 11, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A victim of sexual assault may be subjected to speculative allegations of wrongdoing during [[cross-examination]].  For example, in ''R. v. Sofyan Boalag''&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v Sofyan Boalag|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlpc/doc/2016/2016nlpc113/2016nlpc113.html?resultIndex=3|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraph 105|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the defence lawyer asserted during the cross-examination that the victim was in fact asking for money in exchange for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rosie Mullaley|title='This man raped me'|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-13/article-4557844/%26lsquo%3BThis-man-raped-me%26rsquo%3B/1|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=The Telegram|date=June 13, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the accused was convicted of 13 criminal offences involving six victims including multiple sexual assaults at knife point.&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"/&gt;

A victim's alcohol consumption at the time of the assault may undermine the victim's ability to remember the assault and his or her ability to provide credible [[testimony]].  As noted by Justice Zuker of the Ontario Court of Justice: &lt;blockquote&gt;[414] What makes someone a perfect target in the context of alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults may make that person a poor witness in any ensuing proceedings due to his or her inability to remember part or all of what happened.  
[415] One of the more challenging (and ever-present) issues to evaluate in sexual assault is the question of [[consent]]. Sexual assaults may involve alcohol consumption by one or both parties. Frequently, parties to an incident will have limited or no memory of the events in question, and the court will be required to obtain and evaluate information provided by other witnesses or other corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice 2016 448|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Superior Court of Justice|accessdate=20 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 414 and 415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During cross examination a victim's attire may be scrutinized and they may be accused of wearing revealing clothing.  For example, a Toronto woman, who alleged she was sexually assaulted by three police officers after a party, was asked about her choice of wearing a top described as "really low cut with open sleeves" to a party mostly attended by "young men ... who would be drinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Trevor Dunn|title=Complainant denies defence's claim she wanted sex with Toronto officers accused of assaulting her|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/trial-tps-cross-examination-1.4151926|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=June 8, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[cross-examination]], a victim's criminal record may be noted in order to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] their [[Credible witness|credibility]]. This tactic was unsuccessfully used in the trial of [[Daniel Holtzclaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury convicts ex-Oklahoma cop Daniel Holtzclaw of rape, sodomy charges; faces life in prison|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/jury-convicts-ex-oklahoma-rape-charges-article-1.2462256|accessdate=10 October 2016|agency=Daily News|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse==
Victims of sexual assault are often subjected to [[social stigma]]. The victim may be subject to inappropriate post-assault behaviour or language by medical personnel or other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell R, Raja S |title=Secondary victimization of rape victims: insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence |journal=Violence Vict |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=261–75 |year=1999 |pmid=10606433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slut-shaming]] is the practice of [[victim blaming|blaming the victim]] for [[rape]] and other forms of [[sexual assault]].  It rests on the idea that sexual assault is caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex,&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for it: a first-hand account from slutwalk |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.

The [[SlutWalk]] challenges the idea of explaining or excusing rape by referring to any aspect of a woman's appearance.

In 2016, Indian politicians suggested that women's clothing choices could invite sexual assault.   The comments were made after a number of women were molested at a New Year's Eve party in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Amy Wang|title=Indian politicians cause outrage after blaming alleged groping on women's 'Western' clothes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/04/indian-politicians-cause-outrage-after-blaming-alleged-groping-on-womens-western-clothes/?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-in-the-news%3Apage%2Fin-the-news|accessdate=4 January 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=January 4, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the U.S. television program ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', [[Joy Behar]] referred to [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations|Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers]] as "[[Tramp#Tramp as promiscuous woman|tramps]]".

Sexual assault victims may stay away from work in order to avoid contact with the perpetrator.   For example, Caroline Lamarre, an office worker who was sexually assaulted at work, has not returned to work in order to avoid contact with her assailant.  The assailant was convicted of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convicted of sexual assault, Quebec mayor still presides while victim 'becomes the villain'|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/victim-becomes-the-villain-sexually-assaulted-by-quebec-mayor-woman-is-out-of-work-while-he-continues-to-preside|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=National Post|date=February 28, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may be subjected to [[cyberbullying]], as in the case of the [[suicide of Audrie Pott]], [[suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons]] and [[sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich]].

The [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Audrie &amp; Daisy]]'' is about two American high school students who were sexually assaulted by other students.  At the time they were assaulted, [[Audrie Pott]] was 15 and [[Daisy Coleman]] was 14 years old.  After the assaults, the victims and their families were subjected to abuse and [[cyberbullying]].

The movie ''[[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story]]'' is the true story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer, an Iowa resident who was raped in 1991.  Her story was groundbreaking because she spoke openly about her experiences including her interactions with hospital staff, the police, prosecutors, the accused, and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/2|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Des Moines Register won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] in 1991 for publishing the story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's sexual assault.  At the time the article was published it was unusual to publish the victim's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1991 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Public Service|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/des-moines-register|website=Pulitzer.ort|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ziegenmeyer wrote a book, ''Taking Back My Life'', to encourage women to seek help after they've been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Ziegenmeyer Interview|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/9927|website=CharlieRose.com|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, rape victims are at very high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. These acts may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.  In addition, the relatives of the victim may threaten the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/rape-victim-threatened-to-withdraw-case-in-up_694364.html |title=Rape victim threatened to withdraw case in UP |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2011-03-19 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |title=Stigmatization of Rape &amp; Honor Killings |publisher=WISE Muslim Women |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108041415/http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harter |first=Pascale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 |title=BBC News - Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-06-14|accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, girls and women who are raped are forced by their families to marry their rapist.  A [[arranged marriage|marriage is arranged]] because victims are deemed to have their "reputation" tarnished.  There is extreme [[social stigma]] related to being the victim of rape and the loss of [[virginity]].  Marriage is claimed to be advantageous for both the victim—who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status—and of the rapist, who avoids punishment.

In 2012, the [[Suicide of Amina Filali|suicide of a 16-year-old Moroccan girl]]—who, after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist at the suggestion of the prosecutor, and who subsequently endured abuse by the rapist after they married—sparked protests from activists against the law which allows the rapist to marry the victim in order to escape criminal sanctions, and against this social practice which is common in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |publisher=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the government of [[Turkey]] introduced legislation which would overturn a man's conviction for child sex assault if he married his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fury at Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-marry-their-victims|accessdate=27 December 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 22, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim support==
Victims often receive support from the community and other victims.  For example, when [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]] went public regarding her experience, "she was inundated with letters and phone calls of support, thanks and praise for her courage in going public. Many of the letters were from women who had been raped and had lived with their secrets, often telling no one, often blaming themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/3|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims' rights==
{{Main|Victims' rights}}

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'' report was published in response to allegations of sexual abuse made against English DJ and BBC Television presenter [[Jimmy Savile]].  The Director of Public Prosecutions described the report as marking a "watershed moment" and apologised for "shortcomings" in the handling of prior abuse claims. The report's publication resulted in some highlighting what could be systemic failure because of the number of complainants and institutions identified, but others criticised it for treating allegations as facts.

In the United States, the [[Crime Victims' Rights Act]] grants rights to victims including the right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  Similarly, in Canada the ''Canadian Victims Bill of Rights'' provides rights to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Victims Bill of Rights|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-23.7/index.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are victims' rights groups. [[Rise (non-governmental organization)|Rise]] is an NGO working to implement a bill of rights for sexual assault victims. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN) is an American group which carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and to ensure that rapists are brought to justice. The [[Victim Rights Law Center]] is an American non-profit organization that provides free legal services to victims of [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]]. In the United States, the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] works to administer justice and strengthen services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In South Africa, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) is a women's rights organisation that provides services and engages in advocacy to promote women's rights and improve women's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People Opposing Women Abuse website|url=http://www.powa.co.za/POWA/about-us/|accessdate=13 November 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe deposit boxes are generally located in [[bank]]s, [[post office]]s or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as [[gemstone]]s, [[precious metal]]s, [[currency]], marketable securities, [[Luxury goods]], important documents (e.g. [[Will (law)|will]]s, property [[deed]]s, or [[birth certificate]]s), or [[computer data storage|computer data]], that need protection from [[theft]], [[fire]], [[flood]], [[tampering (crime)|tampering]], or other perils. In the [[United States]], neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase [[insurance]] for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, fire, flooding or terrorist attacks.

Many [[hotel]]s, [[resort]]s and [[cruise ship]]s also offer safe deposit boxes or small safes to their patrons, for temporary use during their stay.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Kirby D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5323">'''Schizoanalysis''' ({{lang-fr|schizanalyse}}; ''schizo-'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σχίζειν ''skhizein'', meaning "to split") is a concept created by philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]] and first expounded in their book ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''. Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari.

In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari explains that "rather than moving in the direction of [[reductionism|reductionist]] modifications which simplify the complex", schizoanalysis "will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], in short towards its ontological [[heterogeneity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Guattari (1992, 61).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the idea==
Schizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]]—namely, the use of the [[Oedipus complex]] as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new "assemblages [''agencements''] of enunciation" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations.

By the time of "Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis" (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts, 1953–1974, MIT Press, 2004 (pp. 274--280), originally published in "Relazione di Gilles Deleuze" and discussions in Armando Verdiglione, ed., ''Psicanalisi e Politica; Atti del Convegno di studi tenuto a Milano l'8—9 Maggio 1973''. Milan: Feltrinelli, 1973, pp. 7-11, 17-21, 37-40, 44-45, 169-172. Abridged and edited&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze said "we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape".

==Components==
Schizoanalysis can be represented by four circular components that bud and form [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizomes]]:&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 160-2).&lt;/ref&gt;

# The generative component: the study of concrete mixed [[semiotics]]; their mixtures and variations. Making a tracing of the mixed semiotics.
# The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. Making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings.
# The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. Making the diagram of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective [[emergence]]s.
# The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. Outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations.

Schizoanalysis also proposes a novel take on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari, [[Anti-Oedipus]] (1972, 351-352 and 381), &lt;/ref&gt; inasmuch as it concerns an analysis of the "''n'' sexes" of a subject.

== Background ==
Angerer was director of Quantmeyer &amp; Eicke, of Kronenstrasse 61, Berlin, importers of rugs, furniture and works of art. In art matters he was second only to [[Walter Hofer]] in importance to Göring.&lt;ref name=looted /&gt; Angerer used his international contacts to find art for the Göring collection and arranged the sale of the modern works that Göring did not want, thus raising funds to buy the tapestries and old master works that Göring preferred.&lt;ref name=Petr79 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; Although he had strong Nazi connections, Angerer held no official position within the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, 1996, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Degenerate art" ==
The Nazis regarded any art that did not fit with their ideas of what art should be as [[Degenerate art]]. Almost all modern art was regarded as "degenerate". It was banned under the regime, seized and placed in special storehouses, and the artists who produced it were subject to sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10077|title="Entartete Kunst", Art Terms|publisher=www.moma.org|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/conspiracies-swirl-in-1939-nazi-art-burning/a-17510022 "Conspiracies swirl in 1939 Nazi art burning."] Daniela Späth/ lbh, ''DW'', 20 March 2014. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Göring removed 13 paintings from the store of seized "degenerate art" at Kopenickerstrasse. Among others, works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and Vincent van Gogh that he sold through Angerer. German-born Dutch national Franz Koenig&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-135521688 "Rogues' Gallery,"] Godfrey Barker, ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', 26 August 2005. questia.com Retrieved 3 December 2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh's]] ''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'' (first version, 1890)&lt;ref&gt;Originally at the Frankfurt Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;Originally at the [[Sanssouci palace|Palace of Sanssouci]] at Potsdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''The Quarry'' (c. 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Originally at Essen.&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig died in 1941 when he fell under a train at Cologne station.  According to  Ivan Lindsay, Koenig was killed by the Nazis, so his collection of [[Old Masters|old master]] drawings could be taken from him. Of the remaining paintings, one by [[Edward Munch]] and one by [[Paul Signac]] were sold by Angerer in Sweden and two further Munchs in London. Göring paid compensation to the [[Städel Museum]] for the Van Gogh and the [[Folkwang Museum]] for the Cézanne but at a fraction of the paintings true worth.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite book|author=Lindsay, Ivan.|title=The History of Loot and Stolen Art: from Antiquity until the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8G7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT413|year=2014|publisher=Andrews UK|location=London|isbn=978-1-906509-56-9|pages=413–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gifts for Hitler ==
Top Nazis liked to give each other gifts of art. When Göring desired to give [[Adolf Hitler]] a gift, he asked Angerer to buy eight Flemish [[Tapestry|tapestries]] from [[Albert Auwercx]]'s series of ''"Gothic Myths"'',&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; as the Nazis called these allegorical subjects. Göring's own deals could be mixed into such transactions in order to disguise them.&lt;ref name=Petr79&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mjQO61bvE7gC&amp;pg=PA79 Petropoulos, 1996, pp. 79-80.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities in Italy ==
Angerer was asked by Göring to buy six [[Tapestry|tapestries]] in Italy for 400,000 Lire.&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; He took a dozen to Göring in Berlin in August 1941 of which Göring bought six.{{fact|date=December 2015}} On a trip to Florence, around 1942, Angerer and the local German consul [[Gerhard Wolf]] went on a tour of [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi|Count Bonacossi]]'s collection. Angerer supposedly told the count, "What a pity you're not a Jew!" and drawing a finger across his throat continued "If you were a Jew, we could do just that! And all the paintings would be ours!" Forewarned of a German art raid, local collections had already removed their best items and hidden them elsewhere behind false walls. Records had been falsified and the remaining works spaced out to disguise the absences. Enquirers after the Jewish art historian [[Bernard Berenson]]'s collection were told that he had fled to Portugal with the help of the Vatican and that nothing of importance remained in Florence. In fact, he was still in Italy, awaiting the Allied liberation.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuels, Ernest &amp; Jayne Samuels.|title=Bernard Berenson, the Making of a Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzdlbNBUsJsC&amp;pg=PA478|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-06779-0|pages=478-479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post war ==
Angerer was interrogated by the Allies in the Autumn of 1945. He was placed under arrest and his home at [[Berchtesgaden]], which he had shared with [[Fritz Görnnert]] (Göring's personal assistant), was searched.&lt;ref&gt;Angerer had occupied the ground floor and Görnnert and his wife the two upper storeys.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carr Howe Jr.]], one of the U.S. "monuments men" charged with recovering looted art, described what he found there:

"The house was an unpretentious villa hidden among pine trees high up in the hills above the town. The place was under guard. On the ground floor we examined the contents of a small storeroom. There were several cases bearing Angerer's name and three or four large crates containing Italian furniture. A similar storeroom on the second floor contained a dozen tapestries, a pile of Oriental rugs, a large collection of church vestments and nearly a hundred rare textiles mounted on cardboard. … Concealed beneath the tapestries were ten cases, each one about two feet square and a foot high... On each one was stenciled in Gothic letters: "Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring." They contained a magnificent collection of Oriental weapons."&lt;ref&gt;Howe Jr, Thomas Carr. (1946) ''[https://www.questia.com/read/228577 Salt Mines and Castles: The Discovery and Restitution of Looted European Art]''. Indianapolis: [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]], pp. 219-220. questia.com Retrieved 21 December 2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Angerer was placed on the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] special counterintelligence [[X-2 Counter Espionage Branch#Special units|Art Looting Investigation Unit]]'s [[Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index | "red flag" list]] of people and organisations that were involved in the art trade under the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name=looted&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MVI3RM469661 Post-War Reports: Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945–1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index.] lootedart.com Retrieved 27 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His life after that is unclear.

The '''Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition''' ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the '''Spanish Inquisition''' (''Inquisición española''), was established in 1478 by [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]. It was intended to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the [[Medieval Inquisition]], which was under [[Pope|Papal control]]. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Roman Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. The "Spanish Inquisition" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and all Spanish possessions in [[Spanish America|North, Central, and South America]]. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three centuries of duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.

The Inquisition was originally intended primarily to identify [[heretics]] among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. The regulation of the faith of newly converted Catholics was intensified after the [[Alhambra Decree|royal decrees]] issued in 1492 and 1502 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave [[Crown of Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref name="Prien2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans-Jürgen Prien|title=Christianity in Latin America: Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSAbYoBGmxQC|date=21 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22262-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], after a period of declining influence in the preceding century.

The Spanish Inquisition is often cited in popular literature and history as an example of religious intolerance and repression. However, some historians have come to conclude that many of the charges levied against the Inquisition are exaggerated, and are a result of the [[Black Legend#The Spanish Black Legend|Black Legend]] produced by political and religious enemies of Spain, especially England.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Previous Inquisitions==
The [[Inquisition]] was created through [[papal bull]], ''[[Ad Abolendam]]'', issued at the end of the 12th century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to combat the [[Albigensian|Albigensian heresy]] in southern France. There were a large number of tribunals of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages through different diplomatic and political means. In the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition was established by the statute of ''Excommunicamus'' of Pope [[Gregory IX]], in 1232, during the era of the [[Albigensian]] heresy, as a condition for peace with Aragon. The Inquisition was ill-received by the Aragonese, which led to prohibitions against insults or attacks on it. Rome was particularly concerned about the 'heretical' influence of the Iberian peninsula's large Muslim and Jewish population on the Catholic. It pressed the kingdoms to accept the Papal Inquisition after Aragon. Navarra conceded in the 13th century and Portugal by the end of the 14th, however its 'Roman Inquisition' was famously inactive. Castile refused steadily, trusting on its prominent position in Europe and its military power to keep the Pope's interventionism in check. By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]], due to distance and voluntary compliance, and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (future part of Spain) due to resistance and power, were the only Western European kingdoms to successfully resist establishment of the Inquisition in their realms.

===Medieval Inquisition in Aragon===
Although [[Raymond of Penyafort]] was not an inquisitor, as a canon lawyer and the king's advisor, [[James I of Aragon]], had often consulted him on questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains.
"...[T]he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEfrDPxlraYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Raymond+of+Penyafort+%2B+inquisition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VZ5vbpyeWK&amp;sig=DNuuDEXkW1ypFlYVBrL5Ugb0P8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwxaWi7KPLAhXHw4MKHbH7Dx8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20of%20Penyafort%20%20%20inquisition&amp;f=false Smith, Damian J., ''Crusade, Heresy and Inquisition in the Lands of the Crown of Aragon'', Brill, 2010] {{ISBN|9789004182899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its early implantation, the Papal inquisition was greatly resisted within the crown of Aragon by both population and monarchs.
With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.

Regarding the living conditions of minorities, the kings of Aragon and other monarchies imposed some discriminatory taxation of religious minorities, so false conversions were a way of tax evasion.

In addition to said discriminatory legislation, Aragon had laws specifically targeted at protecting minorities. For example, crusades attacking Jewish or Muslim subjects of the King of Aragon while on their way to fight in the reconquest were punished with death by hanging. Up to the 14th century, the census and weddings records show an absolute lack of concern with avoiding intermarriage or blood mixture so present in other areas. Both the Roman Inquisition and neighbouring Christian powers showed discomfort with these two aspects of Aragonese law and lack of concern with ethnicity, but to little effect.
High-ranking officials of Jewish religion were not as common as in Castile, but were not unheard of either.&lt;ref&gt;Parrilla, Gonzalo Fernández, Miguel Hernando De Larramendi, and José Sangrador Gil.

(Thught and Idea Propagation across the Mediterranean: The Role of Translators) Cuenca: Servicio De Publicaciones De La Universidad De Castilla-La Mancha, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was said to have Jewish ancestry &lt;ref&gt;Cervera, César:  "La ascendencia judía del Rey Fernando «El Católico» y su primo el II Duque de Alba" ABC, 03/06/2015 08:34h https://www.abc.es/espana/20150602/abci-ascendencia-judia-fernando-catolico-201506011949.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Inquisition in Castile===

There was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], nor any inquisition during the Middle Ages. Members of the [[episcopate]] were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors, always under the direction of the king.

During the Middle Ages, in Castile, little to no attention was paid to heresy by the Catholic ruling class, or by the population. Castile didn´t see proliferation of anti-Jew pamphlets like England and France did during the 13th and 14th century, and those who have been found had modified, somehow watered down versions form the original stories&lt;ref&gt;Hassán, Iacob; Izquierdo Benito, Ricardo (2001). Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, ed. Judíos en la literatura española(Jews in Spanish Literature). España&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}. Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional customs in domestic matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The legislation regarding Muslims and Jews in Castilian territory varied greatly, becoming more intolerant during the period of great instability and dynastic wars that occurred by the end of the 14th century. The Castilian law is particularly difficult to summarize since due to the model of the free [[Royal Villas]] mayors and the population of border areas had the right to create their own [[fueros]] (law) that varied from one villa to the next. In general, the Castilian model was parallel to the initial model of Islamic Spain. Non-Catholics were subject to discriminatory legislation regarding taxation and some other specific discriminatory legislation-such as prohibition of wearing silk or "flashy clothes" &lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"&gt;Suárez Fernández, Luis (2012). La expulsión de los judíos. Un problema europeo. Barcelona: Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;- that varied from county to county, but were left alone besides that. Forced conversion of minorities was against the law, and so was the belief in the existence of witchcraft, oracles or similar superstitions. In general, all "people from the book" were permitted to practice their own customs and religions as far as they did not attempt proselytizing on the Christian population. Jews particularly had surprising freedoms and protections compared to other areas of Europe and were allowed to hold high public offices such as the counselor, treasurer or secretary for the crown.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During most of the medieval period intermarriage with converts was allowed and encouraged. The intellectual cooperation between religions was the norm in Castile. Some examples are the [[Toledo School of Translators]] from the 11th century. Jews and moriscos were allowed to hold high offices in the administration.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

A tightening of the laws to protect the right of Jews to collect loans during the Medieval Crisis, was one of the causes of the revolt against [[Peter the Cruel]] and catalyst of the anti-semitic episodes of 1490 in Castile, a kingdom that had shown no significant antisemitic backlash to the black death and drought crisis of the early 14th century. Even after the sudden increase in hostility towards other religions that the kingdom experienced after the 14th century crisis, which clearly worsened the living conditions of non-Catholics in Castile, it remained one of the most tolerant kingdoms in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, César Mantilla. Derecho De Los Judíos De Castilla En La Época De Su Expulsión(Legal Rights of Jews in Castile at the Time of their Expulsion). Valladolid: Maxtor, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

The kingdom had serious tensions with Rome regarding the Church's attempts to extend its authority into it. A focuss of conflict was Castilian resistance to truly abandon the [[mozarabic rite]], and the refusal to grant Papal control over Reconquest land (a request Aragon and Portugal conceded). These conflicts added up with a strong resistance to allow the creation of an Inquisition, and the kingdom´s general willingness to accept the heretics that came in seeking refuge from prosecution in France.

==Creation of the Spanish Inquisition==
There are several hypotheses of what prompted the creation of the tribunal after [[La Convivencia|centuries of outstanding tolerance]] (within the context of medieval Europe). The truth is probably a combination of varieties of them.

===The "Too Multi-Religious" hypothesis===
The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) can be interpreted as a response to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society following the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Muslim [[Moors]]. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]] and [[Barcelona]], had significant Jewish populations centered in [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Juderia]], but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by alienation and torture.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Post-reconquest medieval Spain has been characterized by [[Americo Castro]] as a society of relatively peaceful co-existence (''convivencia'') punctuated by occasional conflict among the ruling Catholics and the Jews and Muslims. However, as historian Henry Kamen notes, the "so-called convivencia was always a relationship between unequals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the crown of Aragon and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political. Castile itself had an unofficial [[rabbi]]. Ferdinand's father [[John II of Castile|John II]] named the Jewish [[Abiathar Crescas]] to be Court [[Astronomer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Antisemitic]] attitudes increased all over Europe during the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century. England and France expelled their [[Jewish]] populations in 1290 and 1306 respectively.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=79}}  At the same time, during the [[Reconquista]], Spain's anti-Jewish sentiment steadily increased. This prejudice climaxed in the summer of 1391 when violent anti-Jewish riots broke out in Spanish cities like [[Barcelona]]{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=82}}  To linguistically distinguish them from non-converted or long-established Catholic families, new converts were called [[conversos]], or New Catholics.

According to Don [[Hasdai Crescas]], persecution against Jews began in earnest in [[Seville]] in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June).&lt;ref name="Crescas"&gt;Letter of Hasdai Crescas, ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' by [[Solomon ibn Verga]] (ed.

See pages 138 – 140 in PDF (Hebrew); Fritz Kobler, ''Letters of the Jews through the Ages'', London 1952, pp. 272–75.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the violence had spread to [[Majorca]] and by the 1st day of the lunar month Elul it had also reached the Jews of [[Barcelona]] in [[Catalonia]], where the slain were estimated at two-hundred and fifty. So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of [[Province of Lleida|Lérida]] and Gironda and in the kingdom of  [[Valencia, Spain|València]] had been affected,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon ibn Verga]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/39487 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' (The Sceptre of Judah)], Lvov 1846, pp. 41 (end) – 42 in PDF); {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=17}}. Kamen cites approximate numbers for Valencia (250) and Barcelona (400), but no solid data about Córdoba.&lt;/ref&gt; as were also the Jews of [[Al-Andalus]] (Andalucía),&lt;ref&gt;According to Gedaliah Ibn Yechia, these disturbances were caused by a malicious report spread about the Jews. See: [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah Ibn Yechia]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. רסח, in PDF p. 277 (top) (Hebrew); Solomon ibn Verga, ''Shevat Yehudah'', Lvov 1846 (p. 76 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas many died a martyr’s death, while others converted in order to save themselves.

Encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]], the general unrest affected nearly all of the Jews in Spain, during which time an estimated 200,000 Jews changed their religion or else concealed their religion, becoming known in Hebrew as "Anūsim",&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Zacuto]], ''Sefer Yuchasin'', [[Cracow]] 1580 (q.v. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/11550 ''Sefer Yuchasin''], p. 266 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, "those who are compelled [to hide their religion]." Only a handful of the more principal persons of the Jewish community managed to escape, who had found refuge among the viceroys in the outlying towns and districts.&lt;ref name="Crescas" /&gt;

Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond of Peñafort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the public violence, many of the converted "felt it safer to remain in their new religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''. Many ''conversos'', now freed from the anti-Semitic restrictions imposed on Jewish employment, attained important positions in fifteenth century Spain, including positions in the government and in the Church. Among many others, physicians [[Andrés Laguna]] and Francisco Lopez Villalobos (Ferdinand's court physician), writers [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Juan de Mena]], [[Diego de Valera]] and [[Alonso de Palencia]], and bankers [[Luis de Santangel]] and Gabriel Sanchez (who financed the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]]) were all ''conversos''. ''Conversos'' – not without opposition – managed to attain high positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, at times becoming severe detractors of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Notably Bishop [[Pablo de Santa Maria]], author of ''Scrutinium Scripturarum'', [[Jeronimo de Santa Fe]] (''Hebraomastix'') and [[Pedro de la Caballeria]] (''Zelus Christi contra Judaeos''). All three were ''conversos''. ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=39}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Some even received titles of nobility, and as a result, during the following century some works attempted to demonstrate that virtually all of the nobles of Spain were descended from Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Notably the ''Libro verde de Aragon'' and ''Tizón de la nobleza de España'' (cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=38}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Enforcement Across Borders" hypothesis===
According to this hypothesis, the Inquisition was created to standardize the variety of laws and many jurisdictions Spain was divided into. It would be an administrative program analogous to the [[Santa Hermandad]] (the "Holy Brotherhood", a law enforcement body, answering to the crown, that prosecuted thieves and criminals across counties in a way local county authorities could not, ancestor to the [[Guardia Civil]]), an institution that would guarantee uniform prosecution of crimes against royal laws across all local jurisdictions.

The Kingdom of Castile had been prosperous and successful in Europe thanks in part to the unusual authority and control the king exerted over the nobility, which ensured political stability and kept the kingdom from being weakened by in-fighting (as was the case in England, for example). However, under the [[Trastamara]] dynasty, both the kings of Castile and Aragon had lost power to the great nobles, who now formed dissenting and conspiratorial factions. Taxation and varying privileges differed from county to county, and powerful noble families constantly extorted the kings to attain further concessions, particularly in Aragon.

The main goals of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs were to strengthen royal power to guarantee stability, and to unite their two kingdoms. In this, they sought to further unify the laws of their realms and reduce the power of the nobility in certain local areas. They attained this partially by raw military strength, by creating a combined army between the two of them that could outmatch the army of most noble coalitions in the Peninsula. However, it was impossible to change the entire laws of both realms by force alone, and due to reasonable suspicion of one another, the monarchs kept their kingdoms separate during their lifetimes. The only way to unify both kingdoms and ensure that Isabella, Ferdinand, and their descendants maintained the power of both kingdoms without uniting them in life was to find, or create, an executive, legislative and judicial arm directly under the Crown empowered to act in both kingdoms. This goal, the hypothesis goes, might have given birth to the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History. Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious organization to oversee this role was obvious: Catholicism was the only institution common to both kingdoms, and the only one with enough popular support that the nobility could not easily attack it. Through the Spanish Inquisition, Isabella and Ferdinand created a personal police force and personal code of law that rested above the structure of their respective realms without altering it or mixing them, and that could operate freely in both. As the Inquisition had the backing of both kingdoms, it would exist independent of both the nobility and local interests of either kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2012) [2009]. Breve Historia de la Inquisición en España. Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|978-84-08-00695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the prosecution of heretics would be secondary, or simply not considered different at the time from the prosecution of conspirators, traitors, or groups of any kind who planned to resist royal authority. At the time, royal authority rested on divine right and on oaths of loyalty held before God, so the connection between religious deviation and political disloyalty would appear obvious. This hypothesis is supported by the disproportionately high representation of the nobility and high clergy among those investigated by the Inquisition, as well as by the many administrative and civil crimes the inquisition prosecuted. The Inquisition prosecuted the counterfeiting of royal seals and currency, ensured the effective transmission of the orders of the kings, and verified the authenticity of official documents traveling through the kingdoms, especially from one kingdom to the other. See "Non-Religious Crimes".&lt;ref&gt;Canessa De Sanguinetti, Marta. El Bien Nacer: Limpieza De Oficios Y Limpieza De Sangre : Raíces Ibéricas De Un Mal Latinoamericano.

===The "Placate Europe" hypothesis===

At a time in which most of Europe had already [[History of the Jews in the Middle Ages|expelled the Jews from the Christian kingdoms]] the "dirty blood" of Spaniards was met with open suspicion and contempt by the rest of Europe. As the world became smaller and foreign relations became more relevant to stay in power this foreign image of "being the seed of jews and moors" may have become a problem. In addition, the coup that allowed Isabella to take the throne from [[Joana of Portugal|Joana of Avis]] and the Catholic Monarchs to marry had estranged Castile from Portugal, its historical ally, and created the need for new relationships. Similarly, Aragon's ambitions lay in control of the Mediterranean and the defence against France. As their [[Catholic Monarchs|policy of royal marriages]] proved, the Catholic Monarchs were deeply concerned about France's growing power and expected to create strong dynastic alliances across Europe. In this scenario, the Iberian reputation of being too tolerant was a problem. 
Despite the prestige earned through the reconquest ([[reconquista]]) that foreign image on Spaniards coexisted with an almost universal image of heretics and "bad Christians" due to the long coexistence between the three religions, they had accepted in their lands. Anti-Jews stereotypes created to justify or prompt the expulsion and expropriation of the European Jews were also applied to Spaniards in most European courts, and the idea of them being "greedy, gold-thirsty, cruel and violent", "like Jews", due to the "Jewish and Moorish blood" was prevalent in Europe before America was discovered by Europeans. Chronicles by foreign travelers circulated through Europe, describing the tolerant ambiance reigning in the court of Isabela and Ferdinand and how Moors and Jews were free to go about without anyone trying to convert them. Past and common clashes between the Pope and the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, regarding the Inquisition in Castile's case and regarding South Italy in Aragon's case, also reinforced their image of heretics in the international courts. These accusations and image could have direct political and military consequences at the time, especially considering that the union two powerful kingdoms were a particularly delicate moment that could prompt the fear and violent reactions from neighbors, even more, if combined with the expansion of the Ottoman Turks on the Mediterranean.
The creation of the Inquisition and the expulsion of both Jews and Moriscos may have been part of a strategy to whitewash the image of Spain and ease international fears regarding Spain's allegiance. In this scenario, the creation of the Inquisition could have been part of the catholic's Monarch strategy to " turn" away from African allies and "towards" Europe, a tool to turn both actual Spain and Spanish image more European and improve relations with the Pope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Ottoman Scare" hypothesis===

No matter if any of the previous hypotheses were already operating in the minds of the monarchs, the alleged discovery of Morisco plots to support a possible Ottoman invasion were crucial factors in their decision to create the Inquisition.

At this time, the Ottoman Empire was in expansion and making its power noticeable in the Mediterranean and North Africa. At the same time, the Aragonese Mediterranean Empire was crumbling under debt and war exhaustion. Ferdinand reasonably feared that he would not be capable of repelling an Ottoman attack to Spain's shores, especially if the Ottomans had internal help. The regions with the highest concentration of Moriscos were those close to the common naval crossings between Spain and Africa. If the weakness of the Aragonese Naval Empire was combined with the resentment of the higher nobility against the monarchs, the dynastic [[War of the Castilian Succession|claims of Portugal on Castile]] and the two monarch's exterior politic that turned away from Morocco and other African nations in favor of Europe, the fear of a second Muslim invasion - and thus a second Muslim occupation was hardly unfounded. This fear may have been the base reason for the expulsion of those citizens who had either a religious reason to support the invasion of the Ottomans (Moriscos) or no particular religious reason to not do it (Jews). The Inquisition might have been part of the preparations to enforce these measures and ensure their effectiveness by rooting out false converts that would still pose a threat of foreign espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Abou Al Fadl, K. (1994). Islamic law and Muslim minorities: the juristic discourse on Muslim minorities from the second/eight to the eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Islamic Law and Society, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosenes, A. (1997). Les inquisitions modernes dans les Pays-Bas meridionaux. 1520-1633. 2 vols. Bruselas&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of this view there is the obvious military sense it makes, and the many early attempts of peaceful conversion and persuasion that the Monarchs used at the beginning of their reign, and the sudden turn towards the creation of the Inquisition and the edicts of expulsion when those initial attempts failed. The [[History of Naples|conquest of Naples]] by the [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|Gran Capitan]] is also proof of an interest in Mediterranean expansion and re-establishment of Spanish power in that sea that was bound to generate frictions with the Ottoman Empire and other African nations. So, the Inquisition would have been created as a permanent body to prevent the existence of citizens with religious sympathies with African nations now that rivalry with them had been deemed unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Boronat, P. (1901). Los moriscos españoles y su expulsión. 2 vols. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical and Religious Reasons===

The creation of the Spanish Inquisition would be consistent with the most important political philosophers of the [[Florentine School]], with whom the kings were known to have contact ([[Guicciardini]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Machiavelli]], Segni, Pitti, Nardi, Varchi…). Both Guicciardini and Machiavelli defended the importance of centralization and unification in order to create a strong state capable of repelling foreign invasions, and also warned of the dangers of excessive social uniformity to the creativity and innovation of a nation. Machiavelli considered piety and morals desirable for the subjects but not so much for the ruler, whom should use them as a way to unify its population. He also warned of the nefarious influence of a corrupt church in the creation of a selfish population and middle nobility,  which had fragmented the peninsula and made it unable to resist either France or Aragon. German philosophers at the time were spreading the importance of a vassal to share the religion of their lord.

The Inquisition may have just been the result of putting these ideas into practice. The use of religion as a unifying factor across a land that was allowed to stay diverse and maintain different laws in other respects, and the creation of the Inquisition to enforce laws across it, maintain said religious unity and control the local elites were consistent with most of those teachings.

Alternatively, the enforcement of Catholicism across the realm might indeed be the result of simple religious devotion or a belief in a mystic religious ditty by the monarchs. The recent scholarship on the expulsion of the Jews leans towards the belief of religious motivations being at the bottom of it.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Nancy Rubin. Isabella of Castile: The First Renaissance Queen. New York: ASJA Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the reports on Ferdinand's political persona that is unlikely to be the only reason. Ferdinand was described, among others, by Machiavelli, as "a man who didn't know the meaning of piety, but who made political use of it and would had achieved little if he had really known it." He was Machiavelli's main inspiration while writing [[The Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Robert. Machiavelli. Abigdon, Oxon: Routledge, Tylor &amp;, 2013. pp83-120 (the quote is paraphrased)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Keeping the Pope in Check" hypothesis===

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had made many attempts during the Middle Ages to take over Christian Spain politically, such as claiming the Church's ownership over all land reconquered from non Christians (a claim that was rejected by Castille but accepted by Aragon and Portugal). In the past, the papacy had tried and partially succeeded, in forcing out of Iberia the [[mozarabic rite]]. Its meddling attempts had been pivotal for [[Albigensian crusade|Aragon's lose of Rosellon]]. The [[Crusade of Aragon|meddling regarding Aragon's control over South Italy]] was even stronger historically. In their lifetime, the Catholic Monarchs had [[Carrillo de Acuña|problems with]] [[Pope Paul II]], a very strong proponent of absolute authority of the church over the Kings. Carrillo actively opposed them both and often used Spain's "mixed blood" as an excuse to intervene. The papacy and the monarch of Europe had been involved in a  [[Investiture controversy|war for power all through the high Middle Ages]] that Rome had already won in other powerful kingdoms like [[France]].
Since the legitimacy granted by the church was necessary both, especially Isabella, to stay in power, the creation of the Spanish Inquisition may have been a way to apparently concede to the Pope's demands and criticism regarding Spain's mixed religious heritage, while at the same time ensuring that the Pope could hardly force the second inquisition of his own, and at the same time create a tool to control the power of the Roman Church in Spain.
The Spanish Inquisition was unique at the time because it did not depend on the Pope in the slightest. Once the bull of creation was granted the head of the inquisition was the Monarch of Spain. It was in charge of enforcing the laws of the king regarding religion and other private-life matters, not of following orders from Rome, from which was independent. This independence allowed the Inquisition to investigate, prosecute and convict clergy for both corruptions ([[pedophilia]], forgery of documents..) and possible charges of treason of conspiracy against the crown (on the Pope's behalf presumably) without the Pope's intervention. The inquisition was, despite of its title of "Holy", not formed necessarily by clergy but secular lawyers were equally welcome to it. If it was an attempt at keeping Rome out of Spain, it was an extremely successful and refined one. It was a bureaucratic body which had the nominal authority of the church and permission to prosecute members of the church, which the kings couldn't do while responding only to the Spanish Crown. This did not prevent the Pope from having influence on the decisions of Spanish monarchs of course, but it forced the influence to be through the kings and made direct influence very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;El Rey Y El Papa: Política Y Diplomacia En Los Albores Del Renacimiento (Castilla En El Siglo Xv) Óscar González - Sílex - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other hypotheses===
Other hypotheses that circulate regarding the Spanish Inquisition's creation include:
*'''Economic reasons''': Since one of the penalties that the inquisition could enforce on the convicts was the confiscation of their property, which became Crown property, it has been stated that the creation of the Inquisition was a way to finance the crown. There is no solid reason for this hypothesis to stand alone, nor for the Kings of Spain to need an institution to do this gradually instead of confiscating property through edicts, but it may be one of the reasons why the Inquisition stayed for so long. This hypothesis notices the tendency of the Inquisition to operate in large and wealthy cities and is favoured for those who consider that most of those prosecuted for practising Judaism and Islam in secret were actually innocent of it.&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"&gt;The Marranos of Spain. From the late XIVth to the early XVIth Century, 1966. Ithaca, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gustav Bergenroth]] editor and translator of the Spanish state papers 1485-1509 believed that revenue was the incentive for Ferdinand and Isabella's decision to invite the Inquisition into Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol1/i-lxxiii Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 1, 1485-1509; intro.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors point out that both monarchs were very aware of the economic backlash they would suffer from such decrease in population.
*'''Intolerance and racism''': This argument is usually made regarding the expulsion of the Jews or the Moriscos,&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"/&gt; and since the Inquisition was so closely interconnected with those actions can be expanded to it. It varies between those who deny that Spain was really that different to the rest of Europe regarding tolerance and openmindedness, and those who argue that it used to be but gradually the antisemitic and racism atmosphere of medieval Europe rubbed onto it. It explains the creation of the Inquisition as the result of exactly the same forces than the creation of similar entities across Europe. This view may account for the similarities between the Spanish Inquisition and similar institutions but completely fails to account for its many unique characteristics, including its time of appearance and its duration through time, so even if accepted requires the addition of some of the other hypothesis to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History
Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Purely religious reasons''': essentially this view suggests that the Catholic Monarchs created the Inquisition to prosecute heretics and sodomites "because the Bible says so". A common criticism that this view receives is that the Bible also condemns greed, hypocrisy, and adultery, but the Inquisition was not in charge of prosecuting any of those things. It also did not prosecute those who did not go to mass on Sunday or otherwise broke the Catholic rituals as far as it was out of simple laziness. Considering this double standard, its role was probably more complex and specific.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Activity of the Inquisition==

===Start of the Inquisition===
Fray Alonso de Ojeda, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar from Seville, convinced [[Queen Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of the existence of [[Crypto-Judaism]] among [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] ''[[conversos]]'' during her stay in [[Seville]] between 1477 and 1478.&lt;ref&gt;The terms ''converso'' and crypto-Jew are somewhat vexed, and occasionally historians are not clear on how, precisely, they are intended to be understood. For the purpose of clarity, in this article ''converso'' will be taken to mean one who has sincerely renounced Judaism or Islam and embraced Catholicism. Crypto-Jew will be taken to mean one who accepts Christian baptism, yet continues to practice Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt; A report, produced by [[Pedro González de Mendoza]], Archbishop of Seville, and by the Segovian Dominican [[Tomás de Torquemada]], corroborated this assertion.

Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] requested a [[papal bull]] establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478 in response to the ''conversos'' returning to the practice of Judaism. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=85}} In 1483, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar [[Tomás de Torquemada]] acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in [[Aragon]] and its treatment of the ''conversos''. Torquemada eventually assumed the title of Inquisitor-General.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=89}}

[[Thomas F. Madden]] describes the world that formed medieval politics: "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, you read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the [[Code of Justinian]] made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madden: The Real Inquisition. National Review 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to [[Castile (Spain)|Castile]] to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a [[papal bull|bull]] to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it.  On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the [[Papal bull]], ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, [[Miguel de Morillo]] and [[Juan de San Martín]], were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in [[Medina del Campo]].

The first ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' was held in Seville on 6 February 1481: six people were burned alive. From there, the Inquisition grew rapidly in the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Segovia]], [[Sigüenza]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Valladolid]]. Sixtus IV promulgated a new [[papal bull|bull]] categorically prohibiting the Inquisition's extension to [[Aragón]], affirming that:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | ... many true and faithful Christians, because of the testimony of enemies, rivals, slaves and other low people—and still less appropriate—without tests of any kind, have been locked up in secular prisons, tortured and condemned like relapsed heretics, deprived of their goods and properties, and given over to the [[secular arm]] to be executed, at great danger to their souls, giving a pernicious example and causing scandal to many. | Henry Kamen | The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision}}

According to the book ''A History of the Jewish People'',&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. 1976. p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | In 1482 the pope was still trying to maintain control over the Inquisition and to gain acceptance for his own attitude towards the [[New Christian]]s, which was generally more moderate than that of the Inquisition and the local rulers. | A History of the Jewish People}}

In 1483, Jews were expelled from all of [[Andalusia]]. Though the pope wanted to crack down on abuses, Ferdinand pressured him to promulgate a new bull, threatening that he would otherwise separate the Inquisition from Church authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Mathew|Archbishop Arnold H. Mathew]], ''The Life and Times of Rodrigo Borgia'', p. 52-53. Quote: "Isabella's Confessor, [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]], had imbued her with the idea that the suppression of all heresy within her realms was a sacred duty. She had, therefore, in November 1478, obtained a bull from the Pope, Sixtus IV., for the establishment of the Inquisition in Castile. Many modern writers have sought to reduce her share in the introduction of this terrible institution, but it must be remembered that Isabella herself probably considered it a meritorious action to punish with inhuman barbarity those whom she looked upon as the enemies of the Almighty. In 1480, two Dominicans were appointed by her, as Inquisitors, to set up their tribunal at Seville. Before the end of the year 1481, 2,000 victims were burned alive in Andalusia alone. The Pope himself became alarmed and threatened to withdraw the bull, but Ferdinand intimated that he would make the Inquisition altogether an independent tribunal. This it became later for all practical purposes, and its iniquitous proceedings continued unchecked."&lt;/ref&gt; Sixtus did so on 17 October 1483, naming [[Tomás de Torquemada]] Inquisidor General of Aragón, Valencia, and [[Catalonia]].

Torquemada quickly established procedures for the Inquisition. A new court would be announced with a thirty-day grace period for confessions and the gathering of accusations by neighbors. Evidence that was used to identify a crypto-Jew included the absence of chimney smoke on Saturdays (a sign the family might secretly be honoring the Sabbath) or the buying of many vegetables before Passover or the purchase of meat from a converted butcher. The court employed [[Forced confession|physical torture to extract confessions]]. Crypto-Jews were allowed to confess and do penance, although those who relapsed were burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. A History of the Jewish People. Harvard University Press, 1976, pp. 588-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, Pope [[Innocent VIII]] attempted to allow appeals to Rome against the Inquisition, but Ferdinand in December 1484 and again in 1509 decreed death and confiscation for anyone trying to make use of such procedures without royal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Inquisition became the only institution that held authority across all the realms of the Spanish monarchy and, in all of them, a useful mechanism at the service of the crown. However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and even saw revolt, as in [[Teruel]] from 1484 to 1485. However, the murder of ''Inquisidor'' [[Pedro Arbués]] in [[Zaragoza]] on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the ''conversos'' and in favour of the Inquisition. In Aragón, the Inquisitorial courts were focused specifically on members of the powerful ''converso'' minority, ending their influence in the Aragonese administration.

The Inquisition was extremely active between 1480 and 1530. Different sources give different estimates of the number of trials and executions in this period; some estimate about 2,000 executions, based on the documentation of the ''autos-da-fé'', the great majority being ''conversos'' of Jewish origin. He offers striking statistics: 91.6% of those judged in Valencia between 1484 and 1530 and 99.3% of those judged in Barcelona between 1484 and 1505 were of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False conversions===

The Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. It had no power to investigate, prosecute, or convict Jews, Muslims, or any open member of other religion. Anyone who was known to identify as either Jew or Muslim was outside of Inquisitorial jurisdiction and could only be tried by the King. All the inquisition could do in some of those cases was to deport the individual according to the King's law, but usually, even that had to go through a Civil Tribunal. The Inquisition only had power to try those who self-identified as Christians (initially for taxation purposes, later to avoid deportation well) while practicing another religion de facto. Even those were treated as Christians. If they confessed or identified not as "judeizantes" but as fully practicing Jews, they fell back into the previously explained category and could not be targeted (they would have pleaded guilty to lying about being Christians previously though).

====Expulsion of Jews. Jewish ''conversos''====
[[File:An auto-da-fé of the Spanish Inquisition and the execution o Wellcome V0041892.jpg|thumb|Though not subject to the Inquisition, Jews who refused to convert or leave Spain were called heretics and could be burned to death on a stake]]
The Spanish Inquisition had been established in part to prevent ''conversos'' from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, they were supposed to have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of ''conversos'' was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for [[Antisemitism in Spain|formally expelling all Jews from Spain]] was the "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., ''conversos'') from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith", according to the 1492 edict.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alhambra Decree]], issued in January 1492, gave the choice between expulsion and conversion. It was among the few expulsion orders that allowed conversion as an alternative and is used as a proof of the religious, not racial, element of the measure. The enforcement of this decree was very unequal however, with the focus mainly on coastal and southern regions-those at risk of Ottoman invasion- and a more gradual and ineffective enforcement towards the interior.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;

Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000. While few reliable statistics exist for the expulsion, modern estimates based on tax returns and population estimates of communities are much lower, with Kamen stating that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 ''conversos'', about 40,000 emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (where the entire community was forcibly converted in 1497) and to North Africa. The Jews of the kingdom of Aragon fled to other Christian areas including Italy, rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of ''conversos'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murphy | first = Cullen | title = God's jury : the Inquisition and the making of the modern world | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | location = Boston | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-618-09156-0 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intense period of persecution of ''conversos'' lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of ''conversos'' among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in [[Quintanar de la Orden]] in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some ''conversos'' who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of ''[[autos-da-fé]]'' in [[Majorca]], 37 ''chuetas'', or ''conversos'' of Majorca, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. [[Manuel Santiago Vivar]], tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expulsion of the Moriscos and Morisco ''conversos''====
The Inquisition searched for false or relapsed converts among the [[Moriscos]], who had converted from [[Islam]]. Beginning with a decree on February 14, 1502, Muslims in Granada had to choose between conversion to Christianity or expulsion.&lt;ref name="Prien2012" /&gt; In the Crown of Aragon, most Muslims had faced this choice after the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] (1519–1523). It is important to note that the enforcement of the expulsion of the moriscos was enforced really unevenly, especially in the lands of the interior and the north, where the coexistence had lasted for over five centuries and moriscos were protected by the population, and orders were partially or completely ignored.

The [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71)|War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–71), a general Muslim/Morisco uprising in Granada that expected to aid an Ottoman disembarcation in the peninsula, ended in a forced dispersal of about half of the region's Moriscos throughout Castile and Andalusia as well as increased suspicions by Spanish authorities against this community.

Many Moriscos were suspected of practising Islam in secret, and the jealousy with which they guarded the privacy of their domestic life prevented the verification of this suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Scott: History, Vol II, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they were not severely persecuted by the Inquisition, experiencing instead a policy of evangelization&lt;ref&gt;Absent records, the Inquisition decreed that all Moors were to be regarded as baptized and thus were Moriscos subject to the Inquisition.  Secular authorities then decreed (in 1526) that 40 years of religious instruction would precede any prosecution.  Fifty Moriscos were burnt at the stake before the Crown clarified its position.  Neither the Church nor the Moriscos utilized the years well. The Moriscos can be stereotyped as poor, rural, uneducated agricultural workers who spoke Arabic.  The Church had limited willingness or ability to educate this now-hostile group.{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=124-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy not followed with those ''conversos'' who were suspected of being crypto-Jews. There were various reasons for this. In the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon a large number of the Moriscos were under the jurisdiction of the nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class. Most importantly, the moriscos had integrated in the Spanish society way better than the Jews, intermarrying with the population often, and were not seen as a foreign element, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor J. Dadson, The Assimilation of Spain’s Moriscos:
Fiction or Reality? Journal of Levantine Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, fears ran high among the population that the Moriscos were traitorous, especially in Granada. The coast was regularly raided by [[Barbary pirate]]s backed by Spain's enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.

In the second half of the century, late in the reign of Philip II, conditions worsened between [[Old Christians]] and Moriscos. The [[Morisco Revolt]] in Granada in 1568–1570 was harshly suppressed, and the Inquisition intensified its attention on the Moriscos. From 1570 Morisco cases became predominant in the tribunals of [[Zaragoza]], Valencia and Granada; in the tribunal of Granada, between 1560 and 1571, 82% of those accused were Moriscos, who were a vast majority of the Kingdom's population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the Moriscos did not experience the same harshness as judaizing ''conversos'' and Protestants, and the number of capital punishments was proportionally less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], upon the advice of his financial adviser the [[Duke of Lerma]] and Archbishop of Valencia [[Juan de Ribera]], decreed the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]]. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict required: 'The [[Moriscos]] to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange.... just what they could carry.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson.&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"&gt;Trevor J. Dadson:  [http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/villarrubiadelosojos/imagenes/Dadson_Assimilation_Reality_or_Fiction.pdf ''The Assimilation of Spain's Moriscos: Fiction or Reality?'']. Journal of Levantine Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

Of those permanently expelled, the majority finally settled in the Maghreb or the Barbary coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boase|first=Roger|date=4 April 2002|title=The Muslim Expulsion from Spain|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=52|issue=4|quote=The majority of those permanently expelled settling in the [[Maghreb]] or [[Barbary Coast]], especially in Oran, Tunis, Tlemcen, Tetuán, Rabat and Salé.

The Inquisition pursued some trials against Moriscos who remained or returned after expulsion: at the height of the Inquisition, cases against Moriscos are estimated to have constituted less than 10 percent of those judged by the Inquisition. Upon the coronation of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1621, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on remaining Moriscos and returnees. In September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos "unless they cause significant commotion." &lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CHMO/article/view/37358/36158 Michel Boeglin: ''La expulsión de los moriscos de Andalucía y sus límites. El caso de Sevilla (1610-1613)''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous practice of Islam is considered to have been effectively extinguished in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4040221 ''Vínculos Historia'': ''The Moriscos who remained. The permanence of Islamic origin population in Early Modern Spain: Kingdom of Granada, XVII-XVIII centuries''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Heretics===

The Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. As such, those who self-identified as Christians could be investigated and trialed by it. Those in the group of "heretics" were all subject to investigation. All forms of heretic Christianity (Protestants, Orthodox, blaspheming Catholics, etc.) were considered under its jurisdiction.

==== Protestants and Anglicans====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy]]
Despite popular myths about the Spanish Inquisition relating to Protestants, it dealt with very few cases involving actual Protestants, as there were so few in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]], is here not considered part of the Spanish Inquisition. Lutheran was a portmanteau accusation used by the Inquisition to act against all those who acted in a way that was offensive to the church. The first of the trials against those labeled by the Inquisition as "Lutheran" were those against the sect of [[mysticism|mystics]] known as the "[[Alumbrados]]" of [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] and [[Valladolid]]. The trials were long and ended with prison sentences of differing lengths, though none of the sect were executed. Nevertheless, the subject of the "Alumbrados" put the Inquisition on the trail of many intellectuals and clerics who, interested in [[Erasmian]] ideas, had strayed from orthodoxy. This is striking because both Charles I and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] were confessed admirers of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such{{clarify|being an intellectual or professing Erasmian ideas/and/or both?|date=June 2014}} was the case with the humanist [[Juan de Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was forced to flee to Italy to escape the process that had been begun against him, and the preacher, [[Juan de Ávila]], who spent close to a year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trials against [[Lutheran]] groups, as such, took place between 1558 and 1562, at the beginning of the reign of Philip II, against two communities of Protestants from the cities of Valladolid and Seville, numbering about 120.&lt;ref&gt;These trials, specifically those of Valladolid, form the basis of the plot of ''The Heretic: A novel of the Inquisition'' by Miguel Delibes (Overlook: 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The trials signaled a notable intensification of the Inquisition's activities. A number of ''[[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' were held, some of them presided over by members of the royal family, and around 100 executions took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=99}} gives the figure of about 100 executions for heresy of any kind between 1559 and 1566. He compares these figures with those condemned to death in other European countries during the same period, concluding that in similar periods England, under [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], executed about twice as many for heresy: in France, three times the number, and ten times as many in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''autos-da-fé'' of the mid-century virtually put an end to Spanish Protestantism, which was, throughout, a small phenomenon to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1562, though the trials continued, the repression was much reduced. About 200 Spaniards were accused of being Protestants in the last decades of the 16th century. &lt;blockquote&gt;Most of them were in no sense Protestants ... Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as "Lutheran." Disrespect to church images, and eating meat on forbidden days, were taken as signs of heresy...&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; It is estimated that a dozen Spaniards were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that Protestantism and Anglicanism were treated as a marker to identify agents of foreign powers and symptoms of political disloyalty as much, if not more, than as a cause of prosecution in itself. Religion, patriotism, obedience to the king and personal beliefs were not seen as separate aspects of life until the end of the Modern Age. Spain especially had a long tradition of using self-identified religion as a political and cultural marker, and expression of loyalty to a specific overlord, more than as an accurate description of personal beliefs -here the common accusation of heretics they received from Rome. In that note, accusations or prosecutions due to beliefs held by enemy countries must be seen as political accusations regarding political treason more than as religious ones. Other times the accusation of Protestantism was considered as an equivalent of blasphemy, just a general way of addressing insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Sala, Maria Luisa. Los PROTESTANTES Y LA INQUISICIÓN. UNAM. https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/6/2905/6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
Even though the Inquisition had theoretical permission to investigate Orthodox "heretics", it almost never did. There was no major war between Spain and any Orthodox nation, so there was no reason to do so. There was one casualty tortured by those "Jesuits" (though most likely, [[Franciscans]]) who administered the Spanish Inquisition in North America, according to authorities within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],:  St. [[Peter the Aleut]]. Even that single report has various numbers of inaccuracies that make it problematic, and has no confirmation in the Inquisitorial archives.

===Witchcraft and Superstition===
The category "superstitions" includes trials related to [[witchcraft]]. The [[witch-hunt]] in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany). One remarkable case was [[Logroño witch trials|that of Logroño]], in which the witches of [[Zugarramurdi]] in [[Navarre]] were persecuted. During the ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' that took place in [[Logroño]] on November 7 and November 8, 1610, six people were burned and another five burned in [[effigy]].&lt;ref&gt;These trials are the theme of the film ''Akelarre'', by the Spanish director Pedro Olea.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the inquisition in cases of witchcraft was much more restricted than is commonly believed. Well after the foundation of the inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis. [[Alonso Salazar Frias|Alonso de Salazar Frías]], who took the Edict of Faith to various parts of Navarre after the trials of Logroño, noted in his report to the Suprema that, "There were neither [[witches]] nor [[bewitched]] in a village until they were talked and written about".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Henningsen, Gustav, ed. The Salazar Documents: Inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías and Others on the Basque Witch Persecution. Vol 21, Cultures, Beliefs, and Traditions: Medieval and Early Modern Peoples. Boston: Koninklijke Brill, 2004. Second Report of Salazar to the Inquisitor General (Logroño, 24 March 1612): An account of the whole visitation and publication of the Edict with special reference to the witches' sect, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blasphemy====
Included under the rubric of ''heretical propositions'' were verbal offences, from outright [[blasphemy]] to questionable statements regarding religious beliefs, from issues of sexual morality to misbehaviour of the clergy. Many were brought to trial for affirming that ''simple fornication'' (sex between unmarried persons) was not a sin or for putting in doubt different aspects of [[Christian]] faith such as [[Transubstantiation]] or the virginity of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=223-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, members of the clergy itself were occasionally accused of heretical propositions. These offences rarely led to severe penalties.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Sodomy====
The first sodomite was burned by the Inquisition in Valencia in 1572, and those accused included 19% clergy, 6% nobles, 37% workers, 19% servants, and 18% soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did they have a chance to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy'', pp. 276-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that cases of sodomy did not receive the same treatment in all areas of Spain. In the Kingdom of Castile crimes of sodomy were not investigated by the Inquisition unless they were associated with religious heresy (In other words, the sodomy itself was investigated only as, and when, considered a symptom of a heretic belief or practice). In any other area cases were considered an issue of civil authorities, and even then was not very actively investigated. The Crown of Aragon was the only area in which they were considered under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction, probably due to the previous presence of the Pontifical Inquisition in that kingdom. Within the Crown of Aragon, the tribunal of the city of Zaragoza was famously harsh even at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. p. 192 pp259&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason to group "sodomy" with heresies and not with "marriage and family" is that sodomy was strongly associated with Islam, Judaism, Catharism, and heresy in general. It was seen as a symptom of them more than as a condition or peculiarity in itself.

====Freemasonry====
{{Further|Papal ban of Freemasonry|In eminenti apostolatus}}
The Catholic Church has regarded [[Freemasonry]] as heretical since about 1738; the ''suspicion'' of Freemasonry was potentially a capital offense. Spanish Inquisition records reveal two prosecutions in Spain and only a few more throughout the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Francisco Javier de Mier y Campillo]], the [[Inquisitor General]] of the Spanish Inquisition and the [[Bishop of Almería]], suppressed Freemasonry and denounced the lodges as "societies which lead to atheism, to sedition and to all errors and crimes."&lt;ref name="Denslow"&gt;William R. Denslow, [[Harry S. Truman]]: ''10,000 Famous Freemasons'', {{ISBN|1-4179-7579-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then instituted a purge during which [[Spaniards]] could be arrested on the charge of being "suspected of Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="Denslow" /&gt;

=== Censorship ===
[[File:Inquisition01.jpg|thumb|A 1508 woodcut of the Inquisition]]

As one manifestation of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Spanish Inquisition worked actively to impede the diffusion of heretical ideas in Spain by producing "Indexes" of prohibited books. Such lists of prohibited books were common in Europe a decade before the Inquisition published its first. The first Index published in Spain in 1551 was, in reality, a reprinting of the Index published by the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in 1550, with an appendix dedicated to Spanish texts. Subsequent Indexes were published in 1559, 1583, 1612, 1632, and 1640. The Indexes included an enormous number of books of all types, though special attention was dedicated to religious works, and, particularly, vernacular translations of the Bible.

Included in the Indices, at one point, were many of the great works of [[Spanish literature]]. Also, a number of religious writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published in the first place if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.

At first, inclusion in the Index meant total prohibition of a text; however, this proved not only impractical and unworkable, but also contrary to the goals of having a literate and well-educated clergy. Works with one line of suspect dogma would be prohibited in their entirety, despite the orthodoxy of the remainder of the text. In time, a compromise solution was adopted in which trusted Inquisition officials blotted out words, lines or whole passages of otherwise acceptable texts, thus allowing these expurgated editions to circulate. Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed. And Irving Leonard has conclusively demonstrated that, despite repeated royal prohibitions, romances of chivalry, such as ''[[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]]'', found their way to the New World with the blessing of the Inquisition. Moreover, with the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century, increasing numbers of licenses to possess and read prohibited texts were granted.

[[File:Scene from an Inquisition by Goya.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Inquisition Scene'' by [[Francisco Goya]]. The Spanish Inquisition was still in force in the late eighteenth century, but much reduced in power.]]
Despite the repeated publication of the Indexes and a large bureaucracy of censors, the activities of the Inquisition did not impede the development of Spanish literature's "Siglo de Oro", although almost all of its major authors crossed paths with the Holy Office at one point or another. Among the Spanish authors included in the Index are [[Bartolomé Torres Naharro]], [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Juan de Valdés]] and [[Lope de Vega]], as well as the anonymous ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and the ''[[Cancionero General]]'' by [[Hernando del Castillo]]. ''[[La Celestina]]'', which was not included in the Indexes of the [[16th century]], was expurgated in 1632 and prohibited in its entirety in 1790. Among the non-Spanish authors prohibited were [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Rabelais]], [[Ariosto]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Valentin Naboth#cite note-13|Valentine Naibod]] and [[Thomas More]] (known in Spain as Tomás Moro). One of the most outstanding and best-known cases in which the Inquisition directly confronted literary activity is that of [[Fray Luis de León]], noted humanist and religious writer of converso origin, who was imprisoned for four years (from 1572 to 1576) for having translated the [[Song of Songs]] directly from Hebrew.

Some scholars state that one of the main effects of the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: "Our country is a land of ... [[barbarian|barbarism]]; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of [[heresy]], error and [[Judaism]]. Thus silence was imposed on the learned."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For the next few centuries, while the rest of Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''A History of Christianity'', [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], [[London]] 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion is contested.

The [[censorship]] of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted [[scientist]]s, and relatively few scientific books were placed on the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent paradox gets explained by both the [[hermeticist]] religious ideas of the Spanish church and monarchy, and the budding seed of what would become [[Enlightened absolutism]] taking shape in Spain. The list of banned books was not, as interpreted sometimes, a list of evil books but a list of books that lay people were very likely to misinterpret. The presence of highly symbolical and high-quality literature in the list was so explained. These metaphorical or parable sounding books were listed as not meant for free circulation, but there might be no objections to the book itself and the circulation among scholars was mostly free. Most of this books were carefully collected by the elite. The practical totality of the prohibited books can be found now as then in the library of the [[monasterio del Escorial]], carefully collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The collection was "public" after Philip II's death and members of universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and certain branches of the nobility didn't have too many problems to access them and commission authorised copies. The Inquisition has not been known to make any serious attempt to stop this for all the books, but there are some records of them "suggesting" the King of Spain to stop collecting grimoires or magic related ones.
This attitude was also not new. Translations of the Bible to Castillian and Provenzal (Catalan) had been made and allowed in Spain since the Middle Ages. The first preserved copy dates from the 13th century. However, like [[Polyglot Bible|the bible of Cisneros]] they were mostly for scholarly use, and it was customary for laymen to ask religious or academic authorities to review the translation and supervise the use.

===Family and Marriage===

====Bigamy====
The Inquisition also pursued offenses against morals and general social order, at times in open conflict with the jurisdictions of civil tribunals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In particular, there were trials for [[bigamy]], a relatively frequent offence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a society that only permitted divorce under the most extreme circumstances.  In the case of men, the penalty was two hundred lashes and five to ten years of "service to the Crown". Said service could be whatever the court deemed most beneficial for the nation but it usually was either five years as an oarsman in a royal [[galley]] for those without any qualification&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly a death sentence),&lt;ref&gt;Statistics are not available for Spanish oarsmen, but the general state of Mediterranean oared galleys circa 1570 was grim.  "... galley slaves led lives bitter and short."  "One way or another the oared galley consumed men like fuel.  Each dying wretch dumped overboard had to be replaced - and there were never enough."{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Roger |title=Empires of the sea : the siege of Malta, the battle of Lepanto, and the contest for the center of the world |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8129-77646 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ten years working maintained but without salary in a public Hospital or charitable institution of the sort for those with some special skill, such as doctors, surgeons, or lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Arrazola, Lorenzo. Enciclopedia Espanola De Derecho Y Administracion: Ciu-col .. Madrid: Saraswati Press, 2012 pp 572(Enciclopedia of Spanish Penal and Administrative Law)&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty was five to seven years as an oarsman in the case of Portugal.

====Unnatural Marriage====

Under the category of "unnatural marriage" fell any marriage or attempted marriage between two individuals who could not procreate. The Catholic Church in general, and in particular a nation constantly at war like Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Estudios Sobre Cultura, Guerra Y Polt̕ica En La Corona De Castilla (siglos Xiv-xvii) (Studies Over War Culture and Politics in the Kingdom of Castile) Fernando Cc̀eres - Editorial Csic Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientf̕icas - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaler, Amy. Fertility, Gender and War: The "culture of Contraception". University of Minnesota, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the reproductive goal of marriage. The Spanish Inquisition's policy in this regard was restrictive but applied in a very egalitarian way. It considered unnatural any non-reproductive marriage, and natural any reproductive one, regardless of gender or sex involved. The two forms of obvious male sterility were either due to damage to the genitals through castration or accidental wounding at war (capón) or to some genetic condition that might keep the man from completing puberty (lampiño). Female sterility was also a reason to declare a marriage unnatural but was harder to prove. One of the most interesting cases to study the attitude of the Spanish Inquisition regarding marriage, sex, and gender is the trial of [[Eleno de Céspedes]].

===Non-religious Crimes===

Despite popular belief, the role of the Inquisition as a mainly religious institution, or religious in nature at all, is contested at best. Its main function was that of a private police for the Crown with jurisdiction to enforce the law in those crimes that took place in the private sphere of life. The notion of religion and civil law being separate is a modern construction and made no sense in the 15th century, so there was no difference between breaking a law regarding religion and breaking a law regarding tax collection. The difference between them is a modern projection the institution itself did not have.
As such, the Inquisition was the prosecutor (in some cases the only prosecutor) of any crimes that could be perpetrated without the public taking notice (mainly domestic crimes, crimes against the weakest members of society, administrative crimes and forgeries, organized crime, and crimes against the Crown).

Examples include crimes associated with sexual or family relations such as [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] (the Inquisition was the first and only body who punished it across the nation), [[bestiality]], [[pedophilia]] (often overlapping with sodomy), [[incest]], [[child abuse]] or [[child neglect|neglect]] and (as discussed) [[bigamy]]. Non-religious crimes also included [[procurement]] (not [[prostitution]]), [[human trafficking]], [[smuggling]], forgery or falsification of [[counterfeit currency|currency]], [[document forgery|documents]] or [[signature forgery|signatures]], tax [[fraud]] (many religious crimes were considered subdivisions of this one), [[illegal weapons]], [[wikt:swindle|swindle]]s, disrespect to the Crown or its institutions (the Inquisition included, but also the church, the guard, and the kings themselves), [[espionage]] for a foreign power, [[conspiracy]], [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/3241610 Online access to the Historical Archives of the Inquisition in Valencia], where the records of the trials and correspondence to officials can be found; you can find the corresponding ones to various other areas in Spain in the same webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The non-religious crimes processed by the Inquisition accounted for a considerable percentage of its total investigations and are often hard to separate in the statistics, even when documentation is available. The line between religious and non-religious crimes did not exist in 15th century Spain as legal concept. Many of the crimes listed here and some of the religious crimes listed in previous sections were contemplated under the same article. For example, "sodomy" included paedophilia as a subtype. Often part of the data given for prosecution of male homosexuality corresponds to convictions for paedophilia, not adult homosexuality. In other cases, religious and non-religious crimes were seen as distinct but equivalent. The treatment of public blasphemy and street swindlers was similar (since in both cases you are "misleading the public in a harmful way). Making counterfeit currency and heretic proselytism was also treated similarly; both of them were punished by death and subdivided in similar ways since both were "spreading falsifications". In general heresy and falsifications of material documents were treated similarly by the Spanish Inquisition, indicating that they may have been thought of as equivalent actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Another difficulty to discriminate the inquisition's secular and religious activity is the common association of certain types of investigations. An accusation or suspicion on certain crime often launched an automatic investigation on many others. Anyone accused of espionage due to non-religious reasons would likely be investigated for heresy too, and anyone suspected of a heresy associated to a foreign power would be investigated for espionage too automatically. Likewise, some religious crimes were considered likely to be associated with non-religious crimes, like human trafficking, procurement, and child abuse was expected to be associated to sodomy, or sodomy was expected to be associated to heresy and false conversions. Which accusation started the investigation isn't always clear.
Finally, trials were often further complicated by the attempts of witnesses or victims to add further charges, especially [[witchcraft]]. Like in the case of [[Eleno de Céspedes]], charges for witchcraft done in this way, or in general, were quickly dismissed but they often show in the statistics as investigations made.

== Organization ==
Beyond its role in religious affairs, the Inquisition was also an institution at the service of the monarchy. The Inquisitor General, in charge of the Holy Office, was designated by the crown. The Inquisitor General was the only public office whose authority stretched to all the kingdoms of Spain (including the American viceroyalties), except for a brief period (1507–1518) during which there were two Inquisitors General, one in the kingdom of Castile, and the other in [[Aragon]].

[[File:Auto de fe Lima.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza Mayor]] in [[Lima]], Viceroyalty of Peru, 17th century]]

The Inquisitor General presided over the Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition (generally abbreviated as "Council of the Suprema"), created in 1483, which was made up of six members named directly by the crown (the number of members of the Suprema varied over the course of the Inquisition's history, but it was never more than 10). Over time, the authority of the Suprema grew at the expense of the power of the Inquisitor General.

The Suprema met every morning, except for holidays, and for two hours in the afternoon on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The morning sessions were devoted to questions of faith, while the afternoons were reserved for "minor heresies"&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, Gustav: The Spanish Inquisition and the Inquisitorial Mind, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; cases of perceived unacceptable sexual behavior, [[bigamy]], [[witchcraft]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Suprema were the various tribunals of the Inquisition, which were originally itinerant, installing themselves where they were necessary to combat heresy, but later being established in fixed locations. During the first phase numerous tribunals were established, but the period after 1495 saw a marked tendency towards centralization.

In the kingdom of Castile, the following permanent tribunals of the Inquisition were established:
* 1482 In [[Seville]] and in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].
* 1485 In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and in [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]].
* 1488 In [[Valladolid]] and in [[Murcia]].
* 1489 In [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]].
* 1505 In [[Las Palmas]] ([[Canary Islands]]).
* 1512 In [[Logroño]].
* 1526 In [[Granada]].
* 1574 In [[Santiago de Compostela]].

There were only four tribunals in the kingdom of [[Aragon]]: [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (1482), [[Barcelona]] (1484), and [[Majorca]] (1488).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand the Catholic]] also established the Spanish Inquisition in [[Sicily]] (1513), housed in [[Palermo]], and [[Sardinia]], in the town of [[Sassari]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Sicily]], the Inquisition functioned until 30 March 1782, when it was abolished by King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples]]. It is estimated that 200 people were executed during this period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Americas, tribunals were established in [[Lima]] and in [[Mexico City]] (1569) and, in 1610, in [[Cartagena de Indias]] (present day [[Colombia]]).

==Composition of the tribunals==
[[File:Estructura de la Inquisición.svg|thumb|Structure of the Spanish Inquisition]]

Initially, each of the tribunals included two inquisitors, a ''calificador'' (qualifiers), an ''alguacil'' (bailiff), and a ''fiscal'' (prosecutor); new positions were added as the institution matured. The inquisitors were preferably jurists more than theologians; in 1608 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] even stipulated that all the inquisitors must have a background in law. The inquisitors did not typically remain in the position for a long time: for the Court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for example, the average tenure in the position was about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inquisitors belonged to the secular clergy (priests who were not members of [[religious orders]]) and had a university education.

The ''fiscal'' was in charge of presenting the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The ''calificadores'' were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the ''notario de secuestros'' (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the ''notario del secreto'' (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the ''escribano general'' (General Notary), secretary of the court. The ''alguacil'' was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant. Other civil employees were the ''nuncio'', ordered to spread official notices of the court, and the ''alcaide'', jailer in charge of feeding the prisoners.

In addition to the members of the court, two auxiliary figures existed that collaborated with the Holy Office: the ''familiares'' and the ''comissarios'' (commissioners). ''Familiares'' were lay collaborators of the Inquisition, who had to be permanently at the service of the Holy Office. To become a ''familiar'' was considered an honour, since it was a public recognition of ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges. Although many nobles held the position, most of the ''familiares'' came from the ranks of commoners. The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.

One of the most striking aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorandum that a ''converso'' from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] directed to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Accusation ===
When the Inquisition arrived in a city, the first step was the ''Edict of Grace''. Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to "relieve their consciences". They were called ''Edicts of Grace'' because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a ''period of grace'' (usually ranging from thirty to forty days) were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of benevolence was effective, and many voluntarily presented themselves to the Inquisition and were often encouraged to denounce others who had also committed offenses, informants being the Inquisition's primary source of information. After about 1500, the Edicts of Grace were replaced by the ''Edicts of Faith'', which left out the grace period and instead encouraged the denunciation of those guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denunciations were anonymous, and the defendants had no way of knowing the identities of their accusers.&lt;ref&gt;Though over the course of the trial, their identities likely became apparent.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the points most criticized by those who opposed the Inquisition (for example, the [[Cortes of Castile]], in 1518). In practice, false denunciations were frequent. Denunciations were made for a variety of reasons, from genuine concern, to rivalries and personal jealousies.

=== Detention ===
[[File:Mateo Zapata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diego Mateo Zapata|Diego Mateo López Zapata]] in his cell before his trial by the Inquisition Court of Cuenca]]

After a denunciation, the case was examined by the ''calificadores'', who had to determine if there was heresy involved, followed by detention of the accused. In practice, however, many were detained in preventive custody, and many cases of lengthy incarcerations occurred, lasting up to two years, before the ''calificadores'' examined the case.&lt;ref&gt;"In the tribunal of [[Valladolid]], in 1699, various suspects (including a girl of 9 and a boy of 14) were jailed for up to two years with having had the least evaluation of the accusations presented against them" ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=180}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention of the accused entailed the preventive sequestration of their property by the Inquisition. The property of the prisoner was used to pay for procedural expenses and the accused's own maintenance and costs. Often the relatives of the defendant found themselves in outright misery. This situation was remedied only following instructions written in 1561.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Some authors, such as [[Thomas William Walsh]], stated that the entire process was undertaken with the utmost secrecy, as much for the public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] nor receive the [[sacraments]]. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Thomas William, ''Characters of the Inquisition'', P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons, 1940, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are few records of the time of the accused in prison, but the transcription of the trials repeatedly shows the accused being informed of every charge during the trial. They also show the accused answers, in which they address each accusation specifically. Given that they would be informed anyway, it makes little sense for the accused to be kept in the dark prior to the trial, unless the investigation was still open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:7d0f0b12-1c0e-49f6-b437-23206a95086d/original-primera-parte.pdf preserved transcripts of a trial as sample&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf Printed version of previous source&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The inquisitorial process consisted of a series of hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony. A [[defense counsel]] was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth. The prosecution was directed by the ''fiscal''. Interrogation of the defendant was done in the presence of the ''Notary of the Secreto'', who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation. 
In order to defend themselves, the accused had two possibilities: ''abonos'' (to find favourable witnesses, akin to "substantive" evidence/testimony in Anglo-American law) or ''tachas'' (to demonstrate that the witnesses of accusers were not trustworthy, akin to Anglo-American "impeachment" evidence/testimony).

The documentation from the notary usually show the following content, which gives us an idea of what the actual trial was likely to look like:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*A first page in which the notary wrote the date, the names and charges of the members of the tribunal, the name of the accused and the accuser, the accusation, and the names of everyone present in the room during the trial.
*A second page with the accused's first statement about their innocence or culpability, and their general response and recollection of the facts. This part usually takes from a thick fluid paragraph to a couple of pages and are relatively formal, within the accused's education level, from which one can suspect that the accused had time to prepare it prior to either the trial or the declaration, and probably help from the defendant. This paragraph also shows the accused addressing every charge from the first page, by points, which shows that the accused must have been informed of the charges against them.
*A third section with the ''fiscal'''s name and the transcription of a speech in which they address the accused's statement, also by points, and presents their case regarding each one separately.
*A fourth section, usually dated on the next day or a couple of days after the fiscal's intervention, with the name of the "procurador"( defendant) and the transcription of a speech in which they address the fiscal's arguments, again by points and separately, and defend the accused regarding each one. 
*A fifth section with the tribunal's response to this. In the vast majority of cases, the response is to order the search and calling of certain individuals, as witnesses, or of some experts such as doctors to testify and ratify some parts of what has been said, and giving a date for the tribunal to come together again and examine the evidence. Usually, the fiscal and procurator can ask for the presence of some witnesses here too, as it is inferred by them showing up later, but that is not always specifically stated in the transcripts and may be done outside of trial.
*The next section is often dated sometime later. Each witness or expert is introduced by complete name, job, relationship to the victim if any, and relationship to the case.  The witness's testimony is not transcribed word by word like in previous cases but summarized by the notary, probably because it was not prepared and does not follow a coherent, consistent order and writing implements were rather expensive to waste. 
* A page in which the procurador(defendant) declared the questions he is going to make to (usually another) group of witnesses of his choice since he often states that "he has asked them to come"or "he has called them". The answers given by each witness follow, with each witness presented as in the previous section. These testimonies are also paraphrased and summarized but addressed by points, with the answer to each question paraphrased separately.
*The fiscal and the procurador require equal copies of the testimony of the witnesses and keep them, demanding that no copy is shown to anyone until the end of a period of usually six days in which the witnesses have the chance to call the tribunal again to change their mind or add something.
*A third meeting of the tribunal with a new date. The transcription of a new speech by the procurator stating his view of the declarations and wrapping the witnesses' testimony up from his perspective. 
*A similar intervention, usually far shorter, from the fiscal.
*The response from the tribunal, paraphrased, which could be to dictate the sentence, but often was to require either further clarification from the witness (restarting the procedure from the second step) or call for another type of proof (restarting the procedure from the sixth step). These steps would repeat cyclically in the documentation of the trial, through different meetings of the tribunal and different weeks, until the tribunal has reached a conclusion.
*A literal transcription of the verdict and sentence. If the accused has been accused of more than one thing the sentence usually comes by points too. It is not uncommon for some of the accusations to be dismissed along with the process and said the process to continue taking into account the remaining ones. While sentences of innocence could be given at any point in a trial for multiple crimes, sentences of culpability only appear once the trial is over and all investigations opened against the accused are closed.

Regarding the fairness of the trials, the structure of them was similar to modern trials and extremely advanced for the time. However, the  Inquisition was dependent on the political power of the King. The lack of separation of powers allows assuming questionable fairness for certain scenarios. The fairness of the Inquisitorial tribunals seemed to be among the best in early modern Europe when it came to the trial of laymen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (october de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"LA INQUISICIÓN ESPAÑOLA".José Martínez MillánAlianza Editorial Bolsillo(2010)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies by former prisoners that, if believed, suggest that said fairness was less than ideal when national or political interests were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain a confession or information relevant to an investigation, the Inquisition made use of [[torture]], but not in a systematic way. It could only be applied when all other options, witnesses and experts had been used, the accused was found guilty or most likely guilty, and relevant information regarding accomplices or specific details were missing. It was applied mainly against those suspected of [[Judeization]] and [[Protestantism]] beginning in the 16th century, in other words "enemies of the state", since said crimes were usually thought to be associated with a larger organized network of either espionage or conspiracy with foreign powers. For example, Lea estimates that between 1575 and 1610 the court of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] tortured approximately a third of those processed for Protestant heresy.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Lea, III, p. 33, Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=185}}. {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=43}} finds the same statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; The recently opened Vatican Archives suggest even lower numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (October de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messori, Vittorio (2000). Leyendas Negras de la Iglesia. Editorial Planeta (this source is a Catholic apologist)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably. Torture was always a means to obtain the confession of the accused, not a punishment itself.

=== Torture ===
[[File:Picard.jpg|thumb|Inquisition [[torture chamber]]. ''Mémoires Historiques'' (1716)]]

Torture was employed in all civil and religious trials in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition was no exception. Its main differentiation characteristic was that, as opposed to both civil trials and other inquisitions, it had very strict regulations regarding when, what, to whom, how many times, for how long and under what supervision it could be applied.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. La Inquisición En La Época Moderna: España, Portugal E Italia, Siglos Xv-xix. Madrid: Akal, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"&gt;Haliczer, Stephen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=crCQmS_85EEC&amp;dq Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834], p. 79, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamenop"&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish inquisition engaged in it far less often and with greater care than other courts.&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters, Edward pp. 92-93"&gt;by Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the civil court, both Spanish and otherwise, there was no restriction regarding duration or any other point.

*'''When''': Torture was allowed only: ''"when sufficient proofs to confirm the culpability of the accused have been gathered by other means, and every other method of negotiation have been tried and exhausted''". It was stated by the inquisitorial rule that information obtained through torment was not reliable, and confession should only be extracted this way when all needed information was already known and proven. Confessions obtained through torture could not be used to convict or sentence anyone.
*'''What''': The Spanish Inquisition was prohibited to "''maim, mutilate, draw blood or cause any sort of permanent damage''" to the prisoner. Breaking bones was of course not allowed.&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; There was a closed list of the allowed torture methods. These were all tried and used in the civil courts all through Europe, and therefore known to be "safe" in this regard. Any other method, regardless of whether it was legal in the country or practiced in civil courts, was not allowed.
*'''Who''': Neither the elderly, the young, the sick or injured, or pregnant women could be subjected to torture. Torture of females was prohibited in all but the most extreme crimes and could not be performed by males.
*'''How many times''': Each accusation allowed for a different number of torment sessions on the same person (once the "when" condition of the culpability being supported by the strong external evidence was fulfilled). The number was dependent on how "harmful to society" the crime was. Counterfeit currency allowed for a maximum of two. The most serious offenses allowed for a maximum of eight.
*'''For how long''': "Torment" could be applied for a maximum of 15 minutes. The Roman Inquisition allowed for 30 minutes.
*'''Supervision''': The presence of a doctor was required at all times to ensure that no serious harm could result and to intervene in case of unexpected complications. It was also required for a doctor to certify that the prisoner was healthy enough to go through the torment without suffering harm.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo Vargas, Pablo L. La Inquisición Española Y Las Supersticiones En El Caribe Hispano. Madrid: Palibrio, 2011. pp120-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Per contrast, European civil trials from England to Italy and from Spain to Russia could use, and did use, torture without justification and for as long as they considered. So much so that there were serious tensions between the Inquisition and Philip III, since the Inquisitors complained that "those people sent to the prisons of the King blasphemed and accused themselves of heresy just to be sent under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction instead of the King's" and that was collapsing the Inquisition's tribunals. During the reign of Philip IV there were registered complaints of the Inquisitors about people who "Blasphemated, mostly in winter, just to be detained and fed inside the prison".  
Despite some popular accounts, modern historians state that torture was only ever used to confirm information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a prie Wellcome V0041650.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a priest supervising his scribe while men and women are suspended from pulleys, tortured on the rack or burnt with torches. Etching.]]

Rafael Sabatinni states that among the methods of [[torture]] allowed, and common in other secular and ecclesiastical tribunals, were ''garrucha'', ''toca'' and the ''potro''.,&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; even though those claims contradict both the Inquisitorial law and the claims made by Kamen. The application of the ''garrucha'', also known as the [[strappado]], consisted of suspending the victim from the ceiling by the wrists, which are tied behind the back. Sometimes weights were tied to the ankles, with a series of lifts and drops, during which the arms and legs suffered violent pulls and were sometimes dislocated.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini, Rafael, ''Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition: A History'', p. 190, Kessinger Publishing (2003), {{ISBN|0-7661-3161-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of te ''toca''(cloth), also called ''interrogatorio mejorado del agua'' (improved [[waterboarding]]/improved water interrogation), is better documented. It consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to [[waterboarding|ingest water]] spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Ryley, ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages'', p. 172, Columbia University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7103-0837-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''potro'', the [[rack (torture)|rack]], in which the limbs were slowly pulled apart, was thought to be the instrument of torture used most frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol. James, ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History'', p. 356, Houghton Mifflin Books (2002), {{ISBN|0-618-21908-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them all, the "submarino/ [[waterboarding]]" was by far the most commonly used, since it was cheap, and seen as "harmless and very safe" (safer for the victim than clothless waterboarding, hence the "improved" (''mejorado'') epithet).

The assertion that ''confessionem esse veram, non factam vi tormentorum'' (literally: '[a person's] confession is truth, not made by way of torture') sometimes follows a description of how, after torture had ended, the subject freely confessed to the offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, p. 65, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus confessions following torture were deemed to be made of the confessor's free will, and hence valid.

Once the process concluded, the inquisidores met with a representative of the bishop and with the ''consultores'' (consultants), experts in [[theology]] or [[Canon Law]] (but not necessarily clergy themselves), which was called the ''consulta de fe'' (faith consultation/religion check). The case was voted and sentence pronounced, which had to be unanimous. In case of discrepancies, the ''Suprema'' had to be informed.

=== Sentencing ===
The results of the trial could be the following:
# Although quite rare in actual practice, the defendant could be '''acquitted'''. Inquisitors did not wish to terminate the proceedings. If they did, and new evidence turned up later, they would be forced into reopening and re-presenting the old evidence.
# The trial could be '''suspended''', in which case the defendant, although under suspicion, went free (with the threat that the process could be continued at any time) or was held in long-term imprisonment until a trial commenced. When set free after a suspended trial it was considered a form of acquittal without specifying that the accusation had been erroneous.
# The defendant could be '''penanced'''. Since they were considered guilty, they had to publicly abjure their crimes (''de levi'' if it was a misdemeanor, and ''de vehementi'' if the crime were serious), and accept a public punishment. Among these were ''[[sanbenito]]'', exile, fines or even sentencing to service as oarsmen in royal [[galley]]s.
# The defendant could be '''reconciled'''. In addition to the public ceremony in which the condemned was reconciled with the Catholic Church, more severe punishments were used, among them long sentences to jail or the galleys, plus the confiscation of all property. Physical punishments, such as whipping, were also used.
# The most serious punishment was '''relaxation''' to the [[secular arm]]. The Inquisition had no power to actually kill the convict or determine the way in which they should die; that was a right of the King. [[Burning at the stake]] was a possibility, probably kept from the Papal Inquisition of Aragon, but a very uncommon one. This penalty was frequently applied to impenitent heretics and those who had relapsed. Execution was public. If the condemned repented, they were shown mercy by being [[garrote]]d before their corpse was burned; if not, they were burned alive.

Frequently, cases were judged ''in absentia'', and when the accused died before the trial finished, the condemned were burned in effigy.

The distribution of the punishments varied considerably over time. It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within the long history of the Inquisition. According to García Cárcel, the court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], one of the most active, employed the death penalty in 40% of the convicts{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!---It isn't very clear if it means 40% / 3% of all the convicts, of all the trialed, or if 40% of crimes were punished this way.---&gt; before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Auto-da-fé'' ===
{{main|Auto-da-fé}}
[[File:Francisco rizi-auto de fe.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] in Madrid, 1683]]

If the sentence was [[wikt:condemnatory|condemnatory]], this implied that the condemned had to participate in the ceremony of an ''auto de fe'' (more commonly known in English as an ''auto-da-fé'') that solemnized their return to the Church (in most cases), or punishment as an impenitent heretic. The ''autos-da-fé'' could be private (''auto particular'') or public (''auto publico'' or ''auto general'').

Although initially the public ''autos'' did not have any special solemnity nor sought a large attendance of spectators, with time they became solemn ceremonies, celebrated with large public crowds, amidst a festive atmosphere. The ''auto-da-fé'' eventually became a [[baroque]] spectacle, with staging meticulously calculated to cause the greatest effect among the spectators. The ''autos'' were conducted in a large public space (frequently in the largest plaza of the city), generally on holidays. The rituals related to the ''auto'' began the previous night (the "procession of the Green Cross") and sometimes lasted the whole day. The ''auto-da-fé'' frequently was taken to the canvas by painters: one of the better-known examples is the painting by [[Francesco Rizzi]] held by the [[Prado]] Museum in [[Madrid]] that represents the ''auto'' celebrated in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid on 30 June 1680. The last public ''auto-da-fé'' took place in 1691.

The ''auto-da-fé'' involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Peters 1988: 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; They took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours; ecclesiastical and civil authorities attended. Artistic representations of the ''auto-da-fé'' usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. However, this type of activity never took place during an ''auto-da-fé'', which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded, and executions were always held after and separate from the ''auto-da-fé'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=192–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the minds and experiences of observers and those undergoing the confession and execution, the separation of the two might be experienced as merely a technicality.

[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

The first recorded ''auto-da-fé'' was held in Paris in 1242, during the reign of Louis IX.&lt;ref&gt;Stavans 2005:xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish ''auto-da-fé'' did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six of the men and women subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed. The Inquisition had limited power in Portugal, having been established in 1536 and officially lasting until 1821, although its influence was much weakened with the government of the Marquis of Pombal in the second half of the 18th century. ''Autos-da-fé'' also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them. They also took place in the Portuguese colony of Goa, India, following the establishment of Inquisition there in 1562–1563.

The arrival of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain slowed inquisitorial activity. In the first half of the 18th century, 111 were condemned to be burned in person, and 117 in effigy, most of them for [[Judaizers|judaizing]]. In the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], there were 125 ''autos-da-fé'', while in the reigns of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] only 44.

During the 18th century, the Inquisition changed: Enlightenment ideas were the closest threat that had to be fought. The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the abolition of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them [[Pablo de Olavide|Olavide]], in 1776; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Iriarte]], in 1779; and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]], in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them: "friars who take [the position] only to obtain gossip and exemption from choir; who are ignorant of foreign languages, who only know a little [[scholastic theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its new role, the Inquisition tried to accentuate its function of censoring publications but found that Charles III had secularized [[censorship]] procedures, and, on many occasions, the authorization of the [[Council of Castile]] hit the more intransigent position of the Inquisition. Since the Inquisition itself was an arm of the state, being within the Council of Castile, civil rather than ecclesiastical censorship usually prevailed. This loss of influence can also be explained because the foreign Enlightenment texts entered the peninsula through prominent members of the nobility or government,&lt;ref&gt;Members of the government and the Council of Castile, as well as other members close to the court, obtained special authorization for books purchased in France, the Low Countries or Germany to cross the border without inspection by members of the Holy Office. This practice grew beginning with the reign of Charles III.&lt;/ref&gt; influential people with whom it was very difficult to interfere. Thus, for example, [[Diderot's Encyclopedia]] entered Spain thanks to special licenses granted by the king.

After the [[French Revolution]], however, the Council of Castile, fearing that revolutionary ideas would penetrate Spain's borders, decided to reactivate the Holy Office that was directly charged with the persecution of French works. An Inquisition edict of December 1789, that received the full approval of Charles IV and [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]], stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;having news that several books have been scattered and promoted in these kingdoms... that, without being contented with the simple narration events of a seditious nature... seem to form a theoretical and practical code of independence from the legitimate powers.... destroying in this way the political and social order... the reading of thirty and nine French works is prohibited, under fine...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, inquisitorial activity was impossible in the face of the information avalanche that crossed the border; in 1792, "the multitude of seditious papers... does not allow formalizing the files against those who introduce them".

The fight from within against the Inquisition was almost always clandestine. The first texts that questioned the Inquisition and praised the ideas of [[Voltaire]] or [[Montesquieu]] appeared in 1759. After the suspension of pre-publication censorship on the part of the Council of Castile in 1785, the newspaper ''[[El Censor]]'' began the publication of protests against the activities of the Holy Office by means of a rationalist critique. [[Valentin de Foronda]] published ''[[Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios]]'', a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons. Also, in the same vein, [[Manuel de Aguirre]] wrote On Toleration in ''El Censor'', ''[[El Correo de los Ciegos]]'' and ''[[El Diario de Madrid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument presented in the periodicals and other works circulating in Spain were virtually exact copies of the reflections of Montesquieu or Rousseau, translated into Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Inquisition==
[[File:Penitenciado por la Inquisición.jpg|thumb|The [[Peruvian Inquisition]], based in Lima, ended in 1820.]]

During the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain]] (1788–1808), in spite of the fears that the [[French Revolution]] provoked, several events accelerated the decline of the Inquisition. The state stopped being a mere social organizer and began to worry about the well-being of the public. As a result, the land-holding power of the Church was reconsidered, in the ''[[señorío]]s'' and more generally in the accumulated wealth that had prevented social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Church properties, in general, and those of the Holy Office in particular, occupied large tracts of today's [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalucia]]. The properties were given under feudal terms to farmers or to localities who used them as community property with many restrictions, owing a part of the rent, generally in cash, to the church.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the throne increased, under which [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers found better protection for their ideas. [[Manuel Godoy]] and [[Antonio Alcalá Galiano]] were openly hostile to an institution whose only role had been reduced to [[censorship]] and was the very embodiment of the Spanish [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition|Black Legend]], internationally, and was not suitable to the political interests of the moment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inquisition? Its old power no longer exists: the horrible authority that this bloodthirsty court had exerted in other times was reduced... the Holy Office had come to be a species of commission for book censorship, nothing more...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el Pensamiento Ilustrado''. Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inquisition was first abolished during the domination of [[Napoleon]] and the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1808–1812). In 1813, the liberal deputies of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]] also obtained its abolition,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Puigblanch]], ''La Inquisición sin máscara'', Cádiz, 1811–1813.&lt;/ref&gt; largely as a result of the Holy Office's condemnation of the popular revolt against French invasion. But the Inquisition was reconstituted when [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] recovered the throne on 1 July 1814. [[Juan Antonio Llorente]], who had been the Inquisition's general secretary in 1789, became a [[Afrancesado|Bonapartist]] and published a critical history in 1817 from his French exile, based on his privileged access to its archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of Llorente's criticisms, the Inquisition was once again temporarily abolished during the three-year Liberal interlude known as the [[Trienio liberal]], but still the old system had not yet had its last gasp. Later, during the period known as the [[Ominous Decade]], the Inquisition was not formally re-established,&lt;ref&gt;Historians have different interpretations. One argument is that during the Ominous Decade, the Inquisition was re-established- because of a statement made by [[King Alphonso]] upon a visit to the Vatican that he would reintroduce it if the occasion arose, but the Royal Decree that would have abolished the order of the Trienio Liberal was never approved, or at least, never published. The formal abolition under the regency of Maria Cristina was thus nothing more than a ratification of the abolition of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; although, ''de facto'', it returned under the so-called Congregation of the Meetings of Faith, tolerated in the dioceses by King Ferdinand.  On 26 July 1826 the "Meetings of Faith" Congregation condemned and executed the school teacher [[Cayetano Ripoll]], who thus became the last person known to be executed by the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=372-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day, Ripoll was hanged in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for having taught [[deist]] principles.  This execution occurred against the backdrop of a European-wide scandal concerning the despotic attitudes still prevailing in Spain.  Finally, on 15 July 1834, the Spanish Inquisition was definitively abolished by a Royal Decree signed by regent [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]], Ferdinand VII's liberal widow, during the minority of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and with the approval of the President of the Cabinet [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]]. (It is possible that something similar to the Inquisition acted during the 1833–1839 [[First Carlist War]], in the zones dominated by the Carlists, since one of the government measures praised by [[Conde de Molina Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon]] was the re-implementation of the Inquisition to protect the Church). During the Carlist Wars it was the conservatives who fought the liberals who wanted to reduce the Church's power, amongst other reforms to liberalize the economy. It can be added that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] is alleged to have stated that he would attempt to reintroduce it, possibly as a sop to Vatican approval of his coup.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The [[Alhambra Decree]] that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on 16 December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html 1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain]– ''The New York Times'', 17 December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Confiscations===
It is unknown exactly how much wealth was confiscated from converted Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated in one year of persecution in the small town of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the Spanish Inquisition. Greenwood Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-313-31667-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards of the time that "the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people". "They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred. "They burn only the well-off", said another. In 1504 an accused stated, "only the rich were burnt". In 1484 Catalina de Zamora was accused of asserting that "this Inquisition that the fathers are carrying out is as much for taking property from the conversos as for defending the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics." This saying passed into common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified. In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich. In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth "well over 2,500,000 ducats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death tolls and sentenced===
[[File:Contemporary illustration of the Auto-da-fe held at Validolid Spain 21-05-1559..jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of the auto-da-fé of [[Valladolid]], in which fourteen Protestants were burned at the stake for their faith, on May 21, 1559]]
García Cárcel estimates that the total number prosecuted by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions that appeared in the trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death. Nevertheless, some authors consider that the toll may have been higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García Cárcel for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively, and estimate between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"&gt;Data for executions for witchcraft: Levack, Brian P. (1995). The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition). London and New York: Longman, and see [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]] for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors disagree and estimate a max death toll between 1% and 5%, (depending on the time span used) combining all the processes the inquisition carried, both religious and non-religious ones.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eire, Carlos M. N. Reformations: The Early Modern World 1450-1650. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016 pp 640&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, this is significantly lower than the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe#Numbers of executions|number]] of people executed exclusively [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|for witchcraft in other parts of Europe]] during about the same time span as the Spanish Inquisition (estimated at c. 40,000–60,000).&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"/&gt; Other authors disagree with that statement though

Modern historians have begun to study the documentary records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the [[National Historical Archive (Spain)|National Historical Archive of Spain]] (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of all processes between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information for approximately 44,674 judgments. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions ''in persona'' and 778 ''in effigie'' (i.e. an effigy was burned). This material, however, is far from being complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no ''relaciones de causas'' from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no ''relaciones de causas'' from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but were not included in Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For full account see: Gustav Henningsen, ''The Database of the Spanish Inquisition. The relaciones de causas project revisited'', in: Heinz Mohnhaupt, Dieter Simon, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_Sdchs7yAkC&amp;hl=pl Vorträge zur Justizforschung]'', Vittorio Klostermann, 1992, pp. 43-85.&lt;/ref&gt; William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.&lt;ref&gt;W. Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy: The Spanish Inquisition from the Basque Lands to Sicily'', Cambridge 2003, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The secret archives of the Vatican regarding the Investigation have recently been disclosed, and are currently being revised. So far they support the lowest estimates given by historians for deaths and prosecution.

The archives of the Suprema only provide information about the processes which took place prior to 1560. To study the processes themselves, it is necessary to examine the archives of the local tribunals; however, the majority have been lost to the devastation of war, the ravages of time or other events. Some archives have survived including those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy, mainly minor "blasphemy",  and those of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dedieu, ''Los Cuatro Tiempos'', in Bartolomé Benassar, ''Inquisición Española: poder político y control social'', pp. 15-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate that the Inquisition was most active in the period between 1480 and 1530, and that during this period the percentage condemned to death was much more significant than in the years that followed. Modern estimates show approximately 2,000 executions ''in persona'' in the whole of Spain up to 1530.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of power===
Author [[Toby Green]] notes that the great unchecked power given to inquisitors meant that they were "widely seen as above the law"&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt; and sometimes had motives for imprisoning and sometimes executing alleged offenders other than for the purpose of punishing religious nonconformity, mainly in Hispanoamerica and Iberoamerica.&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 81A, n.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Green quotes a complaint by historian Manuel Barrios&lt;ref name="Green-2007-65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; about one Inquisitor, [[Diego Rodriguez Lucero]], who in Cordoba in 1506 burned to death the husbands of two different women he then kept as mistresses. According to Barrios, &lt;blockquote&gt;the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did not want to give her to [Lucero], and so Lucero had the three of them burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept for a long time in the [[Alcázar of Seville|alcazar]] as a mistress.&lt;ref name="Barrios-1991-58"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrios|first1=Manuel|title=El Tribunal de la Inquisicion en Andalucia: Seleccion de Textos y Documentos|date=1991|publisher=J.

Defenders of the Inquisition discrediting with Green are many and seem to be the growing trend in current scholarship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These authors don't necessarily deny the abuses of power but classify them as politically instigated and comparable to those of any other law enforcement body of the period. Criticisms, usually indirect, have gone from the suspiciously sexual overtones or similarities of these accounts with unrelated older antisemitic accounts of kidnap and torture,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; to the clear proofs of control that the king had over the institution, to the sources used by Green,&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Jaime y Gustav Henningsen (1986). “Forty-four thousand cases of the Spanish Inquisition (1540-1700): analysis of a historical data bank”, en Henningsen G., J. A. Tedeschi et al. (comps.), The Inquisition in early modern Europe: studies on sources and methods. Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or just by reaching completely different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2006). The Spanish Inquisition: a history. New Haven, CT : Yale University Press; p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Antonio Llorente: Historia crítica de la Inquisición en España (tomo IV, p. 183). Madrid: Hiperión, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the context of Hispano America, that Green refers to often, was different from the Iberian context studied for many of those authors, due to the distance from the immediate executive power of the King, and deserves to be examined separately. Among those who do, there are also discrediting voices regarding the nature and extent of the Inquisition's abuses.&lt;ref&gt;''Las luchas por la memoria en América Latina.

==Historiography==
&lt;!--NOTE: This intro paragraph is a high-level summary of the content below. Please add specific new information to the main sub-sections below.--&gt;
How historians and commentators have viewed the Spanish Inquisition has changed over time and continues to be a source of controversy. Before and during the 19th century historical interest focused on who was being persecuted. In the early and mid 20th century, historians examined the specifics of what happened and how it influenced Spanish history. In the later 20th and 21st century, historians have re-examined how severe the Inquisition really was, calling into question some of the assumptions made earlier periods.

===19th to early 20th century scholarship===
Before the rise of professional historians in the 19th century, the Spanish Inquisition had largely been portrayed by Protestant scholars who saw it as the archetypal symbol of Catholic intolerance and ecclesiastical power.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; The Spanish Inquisition for them was largely associated with the persecution of Protestants, or inexplicably, of witches.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; [[William H. Prescott]] described the Inquisition as an "eye that never slumbered".  Despite of the existence of extensive documentation regarding the trials and procedures, and to the Inquisition's deep bureaucratization, none of these sources were studied outside of Spain, and Spanish scholars arguing against the predominant view were automatically dismissed. The 19th-century professional historians, including the Spanish scholar [[José Amador de los Ríos|Amador de los Ríos]], were the first to successfully challenge this perception in the international sphere and get foreign scholars to make eco of their discoveries. Said scholars would obtain international recognition and start a period of revision on the [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt;

At the start of the 20th century [[Henry Charles Lea]] published the groundbreaking ''History of the Inquisition in Spain''. This influential work describes the Spanish Inquisition as "an engine of immense power, constantly applied for the furtherance of obscurantism, the repression of thought, the exclusion of foreign ideas and the obstruction of progress."&lt;ref name=kagan&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19kagent.html "A Kinder, Gentler Inquisition"], by [[Richard Kagan]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Lea documented the Inquisition's methods and modes of operation in no uncertain terms, calling it "theocratic absolutism" at its worst.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; In the context of the polarization between Protestants and Catholics during the second half of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=leabio/&gt; some of Lea's contemporaries, as well as most modern scholars thought Lea's work had an [[anti-Catholic]] bias.&lt;ref name=leabio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/mss/lea/leabio.html/ |title=Henry Charles Lea Papers - Biographical Sketch |website=Univ. of Penn.-Penn Special Collections |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html |title=A New Industry: The Inquisition |website=Catholic.net |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=12 November 1996|last=Van Hove |first=Brian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150258/http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1920s, Jewish scholars picked up where Lea's work left off.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; They published [[Yitzhak Baer]]'s ''History of the Jews in Christian Spain'', [[Cecil Roth]]'s ''History of the Marranos'' and, after World War II, the work of [[Haim Beinart]], who for the first time published trial transcripts of cases involving conversos.

Contemporary historians who subscribe to the idea that the image of the Inquisition in historiography has been systematically deformed by the Black Legend include [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]], [[Philip Wayne Powell]], [[William S.Maltby]],  [[Richard Kagan]], [[Margaret R. Greer]], [[Helen Rawlings]], [[Ronnie Hsia]], [[Lu Ann Homza]], [[Stanley G. Payne]], [[Andrea Donofrio]], [[Irene Silverblatt]], [[Christopher Schmidt-Nowara]], [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]], and [[Joseph Pérez]]. Contemporary historians who support the traditional view and deny the existence of a Black Legend include [[Toby Green]]. Contemporary historians who partially accept an impact of the Black Legend but deny other aspects of the hypothesis it include [[Henry Kamen]], [[David Nirenberg]] and [[Karen Armstrong]].

=== Revision after 1960 ===
{{Main|Historical revision of the Inquisition}}
The works of [[Julian Juderias|Juderias]] in (1913) and other Spanish scholars prior to him was mostly ignored by international scholarship until 1960.

One of the first books to build on them and internationally challenge the classical view was ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (1965) by [[Henry Kamen]]. Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed. The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Los Cuatro Tiempos, in Bartolomé Benassar, Inquisición Española: poder político y control social, pp. 15-39 and {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals and horse smugglers.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; Kamen went on to publish two more books in 1985 and 2006 that incorporated new findings, further supporting the view that the Inquisition was not as bad as once described by Lea and others. Along similar lines is [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]]'s ''Inquisition'' (1988).

One of the most important works about the inquisition´s relation to the Jewish conversos or New Christians is ''The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain'' (1995/2002) by [[Benzion Netanyahu]]. It challenges the view that most conversos were actually practicing Judaism in secret and were persecuted for their crypto-Judaism. Rather, according to Netanyahu, the persecution was fundamentally racial, and was a matter of envy of their success in Spanish society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/38335/personal-history/ Benzion Netanyahu’s History]&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged multiple times, and with some reasonable divergences the majority of historians either align with religious causes or with merely cultural ones, with no significant racial element.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Ángel Álvarez Palenzuela. ''Judíos y conversos en la España medieval. Estado de la cuestión'' (Jews and converts in medieval Spain. Estate of the matter). Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) eHumanista/Converso 4 (2015):156-191 [http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.span.d7_eh/files/sitefiles/conversos/volume3/11%20ehumcon4.palenzuela.pdf It can be checked for free here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging some of the claims of revisionist historians is [[Toby Green]] in ''Inquisition, the Reign of Fear'', who calls the claim by revisionists that torture was only rarely applied by inquisitors, a "worrying error of fact".&lt;ref name="Green-2007-10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] has written about popular myths of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/211193/real-inquisition-thomas-f-madden ''The Real Inquisition: investigating the popular myth''] by [[Thomas F. Madden]] ([[National Review]], 18 June 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
[[File:Francisco de Goya - Escena de Inquisición - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Inquisition Tribunal]] as illustrated by [[Francisco de Goya]]]]

The literature of the 18th century approaches the theme of the Inquisition from a critical point of view. In ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]], the Inquisition appears as the epitome of intolerance and arbitrary justice in Europe.

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic Period]], the [[Gothic novel]], which was primarily a genre developed in Protestant countries, frequently associated Catholicism with terror and repression. This vision of the Spanish Inquisition appears in, among other works, ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]] (set in Madrid during the Inquisition, but can be seen as commenting on the [[French Revolution]] and [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]); ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820) by [[Charles Robert Maturin]] and ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Jan Potocki]].

Literature of the 19th century tends to focus on the element of torture employed by the Inquisition. In France, in the early 19th century, the [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Cornelia Bororquia, or the Victim of the Inquisition]]'', which has been attributed to Spaniard [[Luiz Gutiérrez]], and is based on the case of [[María de Bohórquez]], ferociously criticizes the Inquisition and its representatives. The Inquisition also appears in one of the chapters of the novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880) by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which imagines an encounter between [[Jesus]] and the Inquisitor General. One of the best known stories of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", explores along the same lines the use of torture by the Inquisition. [[File:Ф.Гойя. Из цикла Los Caprichos 1797-98.jpg|thumb|upright|''There was no remedy'', from ''[[Caprichos|Los Caprichos]]'', 1797–98, by Francisco de Goya.]] The novel [[Cornelia Bororquia]] was published in France, probably by a French writer under the false name of Luis Gutiérrez. The Inquisition, as portrayed by the Black legend, has a prominent role in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

The Inquisition also appears in 20th-century literature. ''La Gesta del Marrano'', by the Argentine author [[Marcos Aguinis]], portrays the length of the Inquisition's arm to reach people in Argentina during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first book in [[Les Daniels]]' "Don Sebastian Vampire Chronicles", ''The Black Castle'' (1978), is set in 15th-century Spain and includes both descriptions of Inquisitorial questioning and an [[auto-da-fé]], as well as [[Tomás de Torquemada]] appearing in one chapter. The [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' shows the Inquisition targeting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]] for "blasphemy". The character [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] also appears as the [[Grand Inquisitor]]. The [[Captain Alatriste]] novels by the Spanish writer [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] are set in the early 17th century. The second novel, ''Purity of Blood'', has the narrator being tortured by the Inquisition and describes an [[auto-da-fé]]. [[Carme Riera]]'s novella, published in 1994, ''[[Dins el Darrer Blau]]'' (''In the Last Blue'') is set during the repression of the ''chuetas'' (''conversos'' from [[Majorca]]) at the end of the 17th century. In 1998, the Spanish writer [[Miguel Delibes]] published the historical novel ''The Heretic'', about the Protestants of [[Valladolid]] and their repression by the Inquisition. [[Samuel Shellabarger]]'s ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' deals directly with the Spanish Inquisition during the first part of the novel.

In the novel [[Cathedral of the Sea|La Catedral del Mar]]  by [[Ildefonso Falcones]], published in 2006 and set in the 14th century, there are scenes of inquisition investigations in small towns and a great scene in Barcelona.

===Film===
* The 1947 epic ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], starring [[Tyrone Power]], uses the Inquisition as the major plot point of the film. It tells how powerful families used its evils to ruin their rivals. The first part of the film shows this and the reach of the Inquisition reoccurs throughout this movie following [[Pedro De Vargas]] (played by Power) even to the 'New World'.
* The [[The History of the World Part 1#The Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition segment]] of the 1981 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[The History of the World Part 1]]'' is a comedic musical performance based on the activities of the first [[Inquisitor General]] of Spain, [[Tomás de Torquemada]].
* The film ''[[The Fountain]]'' (2006), by [[Darren Aronofsky]], features the Spanish Inquisition as part of a plot in 1500 when the Grand Inquisitor threatens Queen Isabella's life.
* ''[[Goya's Ghosts]]'' (2006) by [[Miloš Forman]] is set in Spain between 1792 and 1809 and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule.
* The film ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2016) by [[Justin Kurzel]], starring [[Michael Fassbender]], is set in both modern times and Spain during the Inquisition. The film follows Callum Lynch (played by Fassbender) as he is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nehra (also played by Fassbender), an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition.
* ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' ([[Roger Corman]], 1961).
*''[[Akelarre]]'' (Pedro Olea, 1984), a film, about the [[Logroño]] trial of the [[Zugarramurdi witches]].
*[[Tomás de Torquemada]] is portrayed in ''[[1492: The Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992)

===Theatre, music, television, and video games===

* The Grand Inquisitor of Spain plays a part in ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' (1867), a play by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (which was the basis for the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' in five acts by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in which the Inquisitor is also featured, and the third act is dedicated to an ''auto-da-fé'').
* In the ''[[Monty Python]]'' comedy team's [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketches]], an inept Inquisitor group repeatedly bursts into scenes after someone utters the words "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition", screaming "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" The Inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of [[torture]], including a dish-drying [[Rack (torture)|rack]], soft cushions and a comfy chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_Y4MbUCLY 'Spanish Inquisition' Compilation - Monty Python's Flying Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spanish Inquisition features as a main plot line element of the 2009 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.
*The video game ''[[Nicolas Eymerich]]'' features a cruel, bloodthirsty and torture hungry Inquisitor as the main character.
* The Universe of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' borrows several elements and concepts of the Catholic church Imaginarium, including the notion of the Black Legend's ideal of a fanatic Inquisitors, for some of its troops in ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr]]''.
*The 1965 musical [[Man of La Mancha]] depicts a fictionalized account of author [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' run-in with Spanish authorities. The character of Cervantes produces a play-within-a-play of his unfinished manuscript, [[Don Quixote]], while he awaits sentencing by the Inquisition.

===Contemporary politics===

The Spanish Inquisition is a recurring trope that makes an occasional appearance in the British parliament, similar to calling something "nazi" to reject ideas seen as religiously authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England: From the Norman, Volumen 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunpendulum''' is an art, science and technology project&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;  devised by [[Austria]]n [[New media art|media artist]] Kurt Hofstetter.&lt;ref name="Basis Wien"/&gt;

==Concept==
;''Watching the sky&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Inplusion" phase''
Twelve [[video camera]]s called "time-eyes" are connected to the [[internet]] in twelve locations in twelve [[time zone]]s around the [[Earth]], observing the sky twenty four hours per day, continuously creating a hypothetical "sun clock" which spans the planet.&lt;ref name="Inplusion"/&gt;

;''Viewing the results&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Explosion" phase''
→ '' &lt;small&gt;'''Note:'''&lt;/small&gt; This section describes "pavilions" which have not been constructed or installed.''

[[Image:stationphi.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model pavilion.]]
At a location to be determined within each time zone, twelve screens are intended to be arranged in a circle within a [[pavilion]]&lt;ref name="Pavilion"/&gt;  meant to remain open for visitors twenty four hours per day.  The screens, connected online with the time-eyes, transmit the images from the twelve time zones.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;  As the earth rotates, the images transmitted by the time-eyes move within a pavilion's circle of screens where day and night may be vicariously experienced in parallel. 
 
Each pavilion, a circular structure of twenty four pairs of half cylinders, each pair of which resembles in horizontal cross section the [[Hopi]] symbol '''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' '''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''' for universal brotherhood,&lt;ref name="Symbol"/&gt; is intended to allow twenty four points of entry for visitors while preventing local light from reaching the screens.  An arrangement of rooftop [[solar cell]]s is hypothesized to produce the necessary energy.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;

==Kernel team==
The kernel team consists of scientists (chiefly from the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms at the [[Vienna University of Technology]]) and artists.  Its primary tasks are ongoing technical developments which maintain the integrity of the project and its hardware and software.

==Collaboration partners==
The collaboration partners are scientific and academic institutions which host the time-eye cameras, hardware and servers and participate in the project's international [[cross-cultural]] cooperation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">In 1936, [[Alfred Tarski]] set out an [[axiomatization]] of the [[real number]]s and their arithmetic, consisting of only  the 8 [[axiom]]s shown below and a mere four [[primitive notion]]s:&lt;ref name=tarski&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarski|first1=Alfred|title=Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences|date=24 March 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504472-0|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of reals denoted '''R''', a [[binary relation|binary]] [[total order]] over '''R''', denoted by [[infix]] &lt;, a [[binary operation]] of addition over '''R''', denoted by infix +, and the constant 1.

The literature occasionally mentions this axiomatization but never goes into detail, notwithstanding its economy and elegant [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] properties. This axiomatization appears little known, possibly because of its [[second-order logic|second-order]] nature. Tarski's axiomatization can be seen as a version of the more usual [[real number#Definition|definition of real numbers]] as the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]]; it is however made much more concise by using unorthodox variants of standard algebraic axioms and other subtle tricks (see e.g. axioms 4 and 5, which combine together the usual four axioms of [[abelian group]]s).

The term "Tarski's axiomatization of real numbers" also refers to the theory of [[real closed field]]s, which Tarski showed completely axiomatizes the [[first-order logic|first-order]] theory of the structure 〈'''R''', +, ·, &lt;〉.

==The axioms==
''Axioms of order'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;):

;Axiom 1 :If ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then not ''y'' &lt; ''x''. That is, "&lt;" is an [[asymmetric relation]].

;Axiom 2 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''. In other words, "&lt;" is [[dense order|dense]] in '''R'''.

;Axiom 3 :"&lt;" is [[Dedekind-complete]]. More formally, for all ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''', if for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', then there exists a ''z'' such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

To clarify the above statement somewhat, let ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:

:''X precedes Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

:The real number ''z separates'' ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' with ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

Axiom 3 can then be stated as:

:"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets."

''Axioms of addition'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +):

;Axiom 4 :''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 5 :For all ''x'', ''y'', there exists a ''z'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 6 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''.

''Axioms for one'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +, 1):

;Axiom 7 :1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

;Axiom 8 :1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

These axioms imply that '''R''' is a [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered]] [[abelian group]] under addition with distinguished element 1. '''R''' is also [[Dedekind-complete]] and [[divisible group|divisible]].

Tarski stated, without proof, that these axioms gave a total ordering. The missing component was supplied in 2008 by Stefanie Ucsnay.&lt;ref name=total-order&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ucsnay|first1=Stefanie|title=A Note on Tarski's Note|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=Jan 2008|volume=115|issue=1|pages=66–68|jstor=27642393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This axiomatization does not give rise to a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]], because the formal statement of axiom 3 includes two [[universal quantifier]]s over all possible subsets of '''R'''. Tarski proved these 8 axioms and 4 primitive notions independent.

==How these axioms imply a field==
Tarski sketched the (nontrivial) proof of how these axioms and primitives imply the existence of a [[binary operation]] called multiplication and having the expected properties, so that '''R''' is a complete [[ordered field]] under addition and multiplication. This proof builds crucially on the integers with addition being an abelian group and has its origins in [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus']] definition of magnitude.

'''''The Human Drift''''' is a work of [[Utopia]]n social planning, written by [[King Camp Gillette]] and first published in [[1894 in literature|1894]].&lt;ref&gt;King C. Gillette, ''The Human Drift'', Boston, New Era Publishing Co., 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The book details Gillette's theory that replacing competitive corporations with a single giant publicly owned trust ("the United Company") would cure virtually all social ills. 

==The plan==
One-third of the book is devoted to Gillette's plan for an immense three-level metropolis (called "Metropolis") on the site of [[Niagara Falls]]. Designed to accommodate a population of tens of millions of inhabitants, the mega-city would draw its electric power from the Falls. (A photograph of the Falls served as the book's [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]].) The first large electrical generating facilities at Niagara Falls, utilizing the new [[alternating current]] system of [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[George Westinghouse]], were being constructed at the time Gillette wrote.&lt;ref&gt;David Lindsay, ''House of Invention: The Secret Life of Everyday Objects'', New York, Lyons Press, 2000; p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillette's city was to possess "a perfect economical system of production and distribution," run by the United Company; it would in fact be the only city on the North American continent. Economies of scale would mean that a single one of every necessary facility &amp;mdash; one steel mill, one shoe factory, etc. &amp;mdash; would exist. Advances in mechanization would generate ever-greater efficiencies, and ever-greater wealth for the whole society. Social progress would be natural and inevitable; gender equality would be the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Vincent McGreevy, ''Imagining Niagara: The Meaning and Making of Niagara Falls'', Amherst, MA, [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994; pp. 124-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillette gives a highly specific picture of his metropolis: it is shaped in a perfect rectangle, 135 miles on the long side and 45 on the short. Even with necessary farming and mining, most of the rest of North America outside Metropolis would be a natural environment. Gillette saw the city as containing the full population of the United States at that time, sixty million people; he also thought that the city could accept another thirty million in future population growth. Gillette wanted the buildings of Metropolis to be built of porcelain, for endurance and cleanliness. (His thinking on this point may have been influenced by the famous "White City" of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893.) Gillette favored circular buildings, even for residences (25-floor apartment complexes), and a hexagonal street plan.

(Though the details of his plan were highly specific, Gillette was not rigidly committed to them; in a future revised version he would switch to a circular shape for his city, and raise the apartment buildings to 50 stories.)

The text of ''The Human Drift'' was accompanied with abundant illustrations and plans, a graph of the "Educational and Industrial Pyramid," and other features of Gillette's scheme.

"His book is important for the attention it received in its time," though today it is "a curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Mizruchi, "Realist utopias," in: Sacvan Bercovitch, general editor, ''The Cambridge History of American Literature'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005; p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later books==
Gillette continued his Utopian argument in two subsequent books, ''World Corporation'' (1910) and ''The People's Corporation'' (1924). Other works also propounded his views.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Linwood Severy, ''Gillette's Social Redemption'', Boston, Herbert B. Turner &amp; Co., 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Linwood Severy, ''Gillette's Industrial Solution'',  Boston, Ball Publishing Co., 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Echota==
Nothing approaching Gillette's Metropolis has ever been attempted; but the Niagara Falls area was the site of one planned community, a [[Company_town#Model_company_towns|model workers' town]] named Echota (which means "town of refuge" in the [[Cherokee]] language). It was designed by the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1891 and built by the Niagara Falls Power Company.&lt;ref&gt;Ginger Strand, ''Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power, and Lies'', New York, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2008; pp. 260-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book argues that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too Want the Good Life? Your Neighbors Need It, Too] by Brooke Jarvis, March 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that for each of eleven different health and social problems: [[physical health]], [[mental health]], [[drug abuse]], [[education]], [[imprisonment]], [[obesity]], [[social mobility]], [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and community life, [[violence]], [[teenage pregnancies]], and [[Childhood#Healthy childhoods|child well-being]], outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries, whether rich or poor.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt;

=== Positive reviews ===
In a review for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Michael Sargent said that "In their new book, epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett extend this idea" (of the harm caused by status differences) "with a far-reaching analysis of the social consequences of income inequality. Using statistics from reputable independent sources, they compare indices of health and social development in 23 of the world's richest nations and in the individual US states. Their striking conclusion is that the societies that do best for their citizens are those with the narrowest income differentials—such as Japan and the Nordic countries and the US state of New Hampshire. The most unequal—the United States as a whole, the United Kingdom and Portugal—do worst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/4581109a|last=Sargent |first=Michael |title=Why Inequality is Fatal |journal=Nature |volume=458 |pages=1109–1110 |date=30 April 2009|issue=7242}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer [[David Runciman]] said that the book fudged the issue of its subtitle thesis of its UK first edition, and asked whether it is that “in more equal societies almost everyone does better, or is it simply that everyone does better on average?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Runciman |author1-link=David Runciman |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n20/david-runciman/how-messy-it-all-is |title=How messy it all is |journal=London Review of Books |volume=31 |issue=20 |pages=3-6 |date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the review he stated that, "More equality is a good thing and it’s an idea that’s worth defending." Richard Wilkinson responded to the review in a letter, claiming that "while pointing out that we do not have evidence on the fraction of one percent who are very rich, we show that people at all other levels of the social hierarchy do better in more equal societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Wilkinson |date=21 October 2009 |url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/lrb-letter |title=Letter to the London Review of Books |website=The Equality Trust |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306125605/http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/lrb-letter |archivedate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd Tonkin, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', described it as "an intellectual flagship of post-crisis compassion, this reader-friendly fusion of number-crunching and moral uplift has helped steer a debate about the route to a kinder, fairer nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=29 January 2010|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-spirit-level-by-richard-wilkinson--kate-pickett-1882275.html|first1=Boyd|last1=Tonkin|accessdate=2010-03-12 | location=London | title=The Spirit Level, By Richard Wilkinson &amp; Kate Pickett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Hutton]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' described it as "A remarkable new book ...the implications are profound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 March 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/15/equality-economy-will-hutton|first1=Will|last1=Hutton|author1-link=Will Hutton|accessdate=2010-03-12 | location=London | title=Look no further than inequality for the source of all our ills}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Hattersley]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' called it "a crucial contribution to the ideological argument",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=26 March 2009|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/03/spirit-level-wilkinson-pickett|title=Last among equals|first1=Roy|last1=Hattersley|author1-link=Roy Hattersley|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed it as one of their top ten books of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=10 December 2009 |title=Top 10: books of the decade|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/12/160-staff-chosen-world-book|accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
[[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] in ''[[The Financial Times]]'' said that "the evidence presented in the book is mostly a series of scatter diagrams, with a regression line drawn through them. No data is provided on the estimated equations, or on relevant statistical tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=John|last1=Kay|newspaper=The Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/77b1bd26-14db-11de-8cd1-0000779fd2ac.html|title=The Spirit Level|author1-link=John Kay (economist)|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=2010-02-10}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance tests and correlation coefficients were included in the November 2010 revised paperback edition of the book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Richard |last2=Pickett |first2=Kate |date=2010 |title=The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone |language=English |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03236-8 |pages=284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also appear on the Equality Trust website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/notes-statistical-sources-and-methods |title=Notes on Statistical Sources and Methods |author=&lt;!-- no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!-- unknown; redirected from previous URLs--&gt; |website=The [[Equality Trust]] |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where source data is also available and there is an explanation for the omission that "the book's intended readership was not confined to those with statistical training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/what-about-statistical-tests-relationships-between-inequality-and-social-problems |title=What about statistical tests of the relationships between inequality and social problems? |author=&lt;!-- no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!-- unknown--&gt; |website=The [[Equality Trust]] |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Reeves in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the book "a thorough-going attempt to demonstrate scientifically the benefits of a smaller gap between rich and poor", but said there were problems with the book's approach. "Drawing a line through a series of data points signals nothing concrete about statistical significance ... since they do not provide any statistical analyses, this can't be verified." He later noted that, "''The Spirit Level'' is strongest on Wilkinson's home turf: health. The links between average health outcomes and income inequality do appear strong, and disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Richard Reeves|date=5 April 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/05/spirit-level-richard-wilkinson|title=In search of the truth about equality in Britain|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''European Sociological Review'', sociologist [[John Goldthorpe]] argued that the book relied too heavily on [[income inequality]] over other forms of inequality (including broader [[economic inequality]]), and demonstrated a one-dimensional understanding of [[social stratification]], with [[social class]] being in effect treated as merely a marker for income. He concluded that much more research was needed to support either the Wilkinson and Pickett "account of the psychosocial generation of the contextual effects of inequality on health or the rival neo-materialist account".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldthorpe |first1=John H. |author1-link=John Goldthorpe |date=2010 |url=http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/6/731.abstract |title=Analysing Social Inequality: A Critique of Two Recent Contributions from Economics and Epidemiology |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=731-744 |doi= 10.1093/esr/jcp046 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' declared it to be "more a socialist tract than an objective analysis of poverty".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 February 2010, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/7193991/Inequality-is-not-a-social-illness-to-be-cured.html Inequality is not a social illness to be 'cured']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Hassan]] in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' maintained against Wilkinson and Pickett's claim that "more equal societies almost always do better" that it "is not possible to make the claim that everyone gains from greater equality", and suggests one of the book's "central weaknesses" is the "absence of the importance of politics.... They let neo-liberalism and free market fundamentalism off the hook".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Hassan]], [[The Scotsman]], 31 July 2010, [http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Gerry-Hassan-The-Spirit-Level.6449994.jp 'The Spirit Level lacks all balance to be correct']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Re-analyses and alleged failures to replicate ====
In 2010, Tino Sanandaji and others wrote an article for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in which they said, "when we attempted to duplicate their findings with data from the U.N. and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ([[OECD]]), we found no such correlation".&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB127862421912914915|title=Un-Level Ground|author= Nima Sanandaji , Tino Sanandaji , Arvid Malm and [[Christopher Snowdon]] |newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickett and Wilkinson addressed the ''Wall Street Journal'' article in a letter to the ''Journal''&lt;ref name="wsj-reply" /&gt; and published a response to the Taxpayers Alliance report on their own site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/response-to-tax-payers-alliance.pdf "The authors' individual response to The Spirit Illusion a critical analysis of how The Spirit Level compares countries" pdf], Accessed: 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In their response to the Wall Street Journal they said ,"...we use income inequality data from the United Nations, rather than the OECD, because the OECD data were not intended primarily for cross-national comparisons. However, even if we test our results using the OECD measures we find 28 of 29 relationships are still significant".'&lt;ref name="wsj-reply" /&gt;

[[Peter Robert Saunders]], Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Sussex University]], published a report for the think tank [[Policy Exchange]] questioning the statistics in ''The Spirit Level''. He claimed that only one of the correlations in the book—that between infant mortality and income inequality—stood up to scrutiny, and that the rest were either false or ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders (2010), "[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/Beware_False_Prophets_Jul_10.pdf Beware False Prophets: Equality, the Good Society and the Spirit Level]", [[Policy Exchange]], 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson and Pickett published a response defending each of the claims in the book and accusing Saunders in turn of flawed methodology.&lt;ref name="response"/&gt; Saunders' statistical analysis was also assessed by Hugh Noble, who published an article explaining statistical inference in "The Spirit Level" and assessing the critique offered by Peter Saunders. Noble concluded that the critical analysis of The Spirit Level offered by Peter Saunders 'cannot be taken seriously because it contains so many serious technical flaws'.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2010), "[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/docs/hughnobletslrevisited.pdf The Spirit Level Revisited - Regression Lines, Correlation, Outliers and Multivariate Analysis]", 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Snowdon]], an independent researcher and adjunct scholar at the [[Democracy Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;''Velvet Glove, Iron Fist'' website, [http://www.velvetgloveironfist.com/index.php?page_id=4 About the author], accessed 8 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TaxPayers' Alliance]], [http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/research/2010/07/factchecking-the-spirit-level.html Taxpayers' Alliance website accessed 20 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; published a book largely devoted to a critique of ''The Spirit Level'', entitled, ''The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left's New Theory of Everything''.&lt;ref&gt;Snowdon, Christopher (2010), ''The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left's New Theory of Everything'', [[Democracy Institute]]/Little Dice, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its central claims is that the authors have cherry-picked throughout.  Snowdon suggests that Wilkinson excludes certain countries from his data without justification, such as South Korea and the Czech Republic.  The book includes homicide, but excludes suicide.  Prison population is included, but not the crime rate or crime survey data.  Government foreign aid is included, but (private) charitable giving is not. Datasets are selected or rejected to support the thesis of the authors.  Likely cultural confounding factors are not taken into account.  Regression lines are drawn which are dependent on a very small number of outlying countries, but this is not explained in the text.  Correlation is confused with causation throughout.  It also argues that Wilkinson and Pickett falsely claim the existence of a scientific consensus when much of the literature disagrees with their findings.   Snowdon's book also asserts that some of Wilkinson's previous publications have been criticized on the basis that "the strength of the association...seems quite sensitive to which countries are included".  Finally, in a reductio ad absurdum, the methods of TSL are used to show that the suicide rate is linked to the recycling rate.
Wilkinson and Pickett released a response to questions from Snowdon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/response-to-snowdon.pdf "The authors' individual response to The Spirit Level Delusion: fact-checking the left's new theory of everything" pdf], Accessed: 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and responded to similar criticisms in the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name="wsj-reply"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor: The Spirit Level|first1=Kate|last1=Picket|first2=Richard|last2=Wilkinson|date=21 July 2010|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703724104575378630669014128}}.  A longer version of the letter was at {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306125532/http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/391|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/391|title=Letter to the Wall Street Journal|date=21 July 2010|archive-date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowdon has in turn responded to their response on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;Spirit Delusion blog, http://spiritleveldelusion.blogspot.com/2010/04/20-questions-for-richard-wilkinson-kate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism of the book, Wilkinson and Pickett posted a note on the Equality Trust website which stated: "Almost all of the research presented and synthesised in ''The Spirit Level'' had previously been [[Peer review#Peer|peer-reviewed]], and is fully referenced therein. In order to distinguish between well founded criticism and unsubstantiated claims made for political purposes, all future debate should take place in peer-reviewed publications."&lt;ref name="response"/&gt; A Postscript chapter was also written in response to critics and is available in the US and UK second editions of ''The Spirit Level''.

In 2011 the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] commissioned an independent review of the evidence about the impact of inequality, paying particular attention to the evidence and arguments put forward in ''The Spirit Level''. It concluded that the literature shows general agreement about a correlation between income inequality and health/social problems, though suggested there is less agreement about whether income inequality causes health and social problems independently of other factors.  It argued for further research on income inequality and discussion of the policy implications.&lt;ref&gt;'Does income inequality cause health and social problems?', http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/income-inequality-health-social-problems&lt;/ref&gt;

These three worlds are identified in [[Hinduism]] and appear in early [[Buddhist texts]].

== In Buddhist cosmology ==
{{Main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In [[Buddhism]], the three worlds refer the following destinations for [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|karmic rebirth]]:
* Kāmaloka is the world of desire, typified by base desires, populated by [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell beings]], [[preta]], animals, ghosts, humans and lower demi-gods.
* Rūpaloka is the world of form, predominately free of baser desires, populated by [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]-dwelling gods, possible rebirth destination for those well practiced in dhyāna.
* Arūpaloka is the world of formlessness, a noncorporeal realm populated with four heavens, possible rebirth destination for practitioners of the four formlessness stages.&lt;ref name="fischer-schreiber" /&gt;

== Theosophical views==
According to [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s posthumously published ''Theosophical Glossary'' (1892):
* [[Kamaloka]] (or ''kamadhatu'') is the world of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]. Kamaloka has, like every other world, its seven divisions, the lowest of which begins on earth or invisibly in its atmosphere; the six others ascend gradually, the highest being the abode of those who have died owing to [[accident]], or [[suicide]] in a fit of temporary [[insanity]], or were otherwise victims of external forces. It is a place where all those who have died before the end of the term allotted to them, and whose higher principles do not, therefore, go at once into [[Devachan]]ic state—sleep a dreamless sweet sleep of oblivion, at the termination of which they are either reborn immediately, or pass gradually into the Devachanic state.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Rupaloka (or ''rupadhatu'') is the celestial world of "form" (''rupa''), or what we call "Devachan." With the uninitiated Brahmans, Chinese and other Buddhists, the Rupadhatu is divided into eighteen Brahma or Devalokas; the life of a soul therein lasts from half a [[Yuga]] up to 16,000 Yugas or [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpas]], and the height of the "Shades" is from half a [[Yojana]] up to 16,000 Yojanas (where a Yojana measures from five and a half to ten miles). Esoteric Philosophy teaches that though for the Egos for the time being, everything or everyone preserves its form (as in a dream), yet as Rupadhatu is a purely matter world, and a state, the Egos themselves have no form outside their own consciousness. Esotericism divides this world into seven [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyanas]], "regions", or states of contemplation, which are not localities but mental representations of these.
* Arupaloka (or ''arupadhatu'') is a world that is again divided into seven Dhyanas, still more abstract and formless, for this "World" is without any form or [[tanha|desire]] whatever. It is the highest world of the post-mortem Trailokya; and as it is the abode of those who are almost ready for [[Nirvana]], and is, in fact, the very threshold of the Nirvanic state, it stands to reason that in Anupadhatu (or Arupavachara) there can be neither form nor sensation, nor any feeling connected with our three-dimensional [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="blavatsky_glossary" /&gt;

== Hindu surname==
Trailokya is also a [[Hindu]] [[surname]], mostly belonging to the [[Daivadnya Brahmin]], a Hindu [[Brahmin]] [[sub-caste]].{{relevance inline|reason=And ''Wolf'' is also a surname, but do we add that to the article on wolves?}}

A '''typed [[lambda calculus]]''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

== Kinds of typed lambda calculi ==
Various typed lambda calculi have been studied. The [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has only one [[type constructor]], the arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;, and its only types are [[basic type]]s and [[function type]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt;. [[Dialectica interpretation|System T]] extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in [[Peano arithmetic]] are definable. [[System F]] allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in [[second-order logic]]. Lambda calculi with [[dependent types]] are the base of [[intuitionistic type theory]], the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework]] (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on [[pure type system]]s, [[Henk Barendregt]] proposed the [[Lambda cube]] to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of ''[[subtype|subtyping]]'', i.e. if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then all terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also have type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]].

All the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are ''[[strongly normalizing]]'': all computations terminate. As a consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to [[Girard's paradox]]. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as [[Gordon Plotkin|Plotkin's]] PCF, are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] (for Programming language for Computable Functions) is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily terminating.

== Applications to programming languages ==
In [[computer programming]], the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of [[strongly typed programming language]]s closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.

In [[ethics]], '''value''' denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live ([[normative ethics]]), or to describe the significance of different actions. Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs, they affect ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes, What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters. An object with "ethic value" may be termed an "ethic or philosophic good" ([[noun]] sense).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what "ought" to be. "Equal rights for all", "Excellence deserves admiration",  and "People should be treated with respect and [[dignity]]" are representatives of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include [[ethics|ethical]]/[[morality|moral]] values, [[doctrine|doctrinal]]/[[ideology|ideological]] (religious, political) values, [[norm (sociology)|social]] values, and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as [[altruism]], are [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic]], and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as [[vice]]s or [[virtue]]s.

==Types of study==
Ethical value may be regarded as a study under [[ethics]], which, in turn, may be grouped as [[philosophy]]. Similarly, ''ethical value'' may be regarded as a subgroup of a broader field of [[Values (Western philosophy)|philosophic value]] sometimes referred to as [[axiology]]. Ethical value denotes something's degree of [[importance]], with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. 

The study of ethical value is also included in [[value theory]]. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: [[anthropology]], [[behavioral economics]], [[business ethics]], [[corporate governance]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political sciences]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]].

=== Similar concepts===
''Ethical value'' is sometimes used synonymously with [[Good and evil|goodness]]. However, goodness has many other meanings and may be regarded as more ambiguous.

==Personal versus cultural perspectives==
Personal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms.  A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive.  Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.

===Personal values===

Personal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values are one of the factors that generate behaviour{{Dubious |reason=It appears to be a bold statement. It is well documented in human behavior theories (Bandura's social cognitive theory, TRA, health belief model, etc.) numerous factors may contribute to a given behavior: peer pressure, norms, access to proper infrastructure, beliefs, etc. I don't know Rokeach work, but either this statement misinterpret Rokeach work, either Rokeach is attributing too much weight on value. This bold statement should then be nuanced and provided with more theories/empirical studies. |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Rokeach |first=Milton |authorlink=Milton Rokeach |year=1973 |title=The Nature of Human Values |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence the choices made by an individual.

Values may help  common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value, the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Moral, religious, and personal values, when held rigidly, may also give rise to [[conflict (process)|conflicts]] that result from a clash between differing [[world view]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiese, Michelle. "[http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/underlying-causes Causes of Disputes and Conflicts]." ''Beyond Intractability''. Ed. Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess. Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. October 2003. Downloaded 13 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives, lay the foundations of law, custom and tradition. Recent research has thereby stressed the ''implicit nature of value communication''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2368340 Common values? Fifty-Two Cases of Value Semantics Copying on Corporate Websites] by Steffen Roth. Human Systems Management 32(4) (2013): 249–65. {{doi|10.3233/HSM-130801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer behavior research proposes there are six internal values and three external values. They are known as List of Values (LOV) in management studies. They are self respect, warm relationships, sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, fun and enjoyment, excitement, sense of belonging, being well respected, and security. From a functional aspect these values are categorized into three and they are interpersonal relationship area, personal factors, and non-personal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne D. Hoyer|author2=Deborah J. MacInnis|author3=Rik Pieters|title=Consumer Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mVuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-40286-4|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ethnocentric perspective, it could be assumed that a same set of values will not reflect equally between two groups of people from two countries. Though the core values are related, the processing of values can differ based on the cultural identity of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marieke de Mooij|title=Consumer Behavior and Culture: Consequences for Global Marketing and Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMOmwgs-EQMC&amp;pg=PT40|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publishers|isbn=978-0-7619-2669-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural values ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]], constructed by sociopolitical scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]

Individual [[culture]]s emphasize values which their members broadly share. Values of a [[society]] can often be identified by examining the level of [[honour|honor]] and respect received by various groups and ideas.  In the [[United States of America]], for example, top-level professional athletes receive more respect (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors. Another example is that certain voters (taken from surveys){{Citation needed|reason=No surveys have been cited in this statement|date=March 2018}} in the United States would not willingly elect an atheist as president, suggesting that believing in a God is a generally shared value.

'''Values clarification''' differs from '''cognitive [[moral education]]''':

* Value clarification consists of "helping people clarify what their [[personal life|lives]] are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others' values."&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;
Santrock, J.W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like [[democracy]] and [[justice]] as their moral reasoning develops.&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; 
 
Values relate to the [[Norm (social)|norms of a culture]], but they are more global and intellectual than norms.  Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of [[patriotism]].  Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest [[respect]] at a funeral. Different cultures represent values differently and to different levels of emphasis. "Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others."&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.

Members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple [[subculture]]s they belong to.

If a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms, the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging [[conformity]] or [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] the [[Deviance (sociology)|non-conforming behavior]] of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Furthermore, institutions in the [[global economy]] can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a "triangle of coherence".&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Pascal, WTO Director-General, Speech to the European University Institute in Florence on 19 February 2011 (http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl187_e.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, a value may come to expression within the World Trade Organization ([[World Trade Organization|WTO]]), as well as (in the second instance) within the United Nations – particularly in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) – providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability. In the third instance, the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in a [[globalization|globalized world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Pierre Valette-Florence|title=Marketplace Lifestyles in an Age of Social Media|year=2012|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7656-2561-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Nonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. [[European Union|EU]] policies based on the notion of "cultural exception" can become juxtaposed with the policy of "cultural specificity" on the liberal Anglo-Saxon side. Indeed, [[international law]] traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;

==Development and transmission==
Values are generally received through cultural means, especially [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] and [[Dual inheritance theory|transmission]] or [[socialization]] from parents to children.  Parents in different cultures have different values.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; For example, parents in a [[hunter–gatherer]] society or surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Spanish parents want their children to be sociable.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Swedish parents value security and happiness.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow "book learning" sense.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; The [[Kipsigis people]] of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call ''ng'om''. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call "nyadhi".&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html |title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else. |last=Day|first=Nicholas |date=10 April 2013 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that influence the development of cultural values are summarized below.

The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]] is a two-dimensional [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world|cultural map]] showing the cultural values of the countries of the world along two dimensions: The ''traditional versus secular-rational values'' reflect the transition from a religious understanding of the world to a dominance of science and bureaucracy. The second dimension named ''survival values versus self-expression values'' represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can be distinguished as tight and loose in relation to how much they adhere to social norms and tolerates deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pelto |first1=Pertii J. |title=The Differences between ‘Tight’ and ‘Loose’ Societies |journal=Trans-Action |date=1968 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=37–40 |doi=10.1007/bf03180447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uz |first1=Irem |title=The Index of Cultural Tightness and Looseness Among 68 Countries |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=2015 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=319–35 |doi=10.1177/0022022114563611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. A history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. It has been suggested that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelfand|first=Michele J.|last2=Raver|first2=Jana L.|last3=Nishii|first3=Lisa|last4=Leslie|first4=Lisa M.|last5=Lun|first5=Janetta|last6=Lim|first6=Beng Chong|display-authors=etal|date=2011-05-27|title=Differences Between Tight and Loose Cultures: A 33-Nation Study|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1100|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6033|pages=1100–1104|doi=10.1126/science.1197754|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21617077|bibcode=2011Sci...332.1100G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Jesse R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|date=2014|title=Tightness–looseness across the 50 united states|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/7990.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1317937111|pmid=|access-date=|volume=111|pages=7990–7995|pmc=4050535}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Studies in [[evolutionary psychology]] have led to similar findings. The so-called regality theory finds that war and other perceived collective dangers have a profound influence on both the psychology of individuals and on the social structure and cultural values. A dangerous environment leads to a hierarchical, authoritarian, and warlike culture, while a safe and peaceful environment fosters an egalitarian and tolerant culture.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and forms==

===Relative or absolute===
[[Relativism|Relative]] values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of ''absolute values'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/Vol%2015/Wittgenstein.pdf On Wittgenstein's Claim That Ethical Value Judgments Are Nonsense] by Arto Tukiainen. Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy 15 (2011): 102–11. {{ISSN|1393-614X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also be termed ''[[noumenal]] values'' (and not to be confused with mathematical [[absolute value]]). An absolute value can be described as [[Absolute (philosophy)|philosophically absolute]] and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; ''"we can speak as much as we want about "life" and "[[meaning of life|its meaning]]," and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Ethical Thought|author=Yaniv Iczkovits|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9781137026354|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WCIwY41bB1kC&amp;pg=PA46  46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic or extrinsic===
Philosophic value may be split into ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s''. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

An ''ethic good'' with ''instrumental value'' may be termed an [[ethic mean]], and an ''ethic good'' with ''intrinsic value'' may be termed an [[end-in-itself]]. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.

====Summation====
Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories.&lt;ref name=riukas&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Valu/ValuRiuk.htm Inherent and Instrumental Values in Ethics] by Stanley Riukas&lt;/ref&gt; Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the [[Summation|sum]] of instrumental (specifically the [[all instrumental value]]) and intrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in [[value system]]s, which is a set of consistent values and measures.

===Intensity===
The ''intensity'' of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.&lt;ref name=riukas/&gt;

It should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of [[instrumental value conditionality]]. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.

''Instrumental value conditionality'' in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.

In many [[life stances]] it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. [[maximization (ethics)|Maximizing]] lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.

===Positive and negative value===
There may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized,  negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized.

Negative value may be both [[intrinsic negative value]] and/or [[instrumental negative value]].

===Protected value===
A ''protected value'' (also [[sacred]] value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many others individuals. Protected values tend to be "intrinsically good", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritov, and  Baron|first=Ilana, and Jonathan|title=Protected Values and Omission Bias|location=University of Jerusalem, University of Pennsilvanya|pages=89, 90|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/pvom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called ''tragic trade-offs.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tetlock|first=Philip E.|title=Thinking the unthinkable: sacred values and taboo cognitions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00135-9|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=320–24|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]) because they can hinder businesslike (&lt;nowiki&gt;''utilitarian''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran|first=Scott|last2=Ginges|first2=Jeremy|date=2012-05-18|title=Religious and Sacred Imperatives in Human Conflict|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/855|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=855–57|doi=10.1126/science.1216902|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605762}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experimental studies directed by [[Scott Atran]] and Ángel Gómez among combatants on the [[ISIS]] frontline in Iraq and with ordinary  citizens in Western Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that commitment to sacred values motivate the most "devoted actors" to make the costliest sacrifices, including willingness to fight and die, as well as a readiness to forsake close kin and comrades for those values if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutson |first=Mathew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-do-people-die-fighting-cause |title=Why do people die fighting for a cause? |work=Science  |date=September 5, 2017 |accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of [[utilitarianism]], protected values are [[bias]]es when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron, Jonathan|first=Ilana, Ritov|title=Protected Values and omissions Bias as Deontological Judgements|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|pages=134–35|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/plm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Baron]] and Mark Spranca,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Jonathan and Spranca, Mark (1997). "Protected values". ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes''. '''70'''(1), 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; protected values arise from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s as described in theories of [[deontological ethics]] (the latter often being referred to in context with [[Immanuel Kant]]). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.

==Value system==
A ''value system'' is a set of [[consistent]] values used for the purpose of [[ethical]] or [[ideological]] [[integrity]].

===Consistency===
As a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are '''externally [[Consistency|consistent]]''' provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.

A value system in its own right is '''internally consistent''' when
* its values ''do not contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are or could be
** ''abstract'' enough to be used in all situations and
** ''consistently'' applied.

Conversely, a value system by itself is '''internally inconsistent''' if:
* its values ''contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are
** highly ''situational'' and
** ''inconsistently'' applied.

===Value exceptions===
'''Abstract''' exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. '''Situational''' exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:
* An '''idealized''' value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called ''absolutists''.
* A '''realized''' value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.

The difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a [[religion]] lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.

Implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a '''formal''' value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone’s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.

===Conflict===
Although sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are [[Right (ethics)|right]] or [[wrongdoing|wrong]], both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an [[ideological]] or physical conflict. [[Ethonomics]], the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems{{Citation needed|reason=No citation for this as the true definition|date=June 2017}}, enables us to understand [[politics]] and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.

An example conflict would be a value system based on [[individualism]] pitted against a value system based on [[collectivism]]. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Note that added exceptions can become [[recursion|recursive]] and often convoluted.
* ''Individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.''
* ''A society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.''
* ''A society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.''
* ''A society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.''

==Economic and philosophic value==
{{Further|Value (economics)}}
Philosophical value is distinguished from [[economic value]], since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.

Nevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the [[subjective theory of value]], the [[personal philosophic value]] a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the ''personal philosophic value'' of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a "personal economic value" in contrast to its "societal economic value."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11636">'''Wing-assisted incline running''' (abbreviated as "WAIR") is a running behavior observed in living [[bird]]s as well as a model proposed to explain the [[origin of avian flight|evolution of avian flight]]. WAIR allows birds to run up steep or vertical inclines by flapping their wings, scaling greater inclines than possible through running alone. The WAIR origin-of-flight hypothesis proposes that the nascent wings of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s were used to propel the animal up slopes, such as cliffs or trees, in a similar manner to that employed by modern birds, and that [[Bird flight|powered flight]] eventually evolved from this usage.&lt;ref name="bicudo"&gt;{{cite book|last = Bicudo| first = J. Eduardo| title = Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Birds | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = May 26, 2010 | pages = 15 | isbn = 978-0199228454}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its proposal, it was suggested that WAIR might have plausibly been used by feathered theropods like ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' to develop aerial flight.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt;

==WAIR in living birds==
[[File:Chukar Partridge RWD.jpg|200px|thumb|An adult chukar running on a horizontal plane]]
Wing-assisted incline running has been studied extensively in chicks of the [[chukar partridge]] (''Alectoris chukar''),&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"/&gt; and has been observed in juveniles and adults of other species of [[Galliformes]] as well as the [[rock dove]] (''Columba livia'').&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt; In chukar chicks, WAIR was experimentally demonstrated by comparing maximum inclines ascended by normal chicks to those with wing feathers trimmed or plucked entirely. On both smooth and rough surfaces, normal chicks were able to run up much steeper slopes than the other two groups, reaching maximum angles of 105° from the horizontal. Chicks used running alone at slopes up to 45°, then employed wing-flapping at greater slopes, and maximum slope successfully scaled increased with age.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt; When baby chukars hatch, they have not yet developed their flight feathers.  As the babies develop, it takes approximately one week for feathers to appear, and about three weeks for the ability to fly.  As the baby chukars grow and before flying for the first time, they use WAIR as a transition to adult flight.&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tobalske, B.

===Explanation of using WAIR over normal flight===
These galliformes might use WAIR instead of normal flight to reach tree branches because WAIR uses less energy than normal flight.  Fewer muscles are used in the process of WAIR than normal flight, specifically pectoral and shoulder muscles which contribute to wing flapping.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;  This provides an additional explanation as to why birds continue to use WAIR: it is faster than normal flight take-off, and running requires less energy than does flying.  Therefore; the hindlimbs, in conjunction with the wings, may produce quick bouts of energy which may allow the bird to catch prey.&lt;ref name=Dialetal2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dial|first1=K. P.|last2=Randall|first2=R. J.|last3=Dial|first3=T. R.|title=What Use Is Half a Wing in the Ecology and Evolution of Birds?|journal=BioScience|date=2006|volume=56|issue=5|pages=437–445|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2006)056[0437:WUIHAW]2.0.CO;2|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/437.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy also allows energy to be stored for use in a fight-or-flight situation such as to escape becoming eaten or caught.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dial&amp;Jackson2010"/&gt;  WAIR imposes less aerodynamic and physical forces than normal avian flight on the bird, an advantageous trait which may increase fitness.&lt;ref name="Dial&amp;Jackson2010"/&gt;  WAIR could have been used for balance purposes.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;
Many theories propose that the manifestation of WAIR in birds is for predatory escape purposes, in that they are able to run up extremely steep and past vertical slopes (such as the trunk of a tree) to escape from a ground-dwelling predator.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;  Another reason for the manifestation of WAIR may be for dispersal or to find food or resources, but this idea is mostly proposed as a survival strategy.&lt;ref name="Dialetal2006"/&gt;
Whether it is to evade predation, catch prey, enhance reproductive success, or simply a variation imposed for dispersal, flight among avian creatures has evolved to be a highly successful trait.

==Origin of flight hypothesis==
The WAIR hypothesis for the origin of flight is a version of the "[[Origin of avian flight#Cursorial model|cursorial model]]" of the evolution of avian flight, in which birds' wings originated from forelimb modifications that provided downforce, enabling the proto-birds to run up extremely steep slopes such as the trunks of trees. The hypothesis was prompted by the observation of living young chukar chicks using WAIR, and proposes that dinosaur wings developed their [[aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, possibly to escape from predators.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt; Originally, it was thought that birds need ''downforce'' to give their feet increased grip in this scenario.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dial, K.P. |year=2003 |title=Wing-Assisted Incline Running and the Evolution of Flight |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5605 |pages=402–404 |doi=10.1126/science.1078237 |url=http://dbs.umt.edu/flightlab/pdf/WAIR.SCIENCE.pdf |format=pdf | pmid=12532020 |bibcode = 2003Sci...299..402D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=Mechanics of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |pages=4553–4564 |url=http://dbs.umt.edu/flightlab/pdf/bundle%20and%20dial%20JEB%202003.pdf |format=PDF|author1=Bundle, M.W  |author2=Dial, K.P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1242/jeb.00673 | pmid=14610039 |issue=Pt 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study found lift generated from wings to be the primary factor for successfully accelerating, indicating the onset of flight ability was constrained by neuromuscular control or power rather than by the shape of the wing itself, and that partially developed wings not yet capable of flight could indeed provide useful lift during WAIR.&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"/&gt; Additionally, when both the power and work needed for WAIR were examined, it was identified that the need for pectoral muscles in flight increases with the angle being scaled. Thus, WAIR is a hypothesis providing a model for an evolutionary transition from terrestrial to aerial locomotion as birds skeletally adapted to meet the requirements to scale steeper and steeper inclines by flight.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson, B.

WAIR may have been present in [[oviraptorosaur]]s and [[therizinosauroid]]s, but as the adults, especially of therizinosauroids, would probably break the trees trying to climb, their hatchlings or chicks would have made it up easily. Because of this way to escape predation, early maniraptorans might have evolved their long arms, true feathers and fused [[furcula|wishbone]]s.&lt;ref name="holtz2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtz|first=T.R.

===Response===
One possible problem with the WAIR origin of flight hypothesis was noticed by [[Philip Senter]]. He argued that early birds, including ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', lacked the [[Bird anatomy|shoulder mechanism]] by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce on which WAIR depends is generated by upstrokes, Senter argued that early birds were incapable of WAIR or flapping flight.&lt;ref name="Senter2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Senter, P. |year=2006 |title=Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=305–313 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app51-305.html |format=Automatic PDF download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been proposed against the WAIR hypothesis, stating that it is too simplistic and does not take additional information into effect.  There have been additional mechanisms suggested, such as climbing claws, that would have provided an advantage for the birds, but are absent in fossil records or extant birds.&lt;ref name=NuddsDyke2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nudds|first1=Robert L.|last2=Dyke|first2=Gareth J.|title=Forelimb posture in dinosaurs and the evolution of the avian flapping flight- stroke|journal=Evolution|date=2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=994–1002|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00613.x|pmid=19154383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other arguments against WAIR include a lack of fossil evidence and no additional intermediate or transition stages available for study which would provide supplementary evidence for WAIR.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dialetal2006"/&gt;
