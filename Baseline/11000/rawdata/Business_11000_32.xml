'''Agustí Montal i Galobart''' was a president of the [[FC Barcelona]] for the years 1946 to 1952. Born in [[Barcelona]] in 1906 and died in 1964.

After the [[Spanish Civil War]] and during the early years of the [[Dictatorship]] by [[Francisco Franco]], between 1939 and 1953, the president was appointed by the authorities of the regime. Montal's presidency began on 20 September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.blaugranas.com/agustin_montal_i_galobart-itemap-118-2980-1.htm | title= blaugranas.com | accessdate= April 11, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150703190925/http://www.blaugranas.com/agustin_montal_i_galobart-itemap-118-2980-1.htm | archive-date= 2015-07-03 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; But success came only in 1952, when the team under the command of [[Ferdinand Daucik]] during a season won five titles - La Liga, the Spanish Cup, Copa America, the [[Trofeo Martini Rossi]] and the [[Copa Eva Duarte]]. This resulted in a significant increase in the Barca fans, so he decided to buy land to build a new stadium - the [[Camp Nou]], since Les Corts was too small to accommodate a growing group of followers. On 16 July 1952 Montal resigned as chairman to be replaced by [[Enric Martí Carreto]].

His son [[Agustí Montal i Costa]] was also chairman of the 1966 Barcelona 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idtipusrecurs_PK=7&amp;idnoticia_PK=343728| title = elperiodico.com | accessdate= April 11, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashraf Marwan''' ({{rtl-lang|ar|أشرف مروان}}&amp;lrm;, 2 February 1944 – 27 June 2007) was an Egyptian billionaire. Marwan spied for the Egyptian intelligence agency during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], feeding Egypt strategic information on the location of Israeli military assets

From 1969, Marwan served in the Presidential Office, first under Nasser and, then as a close aide to his successor, President [[Anwar Sadat]]. In 2002 it became known that, during the period leading up to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, Marwan spied for Israel (under the Mossad code-name "The Angel"). However, some Egyptian sources claim he was a double agent working for the Egyptian intelligence, although this has never been confirmed. His warning on 5 October 1973 that "war will start tomorrow", triggered an emergency Israeli military mobilization and prevented both a complete surprise on 6 October and the complete occupation of the Golan Heights by the Syrian Army a day later.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=978-0-06-242010-7|location=New York|pages=227-232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marwan died under mysterious circumstances in June 2007, falling from the balcony of his expensive London house.

Maj. Gen. (ret.) [[Zvi Zamir]], the Mossad Chief who was one of Marwan's handlers, describes him as "the best source we have ever had".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With Open Eyes |language=Hebrew |last=Zamir|first=Zvi|publisher=Kinneret-Zmora-Bitan|year=2011|isbn=978-965-552-134-4|location=Or Yehuda, Israel|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Parkin, a British journalist who investigated the case, regards him as the "20th century's greatest spy".&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;{{Cite news |last=Parkin |first=Simon |origyear=15 September 2015 |date=6 March 2018 |title=Who killed the 20th century’s greatest spy? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/who-killed-20th-centurys-greatest-spy-ashraf-marwan |work=The Guardian |location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that Marwan was a "double-spy" who worked for Sadat and deceived the Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Israel's Wars: A History of Israel Since 1947|last=Bregman|first=Ahron|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=62–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has questioned this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|date=2014|title=A Question of Loyalty: Ashraf Marwan and Israel’s Intelligence Fiasco in the Yom Kippur War |url=|journal=Intelligence and National Security|volume=30|issue=|doi=10.1080/02684527.2014.887632|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Marwan was born in Egypt on 2 February 1944 to a respected family. His grandfather was the chief of the [[Sharia]] courts in Egypt, and his father, a military officer, reached the rank of General in the Egyptian Republican Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ashraf Marwan: Fact and Illusion|last=Thawrat|first=Muhammad|publisher=Madbuli|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, at the age of 21, Marwan graduated [[Cairo University]] with a degree in chemical engineering and was conscripted into the army. At the same year he met Mona Nasser, the president’s second daughter, who was 17 at the time. She fell in love with him, but her father suspected that Marwan’s interest in his daughter stemmed more from her political status than her personal charms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Opportunist: "The Bright Side of the Moon|last=|first=|publisher=Egyptian Chronicles, 28 June 2007|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, under her pressure, he agreed to the marriage, which took place in July 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1968 Marwan started working in the Presidential Office under Sami Sharaf, Nasser’s aide-de-camp and the strong man of the Egyptian security service, who kept an eye on him. In late 1968 Marwan, Mona, and their new-born son, Gamal, left for London, allegedly for the continuation of Marwan’s studies. A few months later the young couple was ordered by Nasser, who was irritated by information concerning their lavish lifestyle, to return to Egypt, where Marwan continued working under Sami Sharaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ashraf Marwan: The Dilemma Child|last=Halef al-Tawil|first=Kamal|publisher=Al-Akhbar al-Lebnaniya|date=7 February 2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Marwan's service at the Presidential Office lasted eight years (1968–1976). Although, under Nasser, he held only a junior position, the president used him sometimes for delicate missions such as calming the crisis that erupted following General [[Saad el-Shazly|Saad al Shazly’s]] resignation from the army when his rival was nominated as chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=he Crossing of the Suez|last=el Shazly|first=Saad|publisher=San Francisco: American Mideast Research|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nasser's death in September 1970, Marwan became a close aide to President Sadat, who needed him by his side in order to demonstrate that he had the support of Nasser's family. In May 1971 Marwan played an important role in defeating an alleged coup attempt by Nasser's loyalists, including Sami Sharaf, against Sadat's rule. Following these events, known as the "[[Corrective Revolution (Egypt)|Corrective Revolution]]", Sharaf was arrested and Sadat nominated Marwan to replace him. Despite his official title, Marwan was actually Sadat's personal emissary, in charge of relations with Saudi Arabia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=76–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his new capacity, Marwan developed excellent relations with the Saudi and the Libyan leaderships. In Saudi Arabia he worked hand in hand with [[Kamal Adham]], King Feisal's brother-in-law, who established and supervised the Saudi security service. In Libya he was close to [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and his counterpart for many missions was the Libyan Prime Minister, [[Abdessalam Jalloud]]. Both Saudi Arabia and Libya provided Egypt with critical financial and military assistance before the Yom Kippur War. Libya delivered to Egypt [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage-5]] aircraft that were considered critical for the coming war and which, under the French embargo, could not be sold directly to Egypt. Marwan managed this Libyan-Egyptian deal as well as other highly sensitive issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph |first=Uri |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=34-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary to the President of the Republic for Foreign Relations ===
After the 1973 war Marwan continued his way to the top. On 14 February 1974 he became Secretary to the President of the Republic for Foreign Relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Al Ahram|last=|first=|date=15 February 1974|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new position that reflected Sadat's ruling style. Given Sadat's dissatisfaction with the conduct of his Foreign Minister, [[Ismail Fahmi|Ismail Fahmy]], Marwan was considered as a candidate to replace him.

By this stage, however, he accumulated a considerable number of personal enemies, who accused him of using his position near Sadat to gain personal wealth. When these accusations gained momentum, Sadat had to yield to the pressure and in March 1976 he ended Marwan's service in the Presidential Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Knew Sadat: Half a Century of Secrets About Sadat and the [Muslim] Brotherhood|last=Jamaa|first=Mohamed|publisher=Cairo|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadat: The Truth and the Legend|last=Sabri|first=Musa |location=Cairo |publisher=Al-Maktab al-Masry al-Hadeth|year=1985|isbn=|pages=651–662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab Organization for Industrialization ===
Marwan was nominated to head the [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]], an arms production complex in Cairo that was financed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. Following additional political pressures, Sadat had to relieve him from this position in October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Al Ahram|last=|first=|date=13 October 1978|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===
Following Sadat's assassination in October 1981, Marwan left Egypt and started a business career in London. He gained a reputation as a mysterious man who did not play according to the rules of the City. Among others he was involved in the failed attempt by [[Tiny Rowland]] to take over the [[House of Fraser]] – a group of department stores, whose jewel in the crown was Harrods, where the English aristocracy used to shop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marwan amassed significant wealth which has, to this day, never been disclosed. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lead-up to Yom Kippur War ===
Egypt had begun preparing a war with the aim of retaking the Sinai Peninsula that it had lost to the Israelis in the 1967 [[Six-Day War|Six Day War]]. Marwan’s unparalleled access to his nation’s best-kept secrets, especially after his promotion in May 1971, allowed him to provide Israel with information about the coming war—including the full Egyptian war plans, detailed accounts of military exercises, original documentation of Egypt’s arm deals with the Soviet Union and other countries, the Egyptian military Order of Battle, the minutes from meetings of the high command, accounts of Sadat’s private conversations with other Arab leaders, and even the minutes of secret summit meetings in Moscow between Sadat and Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=100–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior Israeli intelligence officer had said, by providing these documents Marwan turned his country, Israel’s main enemy, into an open book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpW8MzbDdAA|title=CBS 60 Minutes|last=|first=|date=9 May 2009|work=The Perfect Spy|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information Marwan provided made its way to the desks of Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]], and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in raw form. It shaped Israel’s strategic and tactical approach to Egypt and allowed the Israelis a direct look at Egypt’s war calculus, including Sadat’s minimal requirements for launching a war. These were mainly long-range attack aircraft and Scud missiles, without which Egypt would not be able to overcome Israeli air superiority.

=== Yom Kippur War ===
In October 1973 Sadat decided to launch war without waiting for these arms and Egypt accelerated its war preparations. Marwan reported on Sadat's decision and the military preparations for war but personally he expressed the estimate that ultimately Egypt would be deterred from militarily challenging Israel. Nevertheless, in April he (as well as other Mossad sources), warned that Egypt planned to attack in mid-May. Israel raised its state-of military readiness, but war did not come, probably because [[Hafez al-Assad|President Assad]] of Syria convinced Sadat to delay it until Syria was better prepared to occupy the Golan Heights.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assad: The Struggle for the Middle East|last=Seal|first=Patrick|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=0-520-06976-5|location=Berkley|pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known in Israel as "the Blue-White" alert, this episode eroded Israeli fear of an Arab attack. Consequently, by fall 1973, when Egypt and Syria geared to war, military intelligence leaders, including [[Eli Zeira]], refused to accept, despite numerous warnings and warning indicators, that the Arabs plan to attack. Accordingly, Israel’s leadership avoided the mobilization of the reserve army which in 1973 constituted 80% of the IDF ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Watchman Fell Asleep: The Surprise of Yom Kippur and its Sources|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=Albany, NY: SUNY,|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 4 October, about 44 hours before war launched, Marwan called Dubi, his Mossad handler in London, and asked to meet urgently the Mossad chief in order to talk about "a lot of chemicals" (code name for war). The meeting took place on Friday late at night in London and Marwan informed Zamir that "war would start tomorrow". As became evident recently, he did not know the exact D-Day when calling Dubi on Thursday and learned about it only after arriving in London on Friday morning. Because of this warning, Israel began mobilizing its forces on the morning of 6 October—hours before the attack was launched. Marwan's warning prevented a complete Egyptian surprise. Without it, the entire Golan Heights would have been lost, and the war likely would have ended with far greater Israeli losses of both territory and life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=194–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he met with Zamir once more in order to explain Sadat's warnings in a speech in the Egyptian Parliament, to launch missiles on Israel. The meeting took place in Paris on 18 October.

=== Post Yom Kippur War ===
On 28 October, a few days after the war ended and two days before Golda Meir started critical talks in the White House, Zamir conferred with "the Angel" once more to get information about Sadat's goals in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations that were to start.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Marwan continued working for the Mossad until 1998 and was handled throughout this period by his single case officer, Dubi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=239-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; His identity as a spy for Israel was revealed in December 2002, by the London-based Israeli historian [[Ahron Bregman]], who claimed that Marwan was a double-spy who deceived the Israelis. Bregman’s source was Maj. Gen. (ret.) Eli Zeira, the director of Israel’s Military Intelligence in the 1973 War and the main culprit in the intelligence fiasco prior to the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Intelligence Chief who Went Fishing in the Cold: How the Identity of Israel's Most Valuable Source in Egypt was Leaked by Maj. Gen. (res.) Eli Zeira|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|work=Vol.23, No.2|publisher=Intelligence and National Security|year= 2008|isbn=|location=|pages=226–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Marwan married Mona Abdel Nasser in the 1960s. One of Marwan's sons was married to the daughter of former [[Arab League]] Secretary General [[Amr Moussa]]. His other son, Gamal, is the owner of the television group "Melody" and a close friend of Gamal Mubarak, the son of former Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak|Husni Mubarak]].

== Death ==
Marwan died on 27 June 2007 outside his flat in [[Carlton House Terrace]], London. The [[cause of death]] was [[traumatic aortic rupture]] following a fall from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. News reports indicate that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] increasingly believe Marwan was murdered, a belief also held by Marwan's eldest son, Gamal. Marwan's funeral in Egypt was led by Egypt's highest-ranked religious leader, [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], and attended by, amongst others, [[Gamal Mubarak]], son of the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and intelligence chief [[Omar Suleiman]]. According to President Mubarak, "Marwan carried out patriotic acts which it is not yet time to reveal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Egyptian Intelligence Service: A History of the Mukhabarat, 1910-2009|first=Owen L.|last=Sirrs|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2010|isbn=9780415569200|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_the_Egyptian_Intelligence_S.html?id=-yzCBmGHuzEC|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a case review in January 2008, the investigation was transferred to the Specialist Crime Directorate, both because of its public nature and because the shoes Marwan was wearing when he fell, key evidence in the case, had been lost.

One witness, who was on the third floor of a nearby building, told police that he saw two men "wearing suits and of Mediterranean appearance" appear on the balcony moments after Marwan's fall, look down, and then return inside the apartment. Police are also reported to have lost Marwan's shoes, which could hold clues on whether or not Marwan jumped from the balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2FxDAAAQBAJ|title=Turnabout and Deception: Crafting the Double-Cross and the Theory of Outs|first=Barton|last=Whaley|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|year=2016|isbn=9781682470299|pp=I94-I96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marwan is the fourth Egyptian of note to die in London in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera-Goudsouzian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/05/death-balcony-egypt-201452911215374449.html | title=Death by balcony in Egypt | work=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=1 June 2014 | accessdate=14 September 2017 | author=Goudsouzian, Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others, all of whom were involved in Egyptian politics between 1966 and 1971, are actress [[Suad Hosni]]; Egyptian ambassador to Greece Al-Leithy Nassif;&lt;ref name="Egyptian Chronicles"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.co.nz/2010/05/egyptian-x-file-stuart-tower-beginning.html | title=Egyptian X-File: Stuart Tower, The beginning | publisher=[[Blogspot]] | work=Egyptian Chronicles | date=21 May 2010 | accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ali Shafeek, secretary in the office of former Egyptian Vice President [[Abdel Hakim Amer]].&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera-Goudsouzian"/&gt;

At the time of the investigation, Marwan's wife said she believed that Mossad was behind his death. However, an analysis in ''[[The Guardian]]'' found this scenario to be unlikely: "For one thing, killing a former agent after his name is revealed would seem to be a major disincentive for new recruits. Even if Israel believed that Marwan was a double agent, working for the Egyptians, better to do nothing and, through their silence, imply he was faithful to their cause."&lt;ref name=Parkin/&gt; Further, Marwan was at least the third Egyptian living in London to die under similar circumstances, all of whom had ties with the Egyptian security services.&lt;ref name=Parkin/&gt;

Egyptian journalist [[Amr Ellissy]] conducted an investigation into Marwan's death for his documentary series ''Ekhterak'', broadcast on Egyptian television in six episodes on the first anniversary of Marwan's death. ''Ekhterak'' was filmed in Marwan's London apartment and included interviews with his son, a witness, and acquaintances of Marwan. Ellissy published his book ''The Agent Babel'' in Arabic through [[Dar Al Shorouq press]], and it was launched on 2 February 2009.

The British magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' also followed the story closely and suggested that there was considerable cause for suspicion surrounding the circumstances of Marwan's death.

== Legacy ==
[[Ahron Bregman]], published in 2016 a book on his relationship with Ashraf Marwan, titled ''The Spy Who Fell to Earth''. In 2017, Salon Productions purchased the rights to turn the book into a feature documentary.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Professor [[Uri Bar-Joseph]] wrote a book published in 2016 titled ''The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel'', which was later used as the basis of a [[Netflix]] film, ''[[The Angel (2018 American film)|The Angel]]''. Bar-Joseph's book addresses whether Marwan was a genuine spy or a double agent. In a review of the book in the [[CIA]]'s ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'', Thomas G. Coffey states that the book persuasively "argues that the nature of the intelligence Marwan gave the Israelis was simply too destructive of Egyptian interests" for Marwan to have been a double agent, and that it offers "a convincing defense" against the claim that the intelligence he provided was "late, flawed, and of little practical use."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-60-no-4/the-angel.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bank Tabungan Negara''', officially known as '''PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk.''', is a [[commercial bank]] based in [[Indonesia]] and regulated by [[Bank Indonesia]], the nation's [[central bank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Bank Tabungan Negara operates under the brand name '''Bank BTN''' and its headquarters are located in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. Bank Tabungan Negara literally means "''State Savings Bank''" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://translate.google.com/?source=osdd#auto/en/Bank%20Tabungan%20Negara|title = Google Translate – Bank Tabungan Negara|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its products include banks accounts (savings, current, and fixed deposit), loans (personal, business, and home loans) and [[Sharia]]h-compliant banking services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=BBTN.JK#KVFI5sjsdQ3Wy3ei.97|title = Profile: Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk PT (BBTN.JK)|date = |accessdate = 22 November 2015|website = [[Reuters]]|publisher = [[Thomson Reuters]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Bank Tabungan Negara was established in 1897 under the name Postspaarbank, with its headquarters located in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], the bank was frozen and replaced with ''Tyokin Me or Chokinkyoku.'' After the proclamation of Indonesian independence, the bank was taken over by the Indonesian government on 9 February 1950 under the Emergency Law No.9 and renamed "''Bank Tabungan Pos''" (Postal Savings Bank).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1963 the bank's current name, Bank Tabungan Negara, was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.btn.co.id/id/content/BTN-Info/Tentang-Kami/Sejarah-Bank-BTN|title = History of Bank BTN|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2015|website = |publisher = Bank BTN|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank BTN became the first bank to be appointed by the government to provide housing finance and mortgages to lower and middle income individuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.btn.co.id/BTN/files/c3/c34ea41e-5e68-46d7-acf9-8a3bae23f671.pdf|title = PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk – Roadshow Presentation October 2012|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2015|website = |publisher = Bank BTN|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank underwent a corporate restructure in 2003, which was followed by an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in 2009 that led to the listing of Bank BTN on the [[Indonesia Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.antaranews.com/berita/164497/harga-saham-ipo-btn-rp800-per-lembar|title = Harga Saham IPO BTN Rp800 Per Lembar|date = 2 December 2009|accessdate = 26 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[ANTARA News]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPO was ranked as Indonesia's largest IPO as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cimb.com/content/dam/cimbgroup/pdf-files/annual-reports/annual-report-2009.pdf|title = CIMB Group – 2009 Annual Report|date = 31 December 2009|accessdate = 26 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[CIMB Group]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertil Eric Hult''' (born 1941&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xn--fretagsamheten-vpb.se/Entreprenorer/Entreprenorer/Bertil-Hult/ Företagsamheten.se: ''Världens största privata utbildningsföretag''], accessed on January 5, 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Swedish [[billionaire]] businessman, who founded the educational and language school company [[EF Education First]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks|title=Stocks|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he moved from Sweden to Germany, and in 1977, he established EF's head office in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he now lives. He served as the company's [[CEO]] until 2002 and as chairman until 2008. Today, he is semi-retired. His two oldest sons, [[Philip Hult]] and Alex Hult, now serve as the company's co-chairmen and his third son, [[Edward Hult]], is the CEO of EF Educational Tours. Under Bertil Hult's supervision, EF grew to a multi-billion dollar corporation with more than 40,000 employees in 53 countries.

==Early life and education==
Bertil Hult was born in Stockholm. He has spoken frequently about his struggles with dyslexia as a child. He dropped out of school after junior high and worked making coffee and running errands for a ship broker in London. He learned to speak English during this time and became convinced that immersion is the best way to learn a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/03/founder-bertil-hult-sees-education-first-breaking-down-global-barriers/KK6hpFwDqvocR73w0Xf9jO/story.html|title=Founder Bertil Hult sees EF Education First breaking down global barriers - The Boston Globe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Sweden and taking up his studies again, he entered Lund University, then dropped out after one year.

==Career==
Hult founded EF Education First at the age of 23 in the basement of his university dormitory in Lund, Sweden. He started EF as a language study and travel abroad organization, initially for Swedish high school students going to England to learn English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ef.com/about-ef/company/history/|title=Our history|author=|date=|website=www.ef.com|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood struggles with dyslexia convinced him that cultural immersion was a superior way to study a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/brollopet/article12362325.ab|title=Landets främste lyxlirare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the company's CEO until 2002, as its chairman until 2008, and then semi-retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/olympics/torch/2008-05/08/content_15118490.htm|title=Bertil Hult -- china.org.cn|author=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hult's supervision, EF grew to become a multi-billion dollar corporation with more than 40,000 employees across 500 schools and educational programs in 53 different countries. EF continues to open language schools around the world, grow its online language school (EF Englishtown), place [[Au pair|au pairs]] with American families, coordinate life-changing student travel, and international exchange experiences.  EF is affiliated with a business school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ef.com/about-ef/company/|title=Our company|website=www.ef.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hult International Business School]], formerly the Arthur D. Little School of Management, which is named after Bertil Hult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hult.edu/en/about-hult/meet-our-people/bertil-hult/ |title=Bertil Hult, Founder of EF Education First |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044211/http://www.hult.edu/en/about-hult/meet-our-people/bertil-hult/ |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EF Education First is wholly owned by Hult and his family. Forbes estimated Bertil's net worth to be 5 billion USD as of March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/bertil-hult/|title=Bertil Hult|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a keen sailor and his boat, ''EF Education'' with skipper [[Paul Cayard]], won the last [[Whitbread Round the World Race]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/history/7_history_1997-1998.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505192511/http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/history/7_history_1997-1998.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sails on his boat ''Erica XII''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superyachtfan.com/superyachtownersregister.html|title=Superyacht Owners Register - Billionaire Owners of Large Luxury Yachts!|first=Peter|last=Yachtfan|website=www.superyachtfan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat hosted the Swedish Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel on their honeymoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordstjernan.com/news/sweden/2414/|title=Sweden - Nordstjernan|website=www.nordstjernan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he was elected International Swede of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4312444|title=EF Education First AG: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=investing.businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bertil Hult was awarded the Lucia Trade Award by the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce for his contribution to fostering free trade between Sweden and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saccny.org/awards/lucia-trade/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Bertil Hult was named a Laureate by the World Entrepreneurship Forum.

==Charity work==
Apart from EF, Hult has been involved in charities fighting drug abuse and promoting dyslexia education. In 1993, he was a founding member of the Geneva-based Mentor Foundation, “an independent, non-governmental, not for profit, apolitical organization” focused on supporting research and initiatives in drug prevention. He has since served as chairman and currently as trustee for the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentorfoundation.org/people.php?nav%3D3-26-88%26id%3D18 |title=Founder and CEO of EF Education First |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022011207/http://www.mentorfoundation.org/people.php?nav=3-26-88&amp;id=18 |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertil Hult also supports the Bertil Hult Prize. Starting in 2003, the Bertil Hult Prize has been given to a Swedish school once every year, based on their support for dyslexia education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/theroyalfamily/latestnews/2009/crownprincesspresentsbertilhultprize.5.62402a8b12475b47cdb8000664.html|title=Crown Princess presents Bertil Hult Prize - Sveriges Kungahus|website=www.kungahuset.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexi.org/amnen/bertil-hults-pris |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021224217/http://www.dyslexi.org/amnen/bertil-hults-pris |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hult also sponsors the [[Hult International Business School#Hult Prize|Hult Prize]], a USD 1 million award for a global business school case competition run by the Hult International Business School and supported by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hultprize.org|title=Home - Hult Prize|website=Hult Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lately, the Hult family has founded EF's Global Classroom Foundation, which has the goal of helping to rebuild elementary schools in troubled areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishtown.com/online/dp/press_09-08-2011.aspx|title=EF English Live - Learn English Online with EF|website=www.englishtown.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''capital resources, performance and scalability (CPS) model''' is a set of case analysis frameworks recommended by the Global Alliance for Strategy in collaboration with [[European School of Management and Technology]] and is widely used for assessing the sustainability and competitive ability of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;The INSEAD-Wharton Alliance on Globalizing: Strategies for Building Successful Global Businesses, Robert E. Gunther, Hubert Gatignon, John R. Kimberly, {{ISBN|0-521-83571-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==

The CPS model has several published versions, the latest revision being the one developed by Dr. P. V. Lele in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmt.org/eng/consulting/esmt-competition-analysis/ ESMT Competition Analysis – European School of Management and Technology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frameworks ==
The CPS model, in its most popular version, has five frameworks:
* MAN-CHA
* BOSH value
** SAC score
** ENPT score
** Y.U.K.U. Score
* Differential derivation value (DVD) index
* tri-VIN framework
* Technology polarization at normal purchasing power

== Applications and criticism ==

CPS has been very useful in [[consumer durables]] and [[fast-moving consumer goods]] industries. However, the model fails to be effective in [[manufacturing industry]]. 
In several emerging businesses such as software services and [[business process outsourcing]], the DVD index returns a negative value, making the model redundant.

'''Charles Gérard Emmanuel Metz''' (6 January 1799 – 24 April 1853) was a Luxembourgian politician, journalist, and lawyer.  He was a prominent pro-Belgian in the [[Belgian Revolution]], serving in the Belgian national legislature, before entering the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] of Luxembourg, of which he was the first [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President]], from 1848 to 1853.

Charles was born in [[Luxembourg City]] in 1799 to Jean Metz and Anne-Marie-Justine Gérard.  He studied at the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]] and the [[lycée]] in [[Metz]], [[France]], before reading law at the newly established [[University of Liège]], graduating in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Metz first became politically active as a pro-Belgian spokesperson during the [[Belgian Revolution]].  In the [[National Congress of Belgium|National Congress]] called in [[Brussels]], Metz was one of sixteen [[deputy (legislator)|deputies]] representing the [[Arrondissements of Belgium|arrondissement]] of Luxembourg (claimed in its entirety by Belgium).&lt;ref name="Mersch 430"&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, Metz moved to [[Arlon]], where he established a newspaper, ''L'Echo de Luxembourg'', to promote Luxembourgian and liberal interests, along with [[Emmanuel Servais]] and [[Victor Tesch]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 430" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, Metz was elected to the [[Chamber of Representatives of Belgium|Chamber of Representatives]], representing [[Grevenmacher (district)|Grevenmacher]] until 1841.&lt;ref name="Mersch 430" /&gt; He urged the Belgians to enter negotiations with the [[Netherlands]], but spoke against the [[Third Partition of Luxembourg]], ultimately voting against the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 432"&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, he stood for election to the Chamber of Representatives for [[Bastogne]], but lost, remaining as representative of now-partitioned Grevenmacher.&lt;ref name="Mersch 432" /&gt;

Metz, along with his younger brothers [[Auguste Metz|Auguste]] and [[Norbert Metz|Norbert]], establish the steel company ''Auguste Metz &amp; Cie'' in 1838, but he played little active role in its operations.&lt;ref name="Mersch 432" /&gt; Metz was allowed to return to the (smaller) Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to practise law in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of the [[Orangism (Luxembourg)|Orangist]] ''Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg'' in 1844, Metz went about establishing the new ''Courrier de Luxembourg'', along with his brother Norbert and other leading liberals, as well as the conservative [[Orangism (Luxembourg)|Orangist]] [[Mathieu-Lambert Schrobilgen]], with whom the ideological split became more and more apparent over time.&lt;ref name="Mersch 434"&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1848, Metz was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]], being elected to represent the [[Cantons of Luxembourg|cantons]] of [[Esch-sur-Alzette (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Esch]] and [[Luxembourg (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Luxembourg]], but opting to represent the latter.&lt;ref name="Mersch 434" /&gt; The Metz brothers narrowly failed to defer Luxembourg sending a delegation from Luxembourg to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; although their position cost them their potential part in the three-man delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 436–7&lt;/ref&gt; The Metz brothers were elected to the inaugural [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]].  Charles was elected the first [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber]], which he remained until his death on 24 April 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Justine Vannérus on 26 December 1827 in [[Diekirch]].  Vannérus died in 1849, by which time they had seven children, of whom three (Jules, Irma, and Léonie) survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Metz's only son, Jules, followed his father at the ''Courrier'', and then into the Chamber of Deputies for [[Capellen (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Capellen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Léonie married the [[Jersey]]-born engineer [[Edmond Le Gallais]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5550">A '''cryogenic oxygen plant''' is an industrial facility that creates [[molecular oxygen]] at relatively high purity. [[Oxygen]] is the most common [[Chemical element|element]] in the earth's crust&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/elabund.html Abundances of the Elements in the Earth's Crust], Georgia State University&lt;/ref&gt; and the second largest industrial gas. This process was pioneered by [[Carl von Linde|Dr. Carl von Linde]] in 1902.
[[File:LOX80.JPG|thumb|300px|Liquid Oxygen plant with production rate of 80 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour]]

==Purpose==
The cryogenic air separation achieves high purity oxygen of more than 99.5%. The resulting high purity product can be stored as a liquid and/or filled into [[Gas cylinder|cylinders]]. These cylinders can even be distributed to customer in the medical sector, [[welding]] or mixed with other gases and used as breathing gas for [[Scuba diving|diving]].
Typical production ranges from 50  [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]/hour up to 860,000 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour ([[Ras Laffan]] refinery).

==Plant modules==
A cryogenic oxygen plant comprises:

===Warm end (W/E) container===
*[[Gas compressor|Compressor]]
*[[Air receiver]]
*Chiller ([[Heat exchanger]])
*Pre-[[Air filter|filter]]
*[[Air purification unit]] (APU)

===Coldbox===
*Main [[heat exchanger]]
*[[Boiler]]
*[[Fractionating column|Distillation column]]
*Expansion brake [[turbine]]

===Storage===
*[[storage tank|Liquid oxygen tank]]
*Vapouriser
*Filling station

==How the plant works==
[[File:SchemeLOX.jpg|thumb|650px|[[Process flow diagram|Flowsheet]] Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Plant]]

===Warm end process===
Atmospheric air is roughly filtered and pressurised by a compressor, which provides the product pressure to deliver to the customer. The amount of air sucked in depends on the customer’s oxygen demand.

The air receiver collects condensate and minimises pressure drop. The dry and compressed air leaves the air to refrigerant [[heat exchanger]] with about 10°C.

To clean the process air further, there are different stages of [[filtration]]. First of all, more condensate is removed, then a [[Coalescer|coalescing filter]] acts as a gravity filter and finally an [[adsorber]] filled with activated carbon removes some [[hydrocarbon]]s.

The last [[unit process]] in the warm end container is the [[thermal swing adsorber]] (TSA). The Air purification unit cleans the compressed process air by removing any residual water vapour, [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrocarbons]]. It comprises two vessels, valves and exhaust to allow the changeover of vessels. While one of the TSA beds is on stream the second one is regenerated by the waste gas flow, which is vented through a silencer into the ambient environment.

===Coldbox process===
The process air enters the main [[heat exchanger]] in the coldbox where it is cooled in counter flow with the waste gas stream. After leaving the main heat exchanger the process air has a temperature of about –112°C and is partly liquefied. The complete liquefaction is achieved through [[evaporation]] of cooled liquid oxygen in the [[boiler]]. After passing a purity control valve process air enters on tip of the [[Fractionating column|distillation column]] and flows down through the packing material.

The steam of evaporated oxygen vapour in the shell of the boiler vents back into the distillation column. It rises through the column packing material and encounters the descending stream of liquid process air.

The liquid air descending down the column loses [[nitrogen]]. It becomes richer in oxygen and collects at the base of the column as pure [[liquid oxygen]]. It flows out into the boiler to the cold box liquid product valve. An on-line oxygen analyser controls the opening of the liquid product [[valve]] to transfer pure low-pressure liquid oxygen into the [[storage tank]].

The rising oxygen vapour becomes rich in [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]]. It leaves the column and exits the cold box at ambient temperature through the main heat exchanger as a waste gas. This waste  gas provides purge gas to regenerate the TSA unit and to the cool the refrigeration [[turbine]].

Turbines located at the base of the cold box provide refrigeration for the process. A stream of high-pressure gas from the main heat exchangers is cooled and expanded to low pressure in the turbine. This cold air returns to the waste stream of the [[heat exchanger]] to inject refrigeration.
Energy removed by the turbine re-appears as heat in the turbine’s closed-cycle air-brake circuit. This heat is removed in an air-to-air [[Intercooler|cooler]] by waste gas from the cold box.

===Storage and vaporising process===
Liquid from the tank is compressed to high pressure in a cryogenic liquid [[pump]]. It is then vaporised in an ambient air [[evaporator]] to produce gaseous oxygen. The high-pressure gas then can pass into cylinders via the [[Inlet manifold|gas manifold]] or fed into a customers product pipeline.

==Applications==
*[[Furnace]] enrichment
*Medical gases

'''Doron Sabag''' ({{lang-he|דורון סבג}}) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] art patron and a CEO of a big [[human resources]] contractor, O.R.S. ({{lang-he|או.אר.אס.}}) Sabag also runs [[Mehalev]], a controversial Israeli version of "[[Wisconsin]] Plan" in the city of [[Ashkelon]].

In 2002, when he was the head of the Israeli art council, the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' choose Sabag as the most influential person on the Israeli art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.903662 |script-title=he:סליחה, איך מגיעים למוזיאון ישראל |language=he |trans-title=Excuse me, how to get to the Israel Museum? |newspaper=Haaretz |date=12 August 2003 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Minshar]] gallery in Tel Aviv, put on an exhibition named ''Doron'' (Curators: [[Joshua Simon]], [[Roy Arad]] and [[Maayan Strauss]]), which dealt with art and labour rights.

'''Downtown Evansville''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Evansville, Indiana]]. The boundaries of downtown Evansville have changed as the city has grown, but they are generally considered to be between Canal Street at the south and east, the [[Lloyd Expressway]] to the north, [[Pigeon Creek (Indiana)|Pigeon Creek]] to the northwest, and the [[Ohio River]] to the southeast south and southwest. Downtown Evansville is entirely within [[Pigeon Township, Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Pigeon Township]].

The district constitutes Evansville's government, cultural and business center. The [[Evansville Civic Center Complex|Evansville Civic Center]] houses the administrative offices for the city and [[Vanderburgh County]]. [[Berry Plastics]], [[Vectren]], and [[Old National Bank]], the largest financial services bank holding company headquartered in Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Old National Bank Corporate Profile| publisher=SNL Financial| url=http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/corporateprofile.aspx?IID=100391|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; have corporate headquarters in downtown Evansville with [[Mead Johnson]]'s headquarters just west of Downtown.

==History==
Evansville's original downtown plat was made on about 200 acres, with streets running parallel to the river from northwest to southeast. Other streets nearby were laid out on the cardinal points, due north-south and east-west. Thus, anyone entering or leaving downtown finds that the street makes a confusing oblique-angle turn in one direction or another.&lt;ref&gt;Patry, Robert (1996). ''City of Four Freedoms''. Evansville: Friends of Willard Library. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the city suffered from problems such as decreased economic activity and suburban flight, but city-sponsored revitalization has since improved downtown conditions.

==Entertainment venues and attractions==
[[Victory Theatre]] is a vintage 1,950-seat venue that is home to the [[Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra]] and hosts other concerts and events. A wide variety of concerts, plays, and other special events are held at the 2,500-seat auditorium at [[The Centre (Evansville)|The Centre]]. Downtown is also home to the [[Children's Museum of Evansville]], [[Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science|Evansville Museum]], and [[Tropicana Evansville|Tropicana]], with the [[USS LST-325|LST-325 Museum]] located just south of Downtown at the nearby Indiana-Kentucky State Line.   The [[Ford Center (Evansville)|Ford Center]] is a new arena opened in 2011 located near [[The Centre (Evansville)|The Centre]].

The '''Hague–Visby Rules''' is a set of international rules for the international [[Ship transport|carriage of goods by sea]]. They are a slightly updated version of the original [[Hague Rules]] which were drafted in Brussels in 1924.

The premise of the Hague–Visby Rules (and of the earlier English [[common law]] from which the Rules are drawn) was that a carrier typically has far greater [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] than the shipper, and that to protect the interests of the shipper/cargo-owner, the law should impose some minimum [[affreightment]] obligations upon the carrier.  However, the Hague and Hague–Visby Rules were hardly a charter of new protections for cargo-owners; the [[English Law#Common law|English common law]] prior to 1924 provided more protection for cargo-owners, and imposed more liabilities upon "common carriers".&lt;ref&gt;Liver Alkali Company v. Johnson (1874), L.R., 9 Ex. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The official title of the Hague Rules the "International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading". After being amended by the Brussels Amendments (officially the "Protocol to Amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading") in 1968, the Rules became known colloquially as the Hague–Visby Rules.

A final amendment was made in the [[Special drawing rights|SDR]] Protocol in 1979. Many countries declined to adopt the Hague-Visby Rules and stayed with the 1924 Hague Rules.&lt;ref&gt;The Jackson Parton Miscellany, 2nd ed. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other countries which upgraded to Hague-Visby subsequently failed to adopt the 1979 SDR protocol.

==Implementing legislation==
The Hague–Visby Rules were incorporated into English law by the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]]; and English lawyers should note the provisions of the statute as well as the text of the rules. For instance, although Article I(c) of the Rules exempts live animals and deck cargo, section 1(7) restores those items into the category of "goods". Also, although Article III(4) declares a [[bill of lading]] to be a mere "prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods", the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] section 4 upgrades a bill of lading to be "conclusive evidence of receipt".

Under Article X, the Rules apply if ("a) the bill of lading is issued in a contracting State, or (b) the carriage is from a port in a contracting State, or (c) the contract (of carriage) provides that(the) Rules ... are to govern the contract". If the Rules apply, the entire text of Rules is incorporated into the contract of carriage, and any attempt to exclude the Rules is void under Article III (8).

==Carriers' duties==
Under the Rules, the carrier's main duties are to "properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried" and to "exercise [[due diligence]] to ... make the ship seaworthy" and to "... properly man, equip and supply the ship". It is implicit (from the common law) that the carrier must not deviate from the agreed route nor from the usual route; but Article IV(4) provides that "any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of these Rules".

The carrier's duties are not "strict", but require only a reasonable standard of professionalism and care; and Article IV allows the carrier a wide range of situations exempting them from liability on a cargo claim. These exemptions include destruction or damage to the cargo caused by: [[fire]], perils of the sea, [[Act of God]], and act of war.  A controversial provision exempts the carrier from liability for "neglect or default of the master ... in the navigation or in the management of the ship".  This provision is considered unfair to the shipper; and both the later [[Hamburg Rules]] (which require contracting states to denounce the Hague–Visby Rules) and [[Rotterdam Rules]] (which are not yet in force) refuse exemption for negligent navigation and management.

Also, whereas the Hague–Visby Rules require a ship to be seaworthy only "before and at the beginning" of the voyage, under the Rotterdam Rules the carrier will have to keep the ship seaworthy throughout the voyage (although this new duty will be to a reasonable standard that is subject to the circumstances of being at sea).

==Shipper's duties==
By contrast, the shipper has fewer obligations (mostly implicit), namely: (i) to pay freight; (ii) to pack the goods sufficiently for the journey;  (iii) to describe the goods honestly and accurately; (iv) not to ship dangerous cargoes (unless agreed by both parties);   and (v) to have the goods ready for shipment as agreed; (q.v."notice of readiness to load"&lt;ref&gt;The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164&lt;/ref&gt;).  None of these shippers' obligations are enforceable under the Rules; instead they would give rise to a normal action in contract.

==Criticism==
With only 10 Articles, the Rules have the virtue of brevity, but they have several faults. When, after 44 years of experience, the 1924 Rules were updated with a single minor amendment, they still covered only carriage ''wholly'' by sea (thereby ignoring [[multi-modal transport]]), and they barely acknowledged the [[Intermodal container|container]] [[containerization|revolution]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules: Article IV Rule 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/sea.carriage.hague.visby.rules.1968/doc.html#31&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[UNCTAD]] felt that they had actually diluted the protection to shippers once provided by English common law, and proposed instead the more modern [[Hamburg Rules]] of 1978, which were embraced by many developing countries, but largely ignored by ship-operating nations. The modern [[Rotterdam Rules]], with some 96 articles, have far more scope and cover multi-modal transport but remain far from general implementation.

'''Hardline''' is a [[deep ecology]] subculture that has its roots in the [[vegan]] [[straight edge]] [[hardcore punk]] scene.

From an initial founding statement the movement attempted a break with the straight edge and hardcore scenes. The founding statement and subsequent literature pushed a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] view of the world, [[anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] stance and much more extreme version of straight edge. Many hardline bands existed, the most well known of which were [[Vegan Reich]]&lt;ref name=vr/&gt; and [[Raid (band)|Raid]].&lt;ref name=raid/&gt;

==Beliefs==
The hardline philosophy forbids its adherents from smoking or chewing any form of [[tobacco]], drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s, and using illicit [[drug]]s or employing [[medicine]]. Hardliners (as they are called) are expected to follow a strict dietary regimen based on the above-mentioned pillars of respect for innocent life and the "natural order". Hardliners eat only foods that are [[veganism|vegan]] and relatively natural (e.g. brown rice over white, evaporated cane juice over white sugar, organic produce over conventional, natural oils over hydrogenated).  [[Human rights]] issues are also factored into the movement's food politics, and followers are urged to shun third-world [[cash crop]]s such as coffee, chocolate, sugar, and most tropical fruits.  Hardliners include caffeine in their stance on mind-altering drugs so the first two items are generally abstained from, but consumption of the last two is often given more leeway.&lt;ref name=sj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nagia/&gt;

In keeping with its [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] view of the natural order, the sexual politics of the hardline movement are very conservative.  Sex is not allowed except for the reason of procreation; thus [[homosexuality]] is seen as anathema, [[pornography]] and [[masturbation]] is abjured, birth control is avoided, and abortion is militantly opposed.  Although the official hardline stance on sex is that its natural purpose is purely procreative, many hardliners justify recreational sex within the context of committed relationships as potentially procreative by opting not to use birth control.

Hardline has always been highly syncretic (over time absorbing influences from [[Islam]] and a host of other schools of thought) and initially claimed a [[Taoism|Taoist]]&lt;ref name=Muttaqi/&gt; foundation for their sexual morals. This appeal to the orientation of the punk and hardcore scenes met with little success, and the topics of abortion and homosexuality have always been sources of tension between hardliners and their subcultural cousins.&lt;ref name=sj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nagia/&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2013}}
The hardline subculture grew out of the hardcore and hardcore punk scenes in the 1990s.  Although one of the basic tenets of hardline is that it has existed in various forms since the beginning of time, the ideology was largely formulated by Sean Muttaqi of the band Vegan Reich. The hardline philosophy is said to be rooted in one ethic (the sacredness of innocent life), but in reality the ethos rested on that base and on an idea of an immutable natural order.  Hardline can be described as a synthesis of [[deep ecology]], [[straight edge]], [[veganism]] and the [[animal rights movement]].

Hardline began to attract followers shortly after the 1990 release of Vegan Reich's ''Hardline'' EP and the official founding of the subculture.  Other bands soon formed; the most notable of them being Raid from Tennessee.

Sean Muttaqi, as editor of the zine ''Vanguard'' (hardline's official press organ), was able to exert ideological influence on the movement, and caused the center of its activities to become shifted to Tennessee.  Many in the Memphis hardcore scene adopted Hardline stances and started editing magazines, organizing protests, engaging in direct action against industries that exploited animals, and otherwise acting on their new beliefs. Some of the most notable achievements of Memphis Hardline were organizing the movement's first annual gathering and founding the long-standing [[Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade]] (CAFT).

Things began to fade in Memphis. Muttaqi left for [[Jamaica]] to explore [[Rastafari]] and decided to leave the hardcore scene along with hardline altogether. Editing was transferred of ''Vanguard''. 

Hardliners were instrumental in CAFT, the [[Animal Defense League]], and Vegans For Life.  Some were also involved in [[Earth First!]], [[anti-imperialist]] organizations, and other leftist causes and groups.

Some Hardliners from Massachusetts set out to establish an intentional community in Hawaii. The effort quickly failed due to personality conflicts (especially the ongoing debate among group members as to whether or not cooked food was natural enough) and a distinct lack of required agricultural and engineering skills.  In an ironic coincidence, this self-defeating arc reflects tensions in similarly idealistic communes of the 1960s and 1970s during the [[History of the hippie movement]] and the [[back-to-the-land movement]].

Hardline was undoubtedly heavily inspired from its inception by straight edge.  The original logo of the movement was an outline of a large "X" (the sign most often associated with straightedge) with two crossed [[M16 rifle]]s inside it. Muttaqi has said that he was first exposed to the idea of fusing veganism and abstinence from drugs by an English punk named Rat. Rat had allegedly coined the term "vegan straight edge" by the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, Rat was doing little to spread his ideology while Muttaqi was transforming and propagating it. Vegan Reich was for many in the hardcore scene their first exposure to ideas about militant animal liberation, and the controversy they aroused drew considerable attention to their positions.  Those in the subculture who gravitated toward animal-related causes but disagreed with some of hardline's finer points found themselves becoming vegan straightedge. Vegan straightedge band [[Earth Crisis]] initially wanted Muttaqi to release their debut EP, ''All Out War'' on his record label, [[Uprising Records]].

As hardline came into its own, many hardliners decided that their philosophy was so beyond the narrow scene politics of straightedge that the two were entirely different things. The "X" was removed from the crossed rifles logo, straightedge was harshly criticized, and hardliners were encouraged to leave the hardcore scene.  Much of this sprang from the momentum being gained by the more activist-oriented elements within the subculture.  Eventually hardliners came to consider their network wholly divorced from the hardcore scene. However, the nature of information dissemination in a mostly pre-Internet media environment made recruiting from outside the hardcore subculture next to impossible.  Although hardline served to involve people heavily in political activity, the overwhelming bulk of new members were straight-edgers who would with time come to identify primarily as activists instead of hardcore kids.

In mid-1998 the subculture experienced a massive internal upheaval as Indianapolis Hardline member David Agranoff's attempts to weaken Hardline were sidelined by Boston Hardline. ''Vanguard'' number eight announced the reorganization of the movement under the authority of the newly created Hardline Central Committee (HCC) and castigated Agranoff and his comrades for softening the network's ideology through their refinement and development of it.  This proved a wise decision as Agranoff later became a police informer. Chapters were instructed to report to the Committee for evaluation and were told in no uncertain terms that they would not be recognized as cells until they submitted to this review.  Also in the issue was a document about the stages through which the Hardline revolution would progress which was presented as being from 1990, but had never before been seen and was suspiciously contemporary feeling.

Some chapters opted to leave hardline entirely and instead established a new activist network called Education For A Sustainable Future (ESF).  ESF differed from its predecessor in that it took no stances.&lt;ref name=Muttaqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muttaqi2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muttaqi3/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvnb|Pike|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''Institute of Management Accountants'''  ('''IMA''') is a [[professional organization|professional membership organization]] headquartered in [[Montvale, New Jersey]], United States, operating in four global regions: The Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Middle East/India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New ACCA and IMA Survey: US Leads The Way In Economic Confidence in Q2 2018 |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-acca-and-ima-survey-us-leads-the-way-in-economic-confidence-in-q2-2018-north-america-most-confident-region-in-the-world-300680008.html |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=PR Newswire |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IMA members are represented in 140 countries around the world with 300 professional and student chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IMA Looks Ahead To A Time Of Transition |url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/ima-looks-ahead-to-a-time-of-transition?utm_content=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=accountingtoday-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;regconf=1 |publisher=Accounting Today |date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members work in business, with job responsibilities distinct from those in [[public accounting]]. IMA raises awareness of management accounting, which includes jobs in decision support, planning and control positions.

With a global network of more than 100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Going Global The Key To Growing Membership? |url=https://associationsnow.com/2018/02/going-global-growing-membership-institute-management-accountants/ |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Associations Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; professionals, IMA provides [[certification]], the [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), for internal [[financial management]] responsibilities, including [[planning]], [[budgeting]], [[business reporting]], decision analysis and [[risk management]]. 

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (ICMA), the certification division of IMA, awards the [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA) certification. The skills included in the curriculum for the CMA include strategic management, reporting and control, technology and analytics, leadership, business acumen and operations, and professional values and ethics. At IMA's recent annual conference in Indianapolis, the organization unveiled an exposure draft of an enhanced competency framework for skills management accountants will need to stay relevant in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IMA Releases Management Accounting Competency Framework at Conference |url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/ima-releases-management-accounting-competency-framework |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Accounting Today |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CMA is a well-recognized certification among employers. In its latest salary survey, IMA finds the median income for CMAs is about 28% higher in the U.S. than for their peers without the designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5 Accounting and Finance Certifications To Get Ahead |url=https://www.business.com/articles/best-accounting-finance-certifications/ |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Business.com |date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally the survey finds CMAs earn 62% more in median salary and 67% more in median total compensation than non-CMAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Management Accountants Seeing Pay Raises |url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/management-accountants-seeing-pay-raises-especially-with-the-cma |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Accounting Today |date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMAs are well-represented within Fortune 500 companies as the certification is especially relevant to larger companies. CMAs hold titles such as Controller and CFO across industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Does the Big Four Value The CMA Certification? |url=https://goingconcern.com/big-4-cma-gleim-gp-sponcon/ |publisher=Going Concern.com |date=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jose Juan Garcia''' a.k.a. '''CheJuan''' (October 22, 1940 – December 17, 2002) was the founder of the international institution called [[Hogares Crea]].

==Early years==
Garcia was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico]] where he was raised by his parents. He had a tough childhood and experienced his first imprisonment when he was 15 years old. At a very young age, he became a drug addict and stole in order to pay for his habit.  He went to prison more than once because of his drug problems. However, he was fortunate enough to have met some people who would have a positive influence in his live and change it  forever, among them was the educator [[Ana G. Mendez]]. He also attributed his acceptance of "[[Christ]]" as a reason for his change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblesociety.org/sr_19/sr_19.htm#Drug Center Drug Center Biblesociety]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Hogares Crea"==
In 1968, Garcia founded in [[Puerto Rico]] "Hogares Crea".  The word "Crea" stands for the re-education of the addict and the community. Those who enter the program do not have to pay a fee, but, must agree to the programs strict rules. Breaking a drug habit is not easy and those who enter the program must adopt new habits which are conductive to recovery. They must go to church on Sundays and sell caramel custards and garbage bags door to door. They also must wash cars and do community services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n28/HogarCrea-en.html Puerto Rico Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203736/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n28/HogarCrea-en.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia's program is not financed by the government.  [[Physician|Doctor]]s, [[psychologist]]s and others donate their time. Expenses are covered by the volunteer board of each home. Each home has enough beds for 15 people. 28 thousand people have successfully completed the program, out of 51 thousand addicts who have been treated in 36 years. In is estimated that 92% of those who have completed the program started by Garcia, have completely stayed out of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.gov/newsletter/archive/02-23-06_e-newsletter.htm HOGAR CREA DELIVERS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO RECOVERY]&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia's Hogares Crea have over 152 facilities worldwide. Some of the other countries besides Puerto Rico, where Hogares Crea are established are: the [[United States]], [[Dominican Republic]],  [[Costa Rica]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n52/HogarCrea-en.html Hogar CREA: A Struggle To Stay Clean, To Save Souls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognitions==
Among the awards and recognitions he received are:
* The Citizen of the Year in 1974, Granted by the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association
* Citizen of the Year 1976, by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce
* An award from [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] and others for the exemplary community service offered by Hogar CREA in the United States.
* The [[Government of Puerto Rico]] named a plaza in Rio Piedras "Plaza Jose Juan "Cheguan" Garcia".

==Later years==
Jose Juan Garcia died on December 22, 2002 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] from [[cancer]].  His son Javier Garcia and his widow Flora Rosario Johnson were involved in a dispute over the control of the organization. The organizations current director is Benjamin Pintor Miranda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexjuris.com/lexlex/lex97133.htm Public Law #133] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022051854/http://www.lexjuris.com/lexlex/lex97133.htm |date=2006-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2009 Cochrane became Group Chief Executive of [[Weir Group]] plc, having joined Weir as Group Finance Director in July 2006. He resigned as a director of Weir Group on 30 September 2016.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/krm0AUimqKgzdp2qRmHczhQBKFw/appointments |title=Keith Robertson Cochrane|publisher=[[Companies House]]|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane said that he was "looking for the next opportunity" and that the Weir Group had become "a bit samey".&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Cochrane handed £770,000 to walk from Weir|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/company_news/15153650.Keith_Cochrane_handed___770_000_to_walk_from_Weir/|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cochrane was appointed as the lead "non-executive director” for the Scotland Office and Office of the Advocate General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15886349.Revealed__Carillion_boss_helps_Mundell_run_the_Scotland_Office/|title=David Mundell urged to drop Carillion interim chief executive as Scotland Office adviser|publisher=The Herald|date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochrane was appointed to the board of [[Carillion]] plc on 2 July 2015 and on 10 July 2017 he became its Interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/07/10/carillions-new-boss-promises-aggressive-plan-get-back-track/|title=Carillion's new boss promises 'aggressive' plan to get back on track|publisher=The Telegraph|date=10 July 2017|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in this position until the company went into [[Liquidation|voluntary liquidation]] on 15 January 2018.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Carillion to go into liquidation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42687032#|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, published on 16 May 2018, the Carillion board was described as "either negligently ignorant of the rotten culture at Carillion or complicit in it."&lt;ref name="Carillion report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=88|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report continued:
:"Keith Cochrane was an inside appointment as interim Chief Executive, having served as a non-executive on the board that exhibited little challenge or insight. He was unable to convince investors of his ability to lead and rebuild the company. ... Non-executives are there to scrutinise executive management. They have a particularly vital role in challenging risk management and strategy and should act as a bulwark against reckless executives. Carillion’s NEDs were, however, unable to provide any remotely convincing evidence of their effective impact."&lt;ref name="Carillion report"/&gt;

The report also recommended that the [[Insolvency Service]] should consider whether the former Carillion directors, including Cochrane, could be disqualified from acting as a director.&lt;ref name="Carillion report recommendation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=93|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4748">{{about|the form of bribery||Kickback (disambiguation)}}
A '''kickback''' is a form of negotiated [[bribery]] in which a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] is paid to the bribe-taker in exchange for services rendered. Generally speaking, the remuneration (money, goods, or services handed over) is negotiated ahead of time.  The kickback varies from other kinds of bribes in that there is implied [[collusion]] between agents of the two parties, rather than one party [[Extortion|extorting]] the bribe from the other.&lt;ref name="Wrage14"&gt;Wrage, Alexandra Addison. ''Bribery and Extortion: Undermining Business, Governments, and Security.'' Westport, Conn.: Praeger Security International, 2007. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the kickback is usually to encourage the other party to cooperate in the illegal scheme.&lt;ref name="Kran387"&gt;Kranacher, Riley, and Wells, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "kickback" comes from [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] [[English language]], and describes the way a recipient of illegal gain "kicks back" a portion of it to another person for that person's assistance in obtaining it.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;Campos, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and methods==
The most common form of kickback involves a vendor submitting a [[fraudulent]] or inflated invoice (often for goods or services which were not needed, of inferior quality, or both), with an employee of the victim company assisting in securing payment. For his or her assistance in securing payment, the individual receives some sort of payment (cash, goods, services) or favor (the hiring of a relative, employment, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Albrecht, Albrecht, and Zimbelman, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kickback brokers" are individuals who may not receive the kickback personally, but who help link the individual or company providing the goods or services with individuals capable of assisting with the illegal payments.  For helping to link the two colluding parties, either or both parties may make a payment to this "broker".&lt;ref&gt;Campos, p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
Kickbacks are one of the most common forms of government corruption.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt; In some cases, the kickback takes the form of a "cut of the action," and can be so well known as to be common knowledge—and even become part of a nation's culture.  For example, in [[Indonesia]], [[President Suharto]] was publicly known as "Mr. Twenty-Five Percent" because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation provide him with 25 percent of the income before he would approve the contract. And, in [[Pakistan]], [[President Asif Ali Zardari]] was publicly known as "Mr. Ten Percent" for the same reason, which later became hundred percent. After coming into the government, he started taking 10% of all major contract investments before he would approve the contract.&lt;ref name="Wrage14" /&gt; However, kickbacks differ from other forms of corruption, such as diversion of assets, as in [[embezzlement]], because of the collusion between two parties.&lt;ref name="Kran387" /&gt;

Kickback schemes can be pervasive.  For example, in the [[United States]], companies providing medical services to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients were paying doctors to send patients to them, whether the patient needed the treatment, diagnosis, or test or not.  In 1987, the [[United States Congress]] passed the stringent [[Anti-Kickback Act]] to prevent such schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Buchbinder and Shanks, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the political scene was realigned dramatically by the ''[[Mani pulite|Tangentopoli]]'' scandals in the 1990s, which uncovered widespread use of kickbacks in the national and local governments.

The '''legal working age''' is the minimum age required by [[law]] for a person to work, in each [[country]] or [[jurisdiction]].

Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the [[age of majority]]. Activities that are dangerous, [[harmful]] to the [[health]] or that may affect the [[morals]] of [[Minor (law)|minors]] fall into this category.

Group Captain '''Sir Louis Leisler Greig''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (17 November 1880 – 1 March 1953) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]], [[rugby union|rugby]] player, [[courtier]] and intimate of [[King]] [[George VI]].

==Rugby union==
Greig was a successful rugby player, and was capped for {{nrut|Scotland}} and the [[British and Irish Lions]] when they took their [[1903 British Lions tour to South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Bath1&gt;Bath, p117&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in all three tests against {{nrut|South Africa}} as well as some of the provincial matches.

==Biography==
The son of a [[Glasgow]] merchant and the founding chair of the [[Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage]], Greig was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and [[Merchiston Castle School]] before studying medicine at [[Glasgow University]]. Academically gifted, Greig was also an excellent [[rugby union]] and [[tennis]] player. After a few years practicing as a junior doctor in the [[Gorbals]], he joined the navy in 1906 and won the gold medal during his training at [[Royal Hospital Haslar|Haslar]].

In 1909, Greig entered officer training at the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], where he met Prince Albert, later [[George VI]]. He lived at [[Thatched House Lodge]] at the time. He served as a mentor for the gauche and diffident prince, and the two served together in [[HMS Cumberland (1902)|HMS ''Cumberland'']], where he was posted as a surgeon. He was transferred to the [[Royal Marines]] in 1914, and was captured at the fall of [[Antwerp]], spending eight months as a [[prisoner of war]]. Earlier his elder brother Robert C Greig of Capelrig, Renfrewshire had founded the firm of RC Greig stockbrokers of Glasgow and London, and his elder sister Constance had married John Scrimgeour, stockbroker in London.&lt;ref name=Bath1&gt;Bath, p117&lt;/ref&gt;

Released by a prisoner exchange, Greig married Phyllis Scrimgeour on 16 February 1916, by whom he had three children:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blgweb.thomastechsolutions.com/images/greigfamilytree1.gif|title=Greig Family Tree|accessdate=7 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bridget Greig (b. 1917), married Sir [[Buchan-Hepburn baronets|Ninian Buchan-Hepburn, 6th Baronet]] in 1958
*Jean Greig (1920–1973), married [[Joseph Cooper (broadcaster)|Joseph Cooper]] in 1947
*Captain Sir [[Henry Louis Carron Greig|(Henry Louis) Carron Greig]], KCVO, CBE, DL (b. 21 February 1925), a businessman and ship broker, [[Gentleman Usher]] in Ordinary to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] from 1961–1995;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Richard|title=They also serve, who only ush|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/they-also-serve-who-only-ush-why-is-the-queen-followed-by-people-in-antique-clothes-richard-tomlinson-on-the-lords-ladies-women-masters-silver-sticks-and-white-staves-at-court-1564751.html|newspaper=Independent|date=20 Dec 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; he married Monica Stourton in 1955; the couple has three sons, one of whom, Louis Stourton Greig (born 1956), served as [[Page of Honour]] to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], as well as a daughter.

Greig joined the company of [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']] in June 1917, rejoining Prince Albert, and helped cure the prince of the severe [[peptic ulcer]]s from which he suffered. During the next seven years, he was extensively in attendance on the Prince, receiving an appointment as an [[equerry]] to the Prince in 1918. Prince Albert and his Equerry both joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1919 (Greig rising to the rank of [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]), and the two were partners at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], an event which brought Greig's influence with the Prince into public light.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

He continued to mentor and advise the Prince (created [[Duke of York]], 1920), acting as a surrogate father and encouraging his social life. He encouraged the Duke of York's courtship of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], which was ultimately to have significant consequences for Greig's relations with the Duke. While he was made a [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (26 April 1923) for his services, Elizabeth, as Duchess of York, gradually displaced him as an intimate of the Duke. Ultimately, Greig was omitted from a royal tour of the [[Balkan]]s and consequently resigned his equerryship. However, he was created a [[Gentleman Usher]] in Ordinary on 1 March 1924. Greig's subsequent life was uneventful. He successfully joined J&amp;A Scrimgeour (a firm connected with his wife) as a [[stockbroker]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

He went into a brief eclipse under King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], who disliked him, and resigned his ushership on 21 July 1936. However, upon the accession of his George VI, he was appointed an Extra Gentleman Usher (1 March 1937), and was also elected chairman of Wimbledon. He rejoined the RAF in 1939, serving as a liaison with the [[Air Ministry]] and reaching the rank of [[group captain]]. He was operated on for cancer in 1952, but succumbed in early 1953 and was buried in [[Ham, Surrey]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Political activities==
Greig was a member of the [[January Club]], an establishment [[ginger group]] for the [[British Union of Fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;[[MI5]] report, 1 August 1934, PRO HO 144/20144/110, cited in {{cite thesis|type=MA|last=Keele|first=Thomas Norman|date=1998|title=Blackshirts Torn: Inside the British Union of Fascists, 1932–1940|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]|page=26|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/tape17/PQDD_0026/MQ37564.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resistance to fascism|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyeve23.htm|website=Glasgow Digital Library|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a stockbroker he formed a friendship with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Greig played a small role in the formation of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931, and was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] on 3 June 1932, in which year he was also appointed Deputy Ranger of [[Richmond Park]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Bush] - website of [[The White House]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Luis Alberto Ferré-Aguayo''' (February 17, 1904{{spaced ndash}} October 21, 2003) was a Puerto Rican engineer, [[industrialist]], politician, philanthropist, and a patron of the arts. He was the third [[Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]], serving from 1969 to 1973. He was the founding father of the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]], which advocates for [[Puerto Rico]] to become a state of the United States of America. He is a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

[[File:Don Luis A. Ferré.jpg|thumb|Hand-etched portrait over black granite by artist Osvaldo Torres at Cruzacalles, Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.]]

==Early life==
Luis Alberto Ferré-Aguayo was born in the southern city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]] on February 17, 1904. Ferré's grandfather Maurice Ferré Perotín was a French engineer who was involved in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] before settling in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; Ferre's father, Antonio Ferré Bagayado or "Bacallao", was born in [[Havana]], Cuba and grew up there.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWniCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Luis+Alberto+Ferr%C3%A9+Aguayo++grandfather+french&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilycrRjezTAhULCcAKHcUHAmoQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Luis%20Alberto%20Ferr%C3%A9%20Aguayo%20%20grandfather%20french&amp;f=false Memoir] By Rosario Ferré&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he immigrated to Puerto Rico, where he founded the company [[Puerto Rico Iron Works]], in Barrio [[Playa (Ponce)|Playa de Ponce]], Ponce, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/ferre-1029.html|title=Luis Ferré, former governor and Corporation member|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=October 29, 2003|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elboricua.com/PresidentialMedalofFreedom.html Puerto Rico Iron Works]&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico  Ferré met and married María Aguayo Casals, a cousin of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cellist [[Pablo Casals]], [[Pilar Defilló Amiguet|whose mother]] was a Puerto Rico-born Catalan musician.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; Antonio and María had four sons, Luis, [[José Ferré|José]], Carlos and Hermán Ferré, and two daughters, Rosario and [[Isolina Ferré|Isolina]], this latter would became a nun of international prominence.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

Ferré studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1924 and master's degree in 1925, and music at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/luis-ferre-obituary.htm|title=Former Puerto Rican Gov. Luis A. Ferré dies|publisher=The Miami Herald|date=October 22, 2003|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time while living in Boston, Ferré developed an admiration for the "American way of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/americas/10/21/obit.ferre.ap/|title=Luis Ferre, prominent Puerto Rican figure, dies|publisher=CNN|date=October 21, 2003|accessdate=October 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412032809/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/americas/10/21/obit.ferre.ap/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialist==
Upon his return to [[Puerto Rico]], Ferré helped transform his father's company into a successful business from which he earned a fortune. In 1948, he acquired ''[[El Nuevo Día|El Día]],'' a fledgling newspaper that was later renamed ''El Nuevo Día,'' becoming the newspaper with the largest circulation in Puerto Rico at the time. In the 1950s, Ferré's ''Empresas Ferré'' (Ferre Enterprises) acquired Puerto Rico Cement and [[Ponce Cement]], which capitalized on the economic boom which Puerto Rico enjoyed based on the ambitious industrialization projects undertaken in association with the [[Operation Bootstrap]]. Ferré's  brother, José, had moved to Miami with his family. His son [[Maurice Ferré|Maurice]] expanded a successful business there, selling bagged pre-mixed cement and sand under the name Mezcla Lista. Maurice Ferré was elected Mayor of Miami.

==Political life==
Ferré became active in politics in the 1940s. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Ponce in 1940 and [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]] in 1948.

===Representative===
In 1948, Puerto Ricans were allowed to elect their governor; previously the position was filled by appointment by the United States president. [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] was elected governor of Puerto Rico. A movement began which aimed to adopt a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] relationship with the United States of America. In 1951, a [[referendum]] was held to decide whether to approve or not the option granted by the [[United States Congress]] to draft Puerto Rico's first constitution.  Ferré abstained from participating in the process; the pro-statehood party to which he belonged favored the 1951 [[referendum]]. He believed that the process would mean "an acceptance of a colony and condemn the people to a perpetual condition of second class citizenship". Ferré later participated in the constitutional assembly created by the [[referendum]], which drafted the constitution.&lt;ref name="Univision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=3&amp;schid=0&amp;secid=0&amp;cid=281161|title=Falleció el ex gobernador Luis A. Ferré|date=October 22, 2003|publisher=Univision|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109151741/http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=3&amp;schid=0&amp;secid=0&amp;cid=281161|archivedate=November 9, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was adopted, renaming the body politic of the territory of Puerto Rico as the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]]. Ferré was elected as a member of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|Constitutional Assembly]]. That same year Ferré was elected representative in the [[Puerto Rico]] House of Representatives. He ran under the [[Republican Statehood Party]] ("Partido Estadista Republicano) and officially assumed his duties as representative on January 11, 1953.

===Governor and Senator===
On July 23, 1967, a [[plebiscite]] was held to decide if the people of [[Puerto Rico]] desired to become an independent nation, a state of the United States of America, or continue the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] relation established in 1952. The majority of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]] opted for the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] option (see [[Puerto Rican status referendums]]). Disagreement among the current pro-statehood party led by [[Miguel A. García Méndez]] led Ferré and others to found the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] or [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|PNP]].

In the following general election in 1968, Ferré ran for [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] and defeated Luis Negrón López, the candidate of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] (PPD) by a slight margin. The ruling party had split with the creation of the [[People's Party (Puerto Rico)|People's Party]], which ran incumbent PDP-elected Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella as its gubernatorial candidate,  ending [[Luis Muñoz Marín]]'s PPD's hold on the governor's seat, which had lasted 20 years.

During Ferré's administration, Puerto Rico was in an economic boom at 7% GDP Growth and the unemployment at 10%, the lowest until 1999. His work as governor of Puerto Rico included defending the federal minimum wage and granting workers a Christmas bonus. He visited [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] troops in [[Vietnam]]. In 1970, his first wife, Lorencita, died at La Fortaleza after being bed-ridden for years. Their daughter, [[Rosario Ferré]], an acclaimed novelist and writer, stepped into the role of [[First Lady]].

During his governorship, he paid special attention to youth affairs and bringing young Puerto Ricans into public service.  He successfully had the Puerto Rico Constitution amended to lower the voting age to 18, strongly supported the New Progressive Party Youth organization as party president, and appointed then-young statehooders such as [[Antonio Quiñones Calderón]] and [[Francisco "Pompi" González]] to high-level administration jobs, campaigned for a 26-year-old at large House candidate, nominated a future Senate President and Secretary of State, teenager [[Kenneth McClintock]] as Puerto Rico delegate to the 1971 [[White House Conference on Youth]], and strengthened college scholarship programs.

Before the Congress created the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1971, Ferré had already created Puerto Rico's [[Environmental Quality Board]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gobierno.pr/JCA/Inicio/&lt;/ref&gt; charged with protecting the islands' environment.

In the elections of 1972 he sought reelection but lost to [[Rafael Hernández Colón]] of the PPD.  The PPD had claimed that many corruption scandals (rather minor compared to similar ones in the various administrations following Ferré's) had been overlooked by the Ferré administration. A bloody student strike at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras]] in 1971 had been neutralized by the Puerto Rican police using brute force, something about which Ferré had mixed feelings. Hernández played the youth card in his campaign (when elected he was the youngest Puerto Rican governor). All these issues, along with the reunification of the People's Party and the PDP, contributed to a PDP win over Ferré in the election.

Ferré remained active in politics and in 1976, he was elected to the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]]. Ferré served as the eighth president of the Senate from 1977 to 1981 and continued serving as senator until 1985.

Years after leaving La Fortaleza, he married Tiody De Jesús, a nurse who later became a physician.

After serving as senator, Ferré continued to be active in politics, especially representing the [[United States Republican Party]] on the island. Between 1989 and 1991, Ferré served with former Governor [[Carlos Romero Barceló]], former representative [[Benny Frankie Cerezo]], PNP leader [[Kenneth McClintock]] and former congressional staffer [[David Gerken]] as the New Progressive Party's negotiating team while Congress considered Puerto Rico political status legislation introduced by Senator [[J. Bennett Johnston]].

==Renaissance man==

Ferré was also a talented pianist who recorded several albums of his piano music. On January 3, 1959 he founded the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], in his hometown of Ponce.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/obituaries/22FERR.html?ex=1382241600&amp;en=dce8bfcd789466ca&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND|title=Luis A. Ferré, Who Pushed Puerto Rican Statehood, Dies at 99|author=Douglas Martin|work=The New York Times|date=October 22, 2003|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum initially displayed 71 paintings from his personal collection and today displays over 3,000 pieces. Among other things, Ferré is credited with having rescued from oblivion the painting ''[[Flaming June]]'' by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter [[Frederic Lord Leighton]] – purchasing it in 1963, when it was considered "too old fashioned" and getting it prominently displayed at the Museo of Arte de Ponce.

"El Centro de Bellas Artes", the center for performing arts in [[Santurce, Puerto Rico]] also bears his name, as well as the main highway connecting San Juan and Ponce. He also assisted in the creation of the [[Casals Festival]]  and the [[Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music]]. He was a member of [[Phi Sigma Alpha]] Fraternity. As a sportsman, Ferré practiced fencing, and is honored annually with the "Campeonato Nacional de Esgrima" in Puerto Rico.

His philanthropic deeds and defense for democracy earned him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], awarded by President [[George H. W. Bush]] on November 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031022.html|title=Statement on Don Luis Ferre|author=George W. Bush|publisher=The White House|date=October 22, 2003|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Luis A. Ferre sculpture.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture of Ferré inside the [[Capitol of Puerto Rico]]]]
On September 29, 2003, Ferré was hospitalized with a [[urinary tract infection]] and underwent surgery for an [[intestine|intestinal blockage]] on October 1. While in the hospital he developed [[pneumonia]] before finally succumbing to [[respiratory failure]] on the morning of October 21, 2003.

His body lay in state in Puerto Rico's capitol building in San Juan, then transported to his museum in Ponce, before being taken for a state funeral and burial in that city. His funeral and ceremonies honoring him were attended by numerous politicians. He is interred at the Las Mercedes Cemetery in Ponce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsuralavista.com/periodico/?p=34766 ''Conmemoran Natalicio de Don Luis A. Ferré Aguayo.''] February 22, 2011. El Sur a la Vista. Ponce, Puerto Rico. Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the awards that were bestowed on Luis A. Ferré was the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], an honor which was also subsequently bestowed on his sister [[Sor Isolina Ferre]].  The sculptor [[Tomás Batista]] was also commissioned to make a bust of Ferré, which is exhibited in the [[Ponce Museum of Art]].  Another [[Tomás Batista]] bust of him was unveiled by his widow, Tiody, Senate President [[Kenneth McClintock]] and Senate Vice President [[Orlando Parga]] in February, 2008 at the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]]'s Hall of Governors.

In 2003 the historic United States Courthouse and Post Office Building in Ponce, Puerto Rico was named the [[Luis A. Ferré United States Courthouse and Post Office Building]] by an Act of the U.S. Congress.

The segment of [[PR-163|Las Américas Avenue]] that includes the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico]] was renamed the ''Luis A. Ferré Boulevard'' in November, 2010, in his honor.

'''Mauro Casagrandi''' (born [[San Salvador]], 1939) is an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman based in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].

With a right-wing [[Italy|Italian]] diplomat as a father, he lived in Central America and other countries during his childhood.  He moved to [[Cuba]] in 1961 shortly after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], intending to represent leading Italian companies including [[FIAT]] and [[Olivetti]].  A knight of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], he  became the Order's Ambassador to [[Cuba]].

During his overseas travels, he was allegedly approached by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], who hoped to use him to gather insider information about [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]].  He accepted the offer in [[Spain]] in 1975, but intending instead to benefit the [[Cuba]]n government, which he supported.  He therefore became a [[double agent]] of the [[Cuba]]n regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubavsterrorismo.cu/interface.sp/uploads/libros/libro01.pdf|title=Mauro Casagrandi double agent for Cuba, page 170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s however, he started becoming disillusioned with the [[Cuba]]n ideology.  Many observers believe that he was related to the leak of the classified documents related to the purge of the [[Centre for American Studies (CEA)|Centro de Estudios Sobre América]].

=== Political career ===
From 2002 until 2006 Korolevska was a deputy of the [[Luhansk]] regional parliament. During the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Presidential election 2004]] she supported [[Victor Yanukovich]].&lt;ref name="gazeta"&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://www.gpu.ua/index.php?&amp;id=154882 Народна депутатка з Луганська від БЮТу раніше підтримувала Віктора Януковича], Gazeta.ua (March 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://kontrakty.com.ua/show/ukr/print_article/9195/2920079195.html Спецпроект «Невідома Україна».

Korolevska became a member of [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] (a part of [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]]) in autumn 2005 because "she is sure that the block of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] is the future".&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt; Korolevska decided to enter national politics: "I knew the most complex problems of the [[Donbass]] and sincerely wanted to solve them, but saw and understood that it is impossible to do so at the level of the regional council. It is in this spirit that I arrived in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) in 2006. Disappointment came quickly enough: it seems that everyone here is well aware of the difficulties, but nobody makes an attempt resolve them and to help the people."&lt;ref name=March10&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://vvnews.info/article.aspx?a=20719 Наталья Королевская: «У нас в семье патриархат»]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, VV news (March 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006]] and [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|2007]] parliamentary elections, she was elected as a deputy to the Verkhovna Rada.

In order to finance his higher studies, he worked as a principal at the [[Lafayette, Colorado|Lafayette]] High School during 1919–1920. His economics professor helped him get a scholarship at [[Columbia University]]. His friend Wilford White suggested he go to Harvard instead, an idea supported by the University's dean.&lt;ref name="JPW_1963"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leaders in Marketing: Neil H. Borden |author=James Playsted Wood |journal=Journal of Marketing |date=January 1963 |volume=27 |issue=1 |url=https://archive.ama.org/archive/ResourceLibrary/JournalofMarketing/Pages/1963/27/1/6740720.aspx |pages=75–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== At Harvard ==

Borden studied business administration at Harvard during 1920–1922. During this time, he earned money through an assistantship and as the bookkeeper of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. An exceptional student, he was made an assistant [[dean (education)|dean]] when he obtained his MBA degree in 1922. He did not hold a doctorate. He started teaching marketing under Melvin T. Copeland, and succeeded [[Daniel Starch]] as the teacher of advertising in 1925. He served as an assistant professor during 1925–1928. During this period, [[Arch Wilkinson Shaw]] helped him raise $60,000 for research. The research was published in form of ''Problems in Advertising'', a book of advertising case studies, in 1927. The [[case study]] method was the basis of Borden's teaching style.&lt;ref name="JPW_1963"/&gt;

Borden next served as an associate professor during 1928–1938, before becoming a professor in 1938. During the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the advertisers, such as Louis H. Weld of [[McCann Erickson]], requested Harvard academics for an objective analysis of advertising's economic impact. Borden was selected to write a book on the topic, supported by a grant of $30,000 from the wife of Alfred W. Erickson. To accomplish this objective, Borden worked with an advisory committee of academic fellows and the [[Advertising Research Foundation]]. Several businesses and advertising agencies contributed material to his research. He took a leave of six months to focus on the book, when his teaching began to suffer. The 970-page book, ''The Economic Effects of Advertising'', was published in January 1942.&lt;ref name="JPW_1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAF_HoF"/&gt;

Borden served as the President of the National Association of Marketing Teachers, and also as the national President (1953–1954) of its successor organization, the [[American Marketing Association]]. During 1956–1962, he was the chairman of the [[Harvard Business Review]] board. He retired from teaching in 1962, and focused on writing.&lt;ref name="JPW_1963"/&gt;

==The marketing mix==

During the 1940s, the discipline of marketing was in transition. Interest in the functional school of thought, which was primarily concerned with the functions of marketing was waning while the managerial school of thought, which focussed on the problems and challenges confronting marketers was gaining ground.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander, Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-37, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constantinides"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=E. Constantinides | title=The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing | journal=Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 | year= 2006 | pages= 407–438| url= http://intranet.fucape.br/uploads/MATERIAIS_AULAS/25112-8.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of marketers as "mixers of ingredients," first introduced by James Culliton, one of Borden's colleagues at Harvard, had gained some currency amongst scholars who debated, what elements should be considered as part of the set of ingredients. Many scholars and practitioners relied on checklists or lengthy classifications of factors that needed to be considered to understand consumer responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=W. Waterschoo | author2=C. van den Bulte | title=The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | journal=Journal of Marketing | volume=56 | number=4 | year=1992  | pages=83–93 | jstor= 1251988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden himself developed a complicated model in the late 1940s, based upon at least twelve different factors.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2830600254.html | work=Overview: Marketing Mix: Product, Price, Place, Promotion |date=January 1, 2008 | title=Everyday Finance: Economics, Personal Money Management, and Entrepreneurship }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, Borden published a retrospective article detailing the early history of the marketing mix in which he claims that he was inspired by Culliton's idea of 'mixers', and credits himself with coining the term, 'marketing mix'.&lt;ref&gt;Borden, N.H., "The Concept of the Marketing Mix,"  ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 1964, pp 2-7 and reprinted in: Baker, M.J. (ed), ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management'', Vol. 5, Routledge, 2001, pp 3-4 and available online at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; According to Borden's account, he used the term, 'marketing mix' consistently from the late 1940s. For instance, he is on record as having used the term, 'marketing mix,' in his presidential address given to the [[American Marketing Association]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Dominici, G., [http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1361725683.7557marketing%20mix54.PDF "From Marketing Mix to E-Marketing Mix: A Literature Review,"] ''International Journal of Business and Management'', vol. 9, no. 4. 2009, pp 17-24&lt;/ref&gt; Borden's continued and consistent use of the phrase, "marketing mix," contributed to the process of popularising the concept. The "marketing mix" concept gained widespread acceptance with the publication, in 1960, of [[E. Jerome McCarthy]]'s text, ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach'' which outlined the ingredients in the mix as the memorable 4 Ps, namely product, price, place and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinides, ., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing Management'', vol. 22, 2006 pp 407-438 Online: http://intranet.fucape.br/uploads/MATERIAIS_AULAS/25112-8.pdf; Dominici, G., [http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1361725683.7557marketing%20mix54.PDF "From Marketing Mix to E-Marketing Mix: A Literature Review,"] ''International Journal of Business and Management'', vol. 9, no. 4. 2009, pp 17-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paseo de la Reforma''' is a wide avenue that runs diagonally across the heart of [[Mexico City]]. It was designed by [[Ferdinand von Rosenzweig]] in the 1860s and modeled after the great [[boulevard]]s of [[Europe]],&lt;ref name=Exc&gt;{{cite web|title=Excélsior en la Historia: La metamorfosis de Paseo de la Reforma|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2013/07/31/911511|publisher=[[Excélsior]]|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Ringstraße]] in [[Vienna]] and the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]]. After the [[French intervention in Mexico]] overthrew the constitutional President [[Benito Juárez]], the newly crowned Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] made his mark on the conquered city.  He commissioned a grand avenue linking the city center with his imperial residence, [[Chapultepec Castle]], which was then on the southwestern edge of town.  The project was originally named Paseo de la Emperatriz ("Promenade of the Empress") in honor of Maximilian's consort and second cousin [[Empress Carlota]].  After her return to Europe and Maximilian's subsequent execution, the restored Juárez government renamed the Paseo in honor of the [[Reform War]].

It is now home to many of Mexico's tallest buildings such as the [[Torre Mayor]] and others in the [[Zona Rosa (Mexico)|Zona Rosa]].  More modern extensions continue the avenue at an angle to the old Paseo.  To the northeast it continues toward [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]], where it changes its name near the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]].  There it divides into Calzada de Guadalupe and Calzada de los Misterios that continue toward [[Basilica of Guadalupe|La Villa]]. Its western portion going west from [[Chapultepec|Chapultepec Park]] passes south of [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]] on its way through the affluent neighborhood of [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] and then into [[Cuajimalpa]] and [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]] on the outskirts of the city, although when it reaches this point it is more a highway than a promenade.

[[Image:BicycleSundayPaseoReformaDF.JPG|thumb|right|Bicycles traveling on Paseo de la Reforma. On Sundays this broad avenue is closed to vehicular traffic. The Statue of [[Cuauhtémoc]] is in the background]]

Today, the Reforma is filled with tourist attractions, luxurious restaurants and hotels, office buildings, public art exhibitions, and new construction.

Reforma has become a traditional place for the Mexicans to celebrate or protest. Most protest rallies commonly go along Reforma from the [[Angel of Independence]] to the [[Zócalo]], or from the Zócalo to [[Los Pinos]]. Many parades also make their way through Reforma. The Angel of Independence roundabout is a traditional place for the celebration of the victories of the [[Mexico national football team|national football team]], mostly during [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].

==History==
===19th century===
[[File:Nivel Cero de la Ciudad de México.JPG|thumb|right|''Nivel cero de la Ciudad de México'', topographic monument 1875, to mark the path of the Paseo.]]

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico]], in 1864 the republican government was on the run in northern Mexico and in Mexico City the government under [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was entrenched in power. It proclaimed, and in some cases instituted a series of reforms to modernize the country. These included the building of infrastructure to improve domestic communications, including roads and railroads. One such project type was the creation of a series of boulevards, imitating European ones such as the [[Ringstraße]] in Vienna, or the ones under construction at that time in Paris under [[Napoleon III]], lined with grand monuments.&lt;ref name="Christlieb"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fernández Christlieb|first=Federico |title=Europa y el urbanismo neoclásico en la ciudad de México: antecendente y esplendores |year=2000 |publisher=Plaza y Valdés |isbn=968856799X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two such projects were begun, one on Avenida Chapultepec, which was never completed, and the other to connect the city of Mexico with [[Chapultepec Castle]] (where emperor Maximilian resided). The latter was named Paseo de la Emperatriz, in honor of the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]]. Austrian mining engineer Alois Bolland was put in charge of the project and designed what was finally implemented.

The route and the construction of six boulevards radiating outward from the [[Zócalo]], Mexico City's main square, was assigned to a committee of prominent architects (Carl Gangolf and Ramón Rodríguez Arangoiti) and artists (Felipe Sojo, Miguel Noreña, Santiago Rebull). The committee's original proposal planned . However, this would have required the demolition of large portion of the buildings in the city, as happened in Paris. The committee decided instead to begin the boulevard at what was then the edge of the city, 1.5&amp;nbsp;km west of the Zócalo, where [[Avenida Bucareli]] meets [[Avenida Juárez]] and where the [[Equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain]] stood. From that location, the Paseo's route led to the bottom of the royal residential area at [[Chapultepec Castle]], where it connected to the road circling up to the castle at the top of the hill.&lt;ref name = NRC &gt;* {{Cite book |author= Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Manuel Menchaca Mier. |title= Nuevo Rostro De La Ciudad, Paseo De La Reforma - Centro Histórico |year= 2005 |publisher= México: Gobierno del Distrito Federal |id= 968-5740-05-4 |pages= 50–79
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=setravi&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140110112135/http://www.setravi.df.gob.mx/wb/stv/paseo_de_la_reforma/_rid/77?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian engineers Bolland and Ferdinand van Rosenzweig were assigned to construct the boulevard. Originally it included two vehicle paths, 9 meters wide each, a central island 1.5 meters wide, and two pedestrian side paths, each 9 meters wide, resplendent with ornamental plants and trees. The city government and the owners of the agricultural land along the route opposed the plan. Reasons included the fragility of the land, which was reclaimed lake bed of [[Lake Texcoco]], and that the saltiness of the soil would supposedly not support the lush vegetation required.

Despite opposition, the project continued. After a competition, it was assigned to the brothers Juan and Ramón Agea under the supervision of the Ministry of Development, Colonization, Industry and Commerce, headed by Luis Robles Pezuela. Of the original 3.15&amp;nbsp;km-long project, only one part was completed between 1864 and 1865, a road 20 meters wide, which was enormous for those days, without a central median, only a few areas on the side reserved for horses to rest. There were practically no buildings along the boulevard and sidewalks were not considered necessary.&lt;ref name = NRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=setravi/&gt;

The Paseo didn't include bridges or similar constructions to cross the canals and rivers which then flowed near what is now [[Colonia Tabacalera]] (then Hacienda de la Teja). The Paseo was at this time for the exclusive use of the imperial court, a policy enforced by a dedicated police force. At the time, people with horses or horses and carriages, promenaded along the Paseo de Bucareli (today [[Avenida Bucareli]] between Avenidas Juárez and Chapultepec.&lt;ref name = NRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=setravi/&gt;

After the downfall of the [[Second Mexican Empire]] and the restoration of the republic in 1867, the Paseo de la Emperatriz was forgotten. The Paseo was renamed Paseo Juárez and then again renamed Paseo de Degollado in honor of General [[Santos Degollado]].&lt;ref name = NRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=setravi/&gt;

On February 17, 1867 the Paseo officially opened to the public while work continued on it. By 1870 it had tree-lined pedestrian medians between "el Caballito" and the Palm Tree Roundabout, carried out by the Ministry of Development under Francisco P. Herrera. Between 1872 and 1876 an eight meter bridge was built at Hacienda de laTeja and the pedestrian medians were completed all the way to Chapultepec. Eucalyptus and ash trees and willows were planted and four monumental roundabouts were built between the Palm Tree Roundabout and Avenida Juárez. In 1872 the boulevard was renamed Paseo de la Reforma. On its flanks, upscale subdivisions were built, Colonia Americana – today [[Colonia Juárez, Mexico City|Colonia Juárez]], and [[Colonia Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Colonia Cuauhtémoc]]. The French style of the area was epitomized at the time by frequent comparisons of Paseo de la Reforma to the Champs Elysées in Paris.&lt;ref name = NRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=setravi/&gt;

==Renovation==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2018}}
Since 2003, Mexico City's government started a renewal program for Paseo de la Reforma. It included the maintenance of the existent gardens and the creation of new ones, the intensive cleaning and sweeping of streets and sidewalks, the construction of new pink quarry sidewalks and benches, the creation of access bays in the Zoo, lake and Modern Art Museum for touristic and school buses, the installation of new lighting, the moving of the monument to Cuauhtémoc to the crossing of [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Insurgentes Avenue]] and Paseo de la Reforma, the construction of prism shaped concrete structures in the median which also have plants and flowers, the promotion of Reforma as a cultural walk organizing different expositions along the avenue sidewalks, and the maintenance of the monuments, sculptures and fountains. Also, a touristic route that goes from Chapultepec Park to the Historic Center along Reforma was established by a double deck bus called ''Turibus''.

With the renewal project, new life has come to the avenue. It has become a main attraction of the city and the most expensive one to build on. However, after many of Mexico City's banks and business left Paseo de la Reforma for the [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]] business district in the last decade, the boulevard has been the center of a real estate renaissance. Remarkable buildings built in recent years are [[Torre Mayor]], [[Torre HSBC]] in the Ángel roundabout, [[Torre Libertad]] with [[Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide|St. Regis Hotel]] in the Diana fountain roundabout, and [[Reforma 222]] designed by famous Mexican architect [[National Auditorium|Teodoro González de León]] at Reforma and Havre St. Recently opened mix-used developments include a Ritz-Carlton Hotel &amp; Residences and a Park Hyatt Hotel &amp; Residences.

==Streetscape==
===Architecture===
{{unsourced section|date=November 2018}}
During [[Porfirio Díaz|President Díaz]]'s regime, Paseo de la Reforma became very popular among elite families as a residential area.  Few of these original houses built in different European architectural styles remain and office blocks have been built on their place over the years.  Although there is no single block that has kept its former architecture, a couple of scattered buildings show the opulence enjoyed by the elites during Porfirio Díaz' regime.

Although most of the modern buildings are unremarkable, the [[Art Deco]] [[Loteria Nacional]] building and the [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]] building are an exception. Today Paseo de la Reforma houses offices ranging from the Mexican Federal Government to Banks and brokerage houses. The newer buildings show a mix of contemporary styles and the commonly used style for office buildings.

[[List of tallest buildings in Mexico City#Buildings under construction|Five skyscrapers]] were recently along the boulevard between the entrance to [[Chapultepec Park]] and the [[Diana the Huntress fountain]]: [[Torre Reforma]] (244m), [[Punto Chapultepec]] (238m), [[Torre BBVA Bancomer]] (235m), and [[Torre Diana]] (158m).

===Monuments===
Many monuments to people and events in [[History of Mexico|Mexico's history]] and the history of the [[Americas]] are situated on and along Reforma. Honored people include the ''[[Niños Héroes]]'' &amp;ndash; the Heroic Cadets of the [[Battle of Chapultepec]]  &amp;ndash; with a particularly grand monument in the entrance of Chapultepec Park, a [[Monument to Cuauhtémoc]], [[Simón Bolívar]], [[José de San Martín]] and [[Christopher Columbus]]. There is also a fountain with sculptures that commemorate the nationalization of Mexico's [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves and industry in 1938, and the [[Diana the Huntress Fountain]] that includes a statue featuring the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] originally named ''The Arrow Thrower of the North Star''.

One of the most famous monuments of the Paseo is the [[Angel of Independence]] &amp;ndash; a tall column with a gilded statue of a [[Nike (mythology)|Winged Victory]] (that bears resemblance with an angel, therefore its common name) on its top and many marble statues on its base depicting the heroes of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], built to commemorate the centennial of Mexico's independence in 1910. The base contains the tombs of several key figures in Mexico's [[Mexican War of Independence|war of independence]].

Near the central section of Reforma, across from the Alameda, is the [[Monumento a la Revolución]] ("Monument to the Revolution"). This is an enormous dome supported by four arches. It was originally planned, by [[Porfirio Díaz]], to be a part of a new parliament building, but it never was completed because of the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. 
After Díaz's overthrow it became a monument to the revolution that deposed him. The remains of [[Francisco I. Madero]] and several other heroes of the [[Mexican Revolution]] are buried here.

The '''Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce''' ({{zh|c=檳州中华总商会}}), established in June 1903, was the first Chinese [[Chamber of Commerce]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pccc.org.my/ Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malayan Chinese and China conversion in identity consciousness, 1945-1957 I.D.E. Occasional papers series: Conversion in Identity Consciousness, 1945-1957 By Fujio Hara Published by Institute of Developing Economies, 1997; p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established in 1903, the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce (PCCC) was one of the pioneer trade organizations founded at the turn of the twentieth century in this region.&lt;br /&gt;

A 1908 article gives an idea of the early history of the Chamber:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Among prominent mercantile houses of Pinang there are many conducted by Chinese who follow closely and successfully the methods of Western competitors. As might be expected, the proprietors of these establishments have been quick to recognise the value and importance of an organisation for the protection of their common interests. In June, 1903, they founded the Pinang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture. This institution has a membership representing about a hundred firms, and is open to Chinese merchants, traders, agents and others interested in the commerce and agriculture of the settlement. The object of its promoters is not only the protection of common trade interests , but also the collection and classification of mercantile information and the establishment of a court of arbitration to adjust commercial differences. The offices of the Chamber are in the Tin Exchange Rooms. The office-holders are Mr. Lim Kek Chuan (林克全), president; Mr. Leong Lok Hing (梁樂卿), vice-president; Mr. Yeow Paik Tat, treasurer; and Mr. Kaw Cheng Sian (辜禎善), secretary. The committee is composed of Messrs Quah Beng Kee (柯孟淇), Goh Boon Keng (吳文景), Goh Say Eng (吳世榮), Oon Boon Tan (溫文旦), Lim Seng Hooi (林成輝), Ong Hun Chong (王漢宗), Khaw Joo Tok (許如琢), Lo Poey Chee (羅培芝), Ng See Sin (吳時信), [[Chung Thye Phin]] (鄭大平), Oh Ah Min, Yeap Yin Khye.
''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources by Wright Arnold, Publication date: 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Re-examination of the “Chinese nationalism” and Categorization of the Chinese in Malaya: The Case of the Chinese in Penang, 1890s-1910s by SHINOZAKI Kaori, Ph.D. student, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences University of Tokyo; Email: kaoris@pd.jaring.my presented at The Penang Story – International Conference 2002, 18–21 April 2002, The City Bayview Hotel, Penang, Malaysia organised by The Penang Heritage Trust &amp; STAR Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1946 the British Military Administration decided to end Penang's duty-free status. That together with the plan to break up the Straits Settlements and impose the [[Malayan Union]] prompted the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce to lead a protest of Penang's chambers of commerce including the Penang Indian Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Muslim Chamber of Commerce. The protests aimed at the Colonial Office proved successful and Penang's [[free port]] status was restored in June 1946.&lt;ref&gt;A Modern History of Southeast Asia: Decolonization, Nationalism and Separatism By Clive J. Christie Published by I.B.Tauris, 1996; p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1948 The Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce donated 7,770 Straits dollars for the establishment of a Chinese [[consulate]] which was eventually closed in January 1950;&lt;ref&gt;Xian Dai Ri Bao, January 24, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malayan Chinese and China conversion in identity consciousness, 1945-1957 I.D.E. Occasional papers series: Conversion in Identity Consciousness, 1945-1957 By Fujio Hara Published by Institute of Developing Economies, 1997; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber is now one of the strongest commercial institutions in Malaysia in terms of membership and organizational and functional characteristic that is well recognized by both the public and private sectors. In 2003, the Registrar of Society of Malaysia (ROS) presented the Award Certificate of Excellent Society to the Chamber. It has also been awarded the ISO 9001:2000 Quality Management System (QMS) Certificate in March 2006.

==Objectives==

(a)    to improve and develop trade and industry.
(b)    to collect, collate and disseminate commercial information and to issue certificates of authentication.
(c)    to arbitrate and settle trade and industrial disputes.
(d)    to collect and compile trade statistics.
(e)    to organize trade exhibitions, seminars and human resource development programmes either on its own or in collaboration with other institution(s).
(f)    to support charitable, cultural and educational institutions.

== Membership ==

The Chamber now has more than a thousand members composed of individuals, corporations as well as commercial associations and trade guilds. The members of PCCC are from various business sectors, including enterprises, financial institutions, listed companies, housing &amp; construction, garment &amp; textiles, sole-agents &amp; retailers.

==Organization==

Policy formulation and decision making at the highest level of PCCC are vested in a 51-member General Committee headed by a President; assisted by a Deputy President and 3 Vice-Presidents. A 14-member Executive Committee elected from the ranks of the General Committee meet regularly to supervise the implementation of the policies and strategies formulated and planned by the latter while a permanent Secretariat takes charge of the day-to-day running of the Chamber's affairs.
 
There are 9 Working Committees and 3 ''Ad Hoc'' Committees charged with various specific functional topics such as small and medium enterprises &amp; human resources development, economics, finance &amp; taxation, housing &amp; construction, infrastructure &amp; public facilities, information technology, transport, logistics &amp; customs, Malaysia-China business development, tourism etc. all geared towards complementing the Chamber's important role as a conduit for the exchange of views and information between the Authorities and business community and in promoting the interest of its members in particular and the economic well-being of the country in general.

==Links==

The Chamber has great rapport with the Government at regional as well as national level through its direct affiliation to the Associated Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia and indirect connection with the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia. PCCC is officially represented at the following public bodies:
 
* Penang Joint Chambers of Commerce

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13630">'''Preferred metric sizes''' are a set of [[international standard]]s and [[de facto standard]]s that are designed to make using the metric system easier and simpler, especially in engineering and construction practices. One of the methods used to arrive at these preferred sizes is the use of [[Preferred number|preferred numbers]] and [[Convenient number|convenient numbers]] such as the [[Renard series]], the [[1-2-5 series]] to limit the number of different sizes of components needed.

One of the largest benefits of such limits is an ensuing multiplicative or exponential reduction in the number of parts, tools and other items needed to support the installation and maintenance of the items built using these techniques. This occurs because eliminating one diameter fastener will typically allow the elimination of a large number of variations on that diameter (multiple thread pitches, multiple lengths, multiple tip types, multiple head types, multiple drive types, and the tools needed for installing each, including multiple drill bits (one for each different thread pitch, material, and fit combination).

=== Liquor Bottle Sizes ===
International agreements, including 75/106/EEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.welmec.org/fileadmin/user_files/publications/6-1.pdf|title=Application of Directives 75/106/EEC and 76/211/EEC concerning the marking and quantity control of e-marked prepackages|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specify 0.1, 0.25 ({{frac|1|4}}), 0.375 ({{frac|3|8}}), 0.5 ({{frac|1|2}}), 0.75 ({{frac|3|4}}), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres as the capacities of liquor bottles allowed in international commerce.

In the United States, the alcohol industry switched to metric bottle sizes on October 1, 1976, abandoning the existing 38 sizes of bottles and instead adopting the following sizes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/11/archives/liquor-industry-converts-to-metric-system-liquor-industry-is.html|title=Liquor Industry Converts to Metric System|last=Cherry|first=Rona|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 200 ml (replaced the half-pint)
* 500 ml (replaced the pint)
* 750 ml (replaced the fifth)
* 1000 ml (replaced the quart)
* 1750 ml (replaced the half-gallon)

=== System 32 Furniture ===
[[System 32 (furniture)|System 32]] is a standard for the design and manufacture of furniture, most commonly used in the design of cabinets, wherein the major parts (sides, doors, etc.) are available in increments of 32&amp;nbsp;mm, and shelf supports consist of columns of 5&amp;nbsp;mm holes on 32&amp;nbsp;mm centers.

=== ISO 2848 Basic Module ===
The [[ISO 2848]] basic module is a unit of 100&amp;nbsp;mm, often represented by a single capital "M", along with 300&amp;nbsp;mm and 600&amp;nbsp;mm groupings, that is widely used for the widths of furniture in Europe.
* A standard metric (concrete) block is 190 mm wide, 390 mm long, and 190 mm high, which allows for 10 mm mortar joints in between bricks, giving a standard unit size of 200 mm square by 400 mm long.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themetricmaven.com/?p=8268|title=Another Brick in the Wall|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A standard metric brick is 90 by 57 by 190 mm; with 10 mm of mortar, that produces a standard unit of 100 mm x 200 mm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Office Equipment &amp; Supplies ==
=== ISO 216 Paper Sizes ===
[[ISO 216]] standard specifies the A sizes of paper, including the very common A4, wherein the base size of A0 is one square meter, and the ratio between the height and width is {{radic|2}}, which results in all sizes of paper having the same aspect ratio.

Also related is the set of pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00&amp;nbsp;mm).

== Manufacturing ==
=== ISO 261 and 262 Fastener Diameters ===
ISO 261 defines a set of preferred metric machine screw/bolt sizes, and [[ISO 262]] defines a subset of those; both are based roughly on [[Renard series]] as defined in [[ISO 3]], [[ISO 17]], and [[ISO 497]]. Given that even ISO 262 specifies a fairly large set of diameters, a much simplified set of preferred diameters was developed by one of the lead designers of [[ASME Z17.1]] and ANSI B4.2, Knut O. Kverneland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metric Standards for Worldwide Manufacturing|last=Kverneland|first=Knut O.|publisher=Amer Society of Mechanical Engineers|year=1996|isbn=978-0791800416|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the list to 6 preferred sizes, and another 6 intermediate supplementary sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gometricusa.org/table2.html|title=TABLE 2 - FASTENER SIZES|last=Kverneland|first=Kurt|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each size bolt or screw and type of head, there is a corresponding size driver prescribed by various ISO standards, including:
* Internal hex drive: ISO 2936:2001 "Assembly tools for screws and nuts—Hexagon socket screw keys"
* External hex drive: ISO  4014, 4015, 4015, 4017, and 4018.

=== ISO 1307 Plastic Hose Sizes ===
ISO 1307:2006, Rubber and plastics hoses—Hose sizes, minimum and maximum inside diameters, and tolerances on cut-to-length hoses specifies nominal diameters for four different types of plastic hoses, including "Type C", which includes the typical [[garden hose]]. Each nominal diameter specifies different ID minimum and maximum values. Notice that the nominal size is a Renard Series.

=== ISO 6708 Nominal Diameter ===
{{Anchor|ISO 6708}}
Nominal diameter, abbreviated DN, is the designation system specified by ISO 6708 for specifying the diameter of trade sizes of metric pipework components, and is the metric equivalent to [[Nominal Pipe Size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/21274.html|title=ISO 6708:1995: Pipework components -- Definition and selection of DN (nominal size)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is among several ISO specifications that formalize [[preferred number]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and is referred to by numerous other international standards, including ISO 7598 and EN 10255. The complete set of DN values allowed by the standard are:

The number following the DN is a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal value]] that is roughly the number of millimeters of a circular feature on the connection point of the pipe, fitting, coupling, etc., but often differing by a noticeable amount. If the DN value is related to the internal bore diameter of the feature, the size should be represented by DN/ID (for Inside Diameter), and if the DN value is related to the outside diameter, the size should be represented by DN/OD (for Outside Diameter).

The relationship between DN and [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] pipe sizes are as follows. Note that the actual internal diameter varies depending on the pipe wall thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wes.ir/files/797832605piptub.pdf|title=Tube Sizes - ISO|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">'''Raja Mudaliar''' or sometimes spelt '''Raja Mendeliar''' was the richest trader in [[Malacca]] during the early 16th century [[Common Era|CE]]. He belonged to the [[Chitty]] community.

According to [[Sejarah Melayu]], Raja Mudaliar was the Syahbandar (Chief of Port) of Malacca. He was portrayed as a treacherous person who was responsible for concocting false accusation to sow distrust between [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]] and his [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Mutahir of Malacca|Tun Mutahir]], resulting in the execution of Tun Mutahir and his whole family. As a result, the Sultan was antagonized and the palace split into factions, this disunity made Malacca vulnerable to the invading Portuguese.

==Career==
Ramón Tamayo worked as a producer for nearly three decades in the Lope de Vega company, founded by his brother Joseph Tamayo in 1946,&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Rosana|title=Ramón Tamayo, productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Necrologicas/Ramon/Tamayo/productor/teatral/elpepinec/20080624elpepinec_4/Tes|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El País|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with which he toured the Spanish territory making known the new generation of foreign authors during the Franco regime.

He directed the National Drama Centre between 1979 and 1981 along with actors [[Nuria Espert]] and [[José Luis Gómez (actor)|José Luis Gómez]]. While the latter two were responsible for art direction, Tamayo took care of the inner workings, management and production.&lt;ref name=Esteban&gt;{{cite news|last=Esteban|first=Rafael|title=Ramón Tamayo, empresario y productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Businessman and theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/06/24/obituarios/1214301147.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El Mundo|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure, the center hosted around twenty shows such as ''Los baños de Argel'' (The Algiers baths), directed by Francisco Nieva; ''La velada en Benicarl,'' (Vigil in Benicarl) directed by ( Manuel Azaña).

With other companies he produced ''Sueño de una noche de verano'' (Dream of a summer's night), from  Lindsay Kemp as well as debutting other plays in a national theater -  the Theatre Lliure and the Els Joglars.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Rosana|title=Ramón Tamayo, productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Necrologicas/Ramon/Tamayo/productor/teatral/elpepinec/20080624elpepinec_4/Tes|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El País|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a stint in the public theater, Tamayo returned to the private, back to the Lope de Vega company and the Fine Arts Theatre, where he directed with his brother until 2003, when his brother died. Ramón Tamayo died five years later in Madrid at the age of 87 years.&lt;ref name="Diario Ideal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Diario Ideal|title=Muere a los 87 años Ramón Tamayo, ex director del Centro Dramático Nacional (English: Ramón Tamayo, former director of the National Dramatic Center dies at 87 years of age) (in Spanish)|url= http://www.ideal.es/granada/20080624/cultura/muere-anos-ramon-tamayo-20080624.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=Agencias Diario Ideal|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Refining''' (also perhaps called by the mathematical term '''affining''') is the process of [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] of a (1) [[chemical compound|substance]] or a (2) [[Theory of Forms|form]]. The term is usually used of a [[natural resource]] that is almost in a usable form, but which is more useful in its pure form. For instance, most types of natural [[petroleum]] will burn straight from the ground, but it will burn poorly and quickly clog an engine with residues and by-products. The term is broad, and may include more drastic transformations, such as the reduction of [[ore]] to [[metal]] (for which see [[Refining (metallurgy)]]).

The refining of [[liquid]]s is often accomplished by [[distillation]] or [[fractional distillation|fractionation]]; this process is useful, for example, for isolating different fractions of [[petroleum]].  [[Gas]]es can be refined in this way as well, by being cooled and/or compressed until they liquefy. Gases and liquids can also be refined by [[solvent extraction|extraction]] with a selective [[solvent]] that dissolves away either the substance of interest, or the unwanted impurities.

Many [[solid]]s can be refined by growing [[crystal]]s in a [[solution]] of the impure material; the regular structure of the crystal tends to favor the desired material and exclude other kinds of particles.

[[Chemical reaction]]s are often used to remove impurities of particular types.

The use of [[silicon]] and other [[semiconductor]]s in [[electronics]] depends on precise control of impurities. The [[zone melting]] process developed by [[William Gardner Pfann]] was used to produce pure [[germanium]], and subsequently [[float-zone silicon]] became available when Henry Theuerer of [[Bell Labs]] adapted Pfann's method to silicon.

Types of materials that are usually refined:
* [[metal]]s - see [[Refining (metallurgy)]]
* [[petroleum]]
* [[silicon]]
* [[sugar]]
* [[table salt]]
* [[vegetable oil]]
* [[air]]
* [[refining (glass)|glass]]

==See also==
*[[Continuous distillation]]
*[[Natural gas processing]]
*[[Oil refinery]]
*Refinery
*[[Refining (metallurgy)]]
*[[Wafer (electronics)]]
*[[Air separation]]

'''Dr. Simon Gicharu''' is an educationalist and founder of [[Mount Kenya University]], which is East and Central Africa’s largest private university. He was born in 1964 in Gathiruini village, in [[Kiambu|Kiambu County]], Kenya. He is the first in a family of seven. Dr. Gicharu is also the Chairman of the Rural Electrification Authority and National Private Universities Owners Association of Kenya. He is the founder of Equip Africa Institute  and patron of the Graduate Enterprise Academy. He is also a board member at Thika Water and Sewerage Company, and the patron of Inter Universities Rover Moot under the [[The Kenya Scouts Association|Kenya Scouts Association]]. In 2015, Dr. Gicharu was named the Eastern African [[Ernst &amp; Young|Ernst and Young]] Entrepreneur of the Year. He is married with three children.

==Early life and education==
His early life experiences were the cauldron in which his successful characteristic traits were shaped. As a pupil at Kiawairia Primary School and later Gathiruini Secondary School, Gicharu had to walk many kilometres to and from school. His parents were peasant farmers and their small piece of land, which they tilled for subsistence, provided barely enough for their upkeep. To supplement the domestic income, Dr. Gicharu, alongside his siblings, picked coffee at large commercials farms where he was paid by the kilo.

At Murang’a High School where he undertook his O-Levels, he was the captain in his final year. While in school, he etched a reputation for entrepreneurial acumen, and for assisting fellow students in Mathematics, a subject he excelled in.

Mr Gicharu obtained a Bachelor of Education Science (Honours) degree from [[Kenyatta University]] in 1990. His majors were Mathematics and Chemistry. Soon after graduation, he continued to exercise his passion for education, teaching his favourite Maths subject at various secondary schools in Kenya, and later at the [[Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology]], and at the [http://wikimapia.org/9568852/Thika-Technical-Training-Institute Thika Technical Training Institute]. He would also author Kenya’s first post-secondary school book on Mathematics, Applied Mathematics for Craft Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maktaba.ku.ac.ke/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=99353 |title=Kenyatta University Library catalog › Details for: Applied mathematics for craft engineering |publisher=Maktaba.ku.ac.ke |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Dr. Gicharu has also previously worked as a lecturer at Thika Technical Training Institute. In 1995, he earned a British Council scholarship to study Managing Enterprise Development at Cranfield University, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. When he came back he established Kenya Entrepreneurship Promotion Programme (KEPP), which provided micro-loans and training to young [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]]. His seed capital was only Ksh20,000 (US$220). KEPP later started offering training in [[Computer|computers]] and changed its name to Thika School of Management Studies (TSMS), with introduction of [[Management]] courses. 
Gradually, TSMS increased its student enrolment and the number of courses. The type of courses it offered was determined by the [[job]] demands of the day and with the explosion in use of information science and [[technology]], TSMS changed its name to Thika Institute of Technology (TIT) in 2003.

That same year, Dr. Gicharu, resolved that Science training would be the backbone of TIT. He made a blind trip to [[India]], on scanty information that at the [[Punjab State]], they were assembling [[Science]] equipment in cottage industries that was relatively affordable. Dr. Gicharu immediately purchased the equipment.  TIT was the first private college in [[Kenya]] to be accredited to offer the Diploma programme in [[Pharmacy]].

In 2017, Gicharu was noted to have a keen interest in venturing into the media within Kenya, having already started a television and radio station in Rwanda.
Gicharu and Tom Mshindi (Editor in Chief of [[Nation Media Group]]) hold controlling shares in 360 media&lt;ref&gt;http://nairobilawmonthly.com/index.php/2018/06/05/media-like-false-preachers/&lt;/ref&gt; headed by former [[Nation Media Group]] reporter Samwel Born Maina. The firm was set up by Gicharu and team to “disrupt the media relations sector in Kenya, especially in an election year.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.360media.co.ke/?p=1640&lt;/ref&gt;
Gicharu’s 360 Media has become linked to the scandal involving [[Cambridge Analytica]] developing online campaigns in the 2017 Kenyan elections portraying “[[Raila Odinga]] as a blood-thirsty individual who is also sympathetic to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] and having no development agenda,” whilst portraying the incumbent President Kenyatta as “tough on terrorism, and being good for the economy.”&lt;ref&gt;http://nairobilawmonthly.com/index.php/2018/06/05/media-like-false-preachers/&lt;/ref&gt;
Gicharu has recently gone on to self-fund TV47 and Beats 47 in Kenya, new television and radio stations, via his company Cape Media, headed by his son Kevin Gicharu.&lt;ref&gt;https://businesstoday.co.ke/mku-founder-launches-tv-radio-station/&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==
In 2008, the Institute was awarded a Letter of Interim Authority by the Commission for University Education in Kenya, to operate as an independent university under the name Mount Kenya University. The university was granted a full Charter status in 2011. At the age of 46 years, Dr. Gicharu became the youngest Kenyan to have established a chartered university. The only other indigenous Chartered university was started by the former President H.E Daniel Arap Moi. Mount Kenya University, with 16 Campuses and Centres in Kenya, Rwanda, Somaliland, Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda employs over 3,000 people and has a student population of about 50,000. The University is a member of Inter-university Council of East Africa and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

'''Václav Laurin''' (16 October 1865, Kamení near [[Pěnčín (Liberec District)|Pěnčín]] – 13 August 1930, [[Mladá Boleslav]]) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[engineer]], [[industrialist]] and automotive pioneer who, along with [[Václav Klement]], founded automobile manufacturer [[Laurin &amp; Klement]] that later became today's [[Škoda Auto]].

==Career==
He apprenticed as a [[locksmith]] in Mladá Boleslav, where, in 1895, he and [[Václav Klement]] founded the company [[Laurin &amp; Klement]] (now [[Škoda Auto]]). At the beginning of December 1895, the mechanic Václav Laurin and the book-seller Václav Klement, both [[bicycle]] enthusiasts, started manufacturing bicycles of their own design, patriotically named Slavia in the [[nationalist]] atmosphere of the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skoda.co.uk/skoda-history|title=The history of ŠKODA|last=|first=|date=|website=ŠKODA UK|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Laurin manufactured their first [[automobile]]. Today, the company enjoys worldwide popularity under the brand Škoda Auto.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laurin was prominently engaged in the automobile company Laurin &amp; Klement, together with his collaborator Václav Klement, co-founder of the company. He participated in the construction of vehicles there. In his later years, he was the [[technical director]] of Škoda Auto.

==History==
Warwick's School of Industrial and Business Studies (SIBS) was founded in 1967, with Brian Houlden as Chair, a total of five academic staff and 24 students across three programmes (MSc Management &amp; Business Studies, MSc Management Science &amp; Operational Research, Doctoral programme). It quickly gained a reputation for excellent research, particularly in the field of [[industrial relations]]. The Industrial Relations Research Unit, founded by [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]] in 1970 focused on achieving a better understanding of workplace industrial relations in general and workplace trade unionism in particular, in a time when the UK was perceived to suffer greatly from industrial strife and poor economic performance.

In 1981, the MSc in Management was renamed the Warwick MBA. At its 20th anniversary in 1987, SIBS was renamed Warwick Business School. The department had grown to over 100 staff, 815 students and 11 programs. In 1997, following expansion of the distance learning MBA in particular, the staff tally was over 260, with 3,160 students across 17 programs.

In 2000, a new Executive MBA teaching centre was opened, the first of four phases of development of new premises for WBS. Further phases opened in 2001 and 2006, increasing the teaching capacity of WBS dramatically. This was followed by aggressive recruitment of academic faculty. In 2006, there were a total of 319 staff and 7,539 students across 25 degree programs, from over 100 countries worldwide.

In September 2014, WBS opened a second campus in [[The Shard]] Tower in [[London]] to teach its MSc Finance, MSc Human Resource Management and Employment Relations along with its Executive MBA courses.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

In August 2015, WBS opened Phase 3b of its Scarman Road building on The University of Warwick campus. The £30m extension &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbs.ac.uk/news/interior-of-30m-wbs-extension-revealed/.html Interior of £30m WBS extension revealed]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; houses a 292-seat lecture theatre with a removable stage, a 120-seat lecture theatre which contains swivel chairs to allow for group work, a Behavioural Science Laboratory, a 150-seater café, nine seminar rooms, undergraduate and post-graduate learning spaces and four open plan offices for management and support staff plus a new reception.

Each teaching subject group has a group convenor or head, and devolved group management. Each research centre has a director, and has similarly devolved management. Research centres may have a board with external representation to ensure practical relevance of research strategy.

'''Waste management''' (or '''waste disposal''') are the activities and actions required to manage [[waste]] from its inception to its final disposal.&lt;ref name="UN-1997"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl/|website=unstats.un.org|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.

Waste can be solid, liquid, or gaseous and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, and household. In some cases waste can pose a threat to human health.&lt;ref name=JWM&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2014 |title=Editorial Board/Aims &amp; Scope |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X14000269 | doi=10.1016/S0956-053X(14)00026-9 |journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=IFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is produced by human activity, for example the extraction and processing of raw materials.&lt;ref name="UN97"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics|url= https://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl/gesform.asp?getitem=1178|website=unstats.un.org|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human [[health]], the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] or [[aesthetics]].

Waste management practices are not uniform among countries ([[developed nation|developed]] and [[developing nation]]s); regions ([[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s), and [[residential area|residential]] and [[industry|industrial]] sectors can all take different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davidson |first=Gary |date=June 2011 |title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review |accessdate=3 March 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University - Office of Sustainability |url=https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of waste management practices deal with [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity.&lt;ref name=HMSW&gt;{{cite book|date=2003 |title=Handbook of Solid Waste Management and Waste Minimization Technologies |pages=337–465 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780750675079500103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of waste management==
[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the waste hierarchy]]

===Waste hierarchy===
The [[waste hierarchy]] refers to the "3 Rs" [[Reduce (waste)|reduce]], [[reuse]] and [[recycling|recycle]], which classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of [[waste minimisation]]. The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste; see: [[resource recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disposalmag.com/#The_Proper_Care_and_Use_of_a_Garbage_Disposal|title=The Proper Care and Use of a Garbage Disposal|last=Albert|first=Raleigh|date=4 August 2011|website=Disposal Mag|language=en-US|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material recovery and [[waste-to-energy]]. The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without [[energy recovery]]. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book |publisher=United Nations Environmental Programme |year=2013 |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

===Life-cycle of a product===
The life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.

===Resource efficiency===
[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal. This process of resource efficiency can address [[sustainability]].

===Polluter-pays principle===
The [[polluter-pays principle]] mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.

==History==
{{Main article|History of waste management}}
Throughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the exploitation of [[natural resources]]. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.

However, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]
Following the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Nightingale, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/nightingale-rural.asp Selected Writings of Florence Nightingale]'', ed. Lucy Ridgely Seymer (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1954), pp. 38287&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751, when [[Corbyn Morris]] in London proposed that "... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the [[Thames]] to proper distance in the country".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centenary History of Waste and Waste Managers in London and South East England|first=Lewis|last=Herbert|publisher=[[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]|year=2007|url=http://ciwm.activedition.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=1094&amp;sID=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating [[cholera]] outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain  |location=London |year=1842 |pages=369–372 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html |last=Chadwick |first=Edwin}} via {{cite web |author=Laura Del Col |publisher=The Victorian Web |title=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions |date=11 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[social reform]]er, [[Edwin Chadwick]], in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population.

In the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in "moveable receptacles: for disposal—the first concept for a dust-bin.&lt;ref name="NWRA"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Waste &amp; Recycling Association |url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php |title=History of Solid Waste Management |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] 1894 destructor furnace. The use of [[incinerator]]s for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century.]]
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first [[incineration]] plants, or, as they were then called, "destructors". In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] to the design of Alfred Fryer.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recycling and the Politics of Urban Waste |author=Gandy, Matthew |year=1994 |publisher=Earthscan |isbn=9781853831683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.&lt;ref name="NWRA"/&gt;

Early [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150106135610/http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-06|title=Covered Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.

==Waste handling and transport==
{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Dustbin|Waste sorting}}
[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|Molded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]

Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.

===Waste handling practices===
[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.
In some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.
{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}
In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.
In [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of "Zero waste by 2020", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside "Fantastic 3" bin system – blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials – provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's "Pay-As-You-Throw" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.

==Financial models==
In most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.

In some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal methods==

===Landfill===
{{main article|Landfill}}
[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]
[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]

===Incineration===
{{main article|Incineration}}
Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as "[[thermal treatment]]". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].

Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].

Incineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.

==Recycling==
{{main article|Recycling}}
[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|300px|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]
[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as "[[single-stream recycling]]."&lt;ref&gt;City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation. [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/recycling1/what_is_single_streamrecycling.html "What is Single Stream Recycling."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland. Division of Solid Waste Services. [http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/apps/dep/solidwaste/collectionservices/curbside.asp "Curbside Collection."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber [[tire|tyres]], [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[carton]]s, [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-use==

===Biological reprocessing===
{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Recoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).

===Energy recovery===
{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}
Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt; Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].
An alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).

===Pyrolysis===
{{main article|Pyrolysis}}
Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=TSEP&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2017 |title= Potential of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451904917300690| journal=Thermal Science and Engineering Progress |volume=3 | pages=171–197 |doi=10.1016/j.tsep.2017.06.003 | last1 = Czajczyńska | first1 = D. | last2 = Anguilano | first2 = L. | last3 = Ghazal | first3 = H. | last4 = Krzyżyńska | first4 = R. | last5 = Reynolds | first5 = A.J. | last6 = Spencer | first6 = N. | last7 = Jouhara | first7 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of [[oxygen]]; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference – Pyrolysis&lt;/ref&gt; During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with [[temperature]]. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430&amp;nbsp;°C (800&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;By Prabir Basu: ''Biomass Gasification, Pyrolysis and Torrefaction: Practical Design and Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of [[waste biomass]] into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=WMJ&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X14003596| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466–2486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource recovery===
{{main article|Resource recovery}}
Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.&lt;ref name=Montana&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.&lt;ref name=Montana/&gt; Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.&lt;ref name=traverse&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.&lt;ref name=traverse/&gt;

Resource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.

As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals which can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticultural. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.

===Sustainability===
The management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain [[ISO14001]] accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the construction industry. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.  This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in Spain in June 2015 and on the international Conference on Green Urbanism, held in Italy 12–14 October 2016.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Liquid waste-management==

===Sewage sludge===
{{main article|Sewage sludge treatment}}
Sewage sludge is produced by waste water treatment processes. Due to rapid urbanization, there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results 0.1–30.8&amp;nbsp;kg of sewage per population equivalent per year (kg/p.e/year).&lt;ref name=RSER&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2017 |title= Thermochemical processing of sewage sludge to energy and fuel: Fundamentals, challenges and considerations|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117309036| journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=80| pages=888–913 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.262 | last1 = Syed Shatir | first1 = A. Syed-Hassan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Yi | last3 = Hu | first3 = Song | last4 = Su | first4 = Sheng | last5 = Xiang | first5 = Jun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration, composting, and landfill.

==Avoidance and reduction methods==
{{main article|Waste minimization}}
An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as [[waste reduction]]. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using [[disposable products]] (such as disposable [[cutlery]]), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html |title=Removing food remains to reduce waste |publisher=Recycling Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.edu/science/ALCOA/ALCOA-light.html |title=Lightweighting |series=Projects in Scientific Computing |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |last2=Johnson |first2=Liz |publisher=Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International waste movement==
While waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations, [[waste trade|trans-boundary movement of waste]] is often subject to international treaties. A major concern to many countries in the world has been [[hazardous waste]]. The [[Basel Convention]], ratified by 172 countries, deprecates movement of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. The provisions of the Basel convention have been integrated into the EU waste shipment regulation.
[[Radioactive waste]], although considered hazardous, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Basel Convention.

==Benefits==
Waste is not something that should be discarded or disposed of with no regard for future use.  It can be a valuable resource if addressed correctly, through policy and practise. With rational and consistent waste management practises there is an opportunity to reap a range of benefits. Those benefits include:
# Economic – Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.
# Social – By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.  Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.
# Environmental – Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.
# Inter-generational Equity – Following effective waste management practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more [[social inclusion|inclusive society]] and a cleaner environment.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

==Challenges in developing countries==
Areas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}  Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} All of these challenges, along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect the treatment of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Science Direct |year=2013 |journal=Waste Management|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=220–232 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.008 |title=Solid waste management challenges for cities in developing countries | last1 = Abarca Guerrero | first1 = Lilliana | last2 = Maas | first2 = Ger | last3 = Hogland | first3 = William}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Author? Title?}}

==Technologies==
Traditionally, the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Air-Trak Brings Visibility to Waste Management |date=4 February 2014 |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?11406 |publisher=RFID Journal |author=Claire Swedberg |access-date = 1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William B. Gartner''' (born 1953 in Richland (WA)) is an [[Americans|American]] Professor of entrepreneurship. He is known for his research on new venture creation and entrepreneurial behavior, for which he has received several awards, including the Heizer Doctoral Dissertation Award and the FSFNUTEK International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research (today known as the Global award for Entrepreneurship Research).&lt;ref&gt;Hjorth, Daniel &amp; Johannisson, Bengt (2005) William B. Gartner’s Contribution to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research. [Online] Available from: http://www.e-award.org/web/2005_William_B_Gartner.aspx [Accessed: July 14, 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner was one of the pioneering entrepreneurship research scholars in the 1980s, when there was a shift of focus in the field from studying the individual traits of the entrepreneur to regarding entrepreneurship as a behavioral process.&lt;ref&gt;Landström, Hans (2009) Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research. New York: Springer-Verlag New York Inc. {{ISBN|9781441916785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
William Gartner studied Business Administration at the [[University of Washington]] and obtained his master's degree, with a major in Business Policy, in 1977. He then worked in the engineering corps of the [[US army]] and at [[The Hertz Corporation]], before returning to Washington University to pursue an academic career. Gartner finished his doctoral studies in 1982, and received a Ph.D. in Business Administration.&lt;ref&gt;AoM Entrepreneurship Division Website (2015) Pioneer profiles [online] Available from: http://division.aomonline.org/ent/index.php/history-of-entrepreneurship-research/pioneers-within-the-field/pioneer-profiles/467-william-b-gartner [Accessed: July 14, 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1980s, William Gartner has worked at a number of Universities in the US and a few in Europe. In the period 1985-1986, he was chair of the [[Academy of Management]] Entrepreneurship interest group, which later became the Entrepreneurship Division. Today William Gartner holds a joint professorship at both the [[California Lutheran University]] and the [[Copenhagen Business School]] in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;California Lutheran University (2015) Faculty profile [online] Available from: http://www.callutheran.edu/faculty/profile.php?id=wgartner [Accessed: July 14, 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, [[Babson College]] has announced the appointment of Gartner as Bertarelli Foundation Distinguished Professor of Family Entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.babson.edu/news-events/babson-news/Pages/2017-william-gartner-named-bertarelli-foundation-distinguished-professor-family-entrepreneurship.aspx|title=Distinguished Professor of Family Entrepreneurship|last=College|first=Babson|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In the late 1980s William B. Gartner was one of the first researchers who argued for a different approach to entrepreneurship research. At that time, many scholars focused on the personality of the entrepreneur, trying to find personal attributes or skills common to all entrepreneurs. In his 1988 article, Who is the entrepreneur? Is the wrong question, Gartner argues against the above-mentioned approach, which he calls the “trait approach”. Instead he suggests that researchers should use a “behavioral approach”, focusing on the creation of new organizations and what the entrepreneur does, not who he or she is.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner, William B. (1988) Who is an entrepreneur? Is the wrong question.  American Journal of Small Business. 12 (4). P.11-32.&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the 1990s Gartner collaborated with several fellow researchers on different projects. His main focus was now more practically oriented than before, generating evidence and insights into the process of how entrepreneurs create organizations.  Among other things, he studied the behavior of entrepreneurs and the effect it had on the success of their new business ventures. Since the turn of the new millennium, Gartner has explored how entrepreneurship researchers’ theories, and the language they use, fit the way actual entrepreneurs think and talk. He has also examined new ways of understanding entrepreneurship, advocating the value of narrative methods.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner, William B. (2014) Entrepreneurship as Organizing. Edward Elgar Pub. {{ISBN|9781783471140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gartner received the Academy of Management’s Entrepreneurship Division Foundational Paper Award for the 1988 paper “Properties of Emerging Organizations.”, which he co-authored with fellow entrepreneurship professor [[Jerome Katz]].&lt;ref&gt;AoM Entrepreneurship Division Website (2015) Recent Award Winners [online] Available from: http://division.aomonline.org/ent/index.php/awards/recent-award-winners [Accessed: July 30, 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
