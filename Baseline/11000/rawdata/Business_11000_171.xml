An '''asset''' in [[economic theory]] is a [[durable good]] which can only be partially consumed (like a [[portable music player]]) or input as a [[factor of production]] (like a [[concrete mixer|cement mixer]]) which can only be partially used up in production.  The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis so it can be used as a [[store of value]].  As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period.  If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.

&lt;!-- attempt to guess at meaning of incomprehensible original--&gt;As a result of this definition, assets only have positive [[futures market|futures]] prices.  This is analogous to the distinction between consumer durables and non-durables.  Durables last more than one year.  A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon.  In a simple [[Walras]]ian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices.  In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period.  Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow.  Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.

The subfield of [[asset pricing]] (or valuation) is the financial evaluation of the value of such assets; the primary method used by today's [[financial analyst]]s is the [[discounted cash flow]] method.  With this method, an asset's future [[cash flow]]s are either assumed to be known with certainty (as in a [[treasury bond]] which is risk free) or estimated.  These future cash flows are discounting used [[present value]]s.

The [[Flow of Funds]] tables from the [[Federal Reserve System]] provide data about assets, which are tangible assets and financial assets, and liabilities. The difference, assets minus liabilities, is net worth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10339">The '''business judgment rule''' is a [[case law]]-derived doctrine in [[corporations law]] that courts defer to the business judgment of corporate executives. It is rooted in the principle that the "directors of a corporation... are clothed with [the] presumption, which the law accords to them, of being [motivated] in their conduct by a [[bona fide]] regard for the interests of the corporation whose affairs the stockholders have committed to their charge".&lt;ref name=Gimbel&gt;''Gimbel v. Signal Cos.'', 316 A.2d 599, 608 (Del. Ch. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule exists in some form in most [[common law]] countries, including the United States,&lt;ref name=Gimbel /&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;''[[BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders]]'', 2008 SCC 69 (CanLII), [2008] 3 SCR 560&lt;/ref&gt; England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies Act 2006]] section 172; ''[[Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd]]'' [1942] Ch 304&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporations Act 2001]], section 180(2); ''[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich]]'' [2009] NSWSC 1229&lt;/ref&gt;

To challenge the actions of a corporation's [[board of directors]], a plaintiff assumes "the burden of providing evidence that directors, in reaching their challenged decision, breached any one of the triads of their [[fiduciary duty]] — [[good faith]], [[Duty of Loyalty|loyalty]], or [[Duty of care (business associations)|due care]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Cede &amp; Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345, 361 (Del. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Failing to do so, a plaintiff "is not entitled to any remedy unless the transaction constitutes waste... [that is,] the exchange was so one-sided that no business person of ordinary, sound judgment could conclude that the corporation has received adequate consideration".&lt;ref&gt;''In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation'', 906 A.2d 27 (Del. June 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Given that the directors cannot ensure corporate success, the business judgment rule specifies that the court will not review the business decisions of directors who performed their duties (1) in [[good faith]]; (2) with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the directors reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aronson v. Lewis]]'', 473 A.2d 805, 812 (1984); ''[[Kaplan v. Centex Corp.]]'', Del. Ch., 284 A.2d 119, 124 (1971); ''[[Robinson v. Pittsburgh Oil Refinery Corp.]]'', Del. Ch., 14 Del. Ch. 193, 126 A. 46 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their duty of care, directors have a duty not to waste corporate assets by overpaying for property or employment services. The business judgment rule is very difficult to overcome and courts will not interfere with directors unless it is clear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Aronson v. Lewis]]'', 473 A.2d 805, 812 (1984); ''[[Puma v. Marriott]]'', Del. Ch., 283 A.2d 693, 695 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, the business judgment rule creates a strong [[presumption]] in favor of the board of directors of a corporation, freeing its members from possible liability for decisions that result in harm to the corporation. The presumption is that "in making business decisions not involving direct self-interest or self-dealing, corporate directors act on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that their actions are in the corporation's best interest."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, it exists so that a board will not suffer legal action simply from a bad decision. As the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] has said, a court "will not substitute its own notions of what is or is not sound business judgment"&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;''[https://law.justia.com/cases/delaware/supreme-court/1971/280-a-2d-717-3.html Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien]'', 280 A.2d 717, 720 (Del. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; if "the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien]]'', 280 A.2d 717, 720 (Del. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duty of care and duty of loyalty==

Although a distinct common law concept from [[Duty of care (business associations)|duty of care]], [[duty of loyalty]] is often evaluated by courts in certain cases dealing with violations by the board. While the business judgment rule is historically linked particularly to the duty of care standard of conduct,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'', 488 A.2d 858 (1985), at 872-73. The judgment notes "A director's duty to exercise an informed business judgment is in the nature of a duty of care, as distinguished from a duty of loyalty."&lt;/ref&gt; shareholders who sue the directors often charge both the duty of care and duty of loyalty violations. 

This forced the courts to evaluate duty of care (employing the business judgment rule standard of review) together with duty of loyalty violations that involve self-interest violations (as opposed to gross incompetence with duty of care). Violations of the duty of care are reviewed under a [[gross negligence]] standard, as opposed to simple [[negligence]]. 

Consequently, over time, one of the points of review that has entered the business judgment rule was the prohibition against self-interest transactions. Conflicting interest transactions occur when a director, who has a conflicting interest with respect to a transaction, knows that she or a related person is (1) a party to the transaction; (2) has a beneficial financial interest in, or closely linked to, the transaction that the interest would reasonably be expected to influence the director's judgment if she were to vote on the transaction; or (3) is a director, general partner, agent, or employee of another entity with whom the corporation is transacting business and the transaction is of such importance to the corporation that it would in the normal course of business be brought before the board.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Guth v. Loft]]'', 5 A.2d 503 (1939), at 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard of review==
The following test was constructed in the opinion for ''Grobow v. Perot'', 539 A.2d 180 (Del. 1988), as a guideline for satisfaction of the business judgment rule.  Directors in a business should:
*act in good faith;
*act in the best interests of the corporation;
*act on an informed basis;
*not be wasteful;
*not involve self-interest (duty of loyalty concept plays a role here).

==Rationale==
Under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], the business judgment rule is the offspring of the fundamental principle, codified in Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(a), that the business and affairs of a Delaware corporation are managed by or under its board of directors. In carrying out their managerial roles, directors are charged with an unyielding fiduciary duty to the corporation.&lt;ref name="Gorkom"&gt;''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'', 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule is the recognition by courts that, in the inherently risky environment of business, Boards of Directors need to be free to take risks without a constant fear of lawsuits affecting their judgment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gagliardi v. TriFoods Int’l Inc.'', 683 A.2d 1049, 1052 (Del. Ch. 1996) (setting out rationale for the rule).&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption raised by the Business Judgment Rule may be rebutted by the [[plaintiff]]. "The business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company. Thus, the party attacking a board decision as uninformed must rebut the presumption that its business judgment was an informed one."&lt;ref name="Gorkom"/&gt; Further, rebuttal typically requires a showing that the defendants violated duty of care or loyalty (with courts assuming director's good faith otherwise). 

If the plaintiff can show that an action should not be protected by the business judgment rule (such as when a director decides to give over a certain percentage of the company's profits to charity (duty of care violation) or lines his/her own pockets with company's money (self-interest/duty of loyalty violation)), then the burden will shift to the defendant to show that the action meets the burden of [[good faith]]/rational decision. In many cases, it is relatively easy for a director to find some rational reason for his actions and, with the courts using the business judgment rule, the case will likely be dismissed (U.S. courts disdain getting involved in business matters). All directors must have the option of vetoing the decision.

Frequently, the winning cases for plaintiffs involving the business judgment rule involve acts constituting corporate waste. Also, note that some Board decisions lie outside the business judgment rule.  For instance, in the takeover context, courts will apply the more stringent [[Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.|''Unocal'' test]], also called intermediate scrutiny. Illegal decisions are also not protected by the business judgment rule. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Miller v. American Telephone %26 Telegraph Co.]]'' 507 F.2d 759 (3rd Cir. 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest cases, ''[[Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', ruled, for example, that "courts of equity will not interfere in the management of the directors unless it is clearly made to appear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, or refuse to declare a dividend when the corporation has a surplus of net profits which it can, without detriment to its business, divide among its stockholders, and when a refusal to do so would amount to such an abuse of discretion as would constitute a fraud, or breach of that good faith which they are bound to exercise towards the stockholders."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">'''Contract B''' is a concept in Canadian law.
A '''Contract B''' is formed when an Owner formally accepts a Bid or, colloquially, a submission of price.  Only a single Contract B is formed between the Owner and the successful bidder.  Tied to the concept of [[Contract A]], '''Contract B''' is a place holder in the concept, a marker at the end of a formalized process of equitable treatment of both bidders and owners&lt;ref&gt;Government Procurement, Fourth Edition, by Paul Emanuelli, p. 125, Published by Lexis Nexis Canada, Year of Publication: 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-433-47454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In many ways it is more of an academic detail within the Contract A - Contract B concept, but can also be thought of as a label for the actual construction contract.

The '''convention of disclosure''' requires that all material facts must be [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|disclosed]] in the [[financial statement]]s. For example, in the case of sundry debtors, not only the total amount of sundry debtors should be disclosed, but also the amount of good and secured debtors, the amount of good but unsecured debtors and amount of doubtful debts should be stated.This does not mean disclosure of each and every item of information. It only means disclosure of such information which is of significance to owners, investors and creditors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5477">[[Image:Matrix-46.PNG|thumb|An example of a [[Data Matrix]] marked on the surface]]

'''Direct part marking''' ('''DPM''') is a process to permanently mark parts with product information including serial numbers, part numbers, date codes, and  [[barcodes]]. This is done to allow the tracking of parts through the full [[Product life cycle management|life cycle]].

The interpretation of 'permanent' often depends on the context the part is used. In the [[aerospace]] industry an aircraft part may be in service for over 30 years. Within telecom and computer industries the life cycle may only last a few years.

DPM is often used by automotive, aerospace, and electronic manufacturers to facilitate a reliable identification of their parts. This can assist in data logging for safety, warranty issues and satisfy regulatory requirements. Also the [[United States Department of Defense]] demands a physical mark on tangible assets in conjunction with the [[IUID|Item Unique Identification]].

==Barcode types==
There are many ways to encode an information to a machine-readable code. The preferred codes are the [[Data Matrix]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Andreeta
 | first =  M. R. B. 
 | last2 = Cunha
 | first2 =  L. S. 
 | last3 = Vales
 | first3 =  L. F. 
 | last4 = Caraschi
 | first4 =  L. C.
 | last5 = Jasinevicius
 | first5 =  R. G.
 | year = 2011
 | title = Bidimensional codes recorded on an oxide glass surface using a continuous wave CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser
 | journal = Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering
 | volume =  21
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 025004
 | doi = 10.1088/0960-1317/21/2/025004
 | bibcode=2011JMiMi..21b5004A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[QR Code]]. Data Matrix is used by Motorola.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmh.com/article/CA6437021.html Direct part marking: The next hot trend in automatic identification&lt;/ref&gt; It is also preferred by [[NASA]] to mark parts. In the automotive industries also the [[QR Code]] is used. This is founded in the fact that this code was initially developed by [[Denso|Denso Wave]] (a global automotive components manufacturer) for tracking parts in vehicle manufacturing.

==Marking methods==
Methods to produce a permanent mark on parts are:
* Indenting
* Embossing
* [[Coining_(metalworking)|Coining]]
* [[Abrasive blasting]]
* Adhesive dispensing
* [[Casting|Cast]], [[forge]] or [[mold]]
* [[Dot peen]]
* [[Scribe]]
* [[Industrial etching|Electro-chemical etching]]
* [[Embroidery]]
* [[Engraving]]/milling
* [[Laser engraving|Laser marking]]
* LaserShot peening
* Liquid metal jet
* [[Stencil]] (mechanical cut, photo process, laser cut)

Other methods like manual metal stamp, vibro-etch and embossing were not suitable to successfully apply micro size (1/32- to 15/64-inch square), high density machine-readable symbols.&lt;ref&gt;https://standards.nasa.gov/documents/viewdoc/3314928/3314928 NASA-STD-6002D&lt;/ref&gt;

Indenting, Embossing, and Coining are common methods for high speed marking of parts. Such as security seals, keys, small parts, and data tags. Specifically for man readable data. Laser, Scribe, and Dot Peen marking are incapable of keeping up with high volume production methods. Laser Marking also lacks the permanence of Indenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://numberall.com/uid-blog/|title=Why You Should Choose Indent Marking for Your UID {{!}} Numberall|date=2017-09-01|work=Numberall Stamp &amp; Tool Co., Inc.|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marking method selection factors===
The marking method depends on a number of different factors:
* Part function&lt;br /&gt;Non-intrusive marking methods are recommended for parts used in safety critical applications like aircraft engines or high pressure and high stress systems.
* Part geometry&lt;br /&gt;It is more difficult to place a Data Matrix on a curved surface than it is on a flat surface.
* Surface&lt;br /&gt;Highly polished metal surfaces should be textured to reduce glare prior to marking. The textured area should extend one symbol width beyond the borders of marking.
* Part Size&lt;br /&gt;When a 2D Symbol is used, the size of the part is not a relevant factor as the available marking area is reduced to below 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch square.
* Operating environment / age life&lt;br /&gt;It should be controlled, if the used marking method can survive in its intended environment and remain readable for the life cycle of the part.
* [[Surface finish|Surface roughness]] / Finish&lt;br /&gt;A rough surface is more challenging for a 2D barcode as the data elements can be recognized appropriately. The surface roughness levels should be limited to 8 micro-inches for dot-peen marking, laser and scribe systems can make a readable mark in rougher surfaces. The laser systems burn a "quiet zone" first and then the 2D code. The scribe method provides a high resolution 2D mark that makes the part readily readable in most cast surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[Scribe 2D code on cast surfaces]http://columbiamt.com/CMT-Square-Dot-Marking/Cast_Surface.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Surface thickness&lt;br /&gt;Surface thickness must be taken into account when applying intrusive markings to prevent deformation or excessive weakening of the part. In most applications the marking depth should not exceed 1/10 the thickness of the part.

'''Thomas Douglas Baird Hay''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|size=85%}} (31 August 1876 – 19 April 1967) was a New Zealand cricketer who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]] from 1893 to 1907. He was later a cricket administrator and a prominent Auckland [[sharebroker]].

==Playing career==
A middle-order, and later opening, batsman and occasional bowler, Hay made his first-class debut for Auckland in 1893-94. In 1894-95 he made 55, the highest score of the match, when Auckland beat [[Hawke's Bay cricket team|Hawke's Bay]] by five wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4283.html| title = Hawke's Bay v Auckland 1894-95| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that innings his record was modest in his early years, and he made only 228 runs at an average of 12.66 in 11 matches over six seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/22/22084/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = Douglas Hay batting by season| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he played for a [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand XV]] against the touring [[Australia cricket team|Australians]] in 1896-97, batting at number nine and scoring 10 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/131/131809.html| title = New Zealand v Australians 1896-97| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took 5 for 10 off nine overs to finish off the [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] first innings later that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4687.html| title = Wellington v Auckland 1896-97| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1900-01, he was the highest scorer in New Zealand, with 292 runs at 41.71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/NZ/1900-01_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class batting 1900-01| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in January 1901, opening the batting against [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]], he made 37 and 60 (Auckland's top score)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5596.html| title = Canterbury v Auckland 1900-01| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then, a few days later, he made 144 and 20 not out against Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5598.html| title = Wellington v Auckland 1900-01| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay's 144 was Auckland's first century in their 38th match of first-class cricket. After Wellington had made 397 in their first innings, Auckland lost wickets steadily and were 112 for 7 at one stage. Hay "took over two hours to make his first 50, [but] in the next hour and a-half rattled on nearly double that number ... just when Auckland's plight seemed hopeless, he let out in most brilliant style and found the boundary time after time with powerful drives and leg strokes ... his 144 was a remarkable display of defence combined with hitting". Having gone in first, he was last out with Auckland's total at 262.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Auckland Star]]'', 9 January 1901, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After those few days of success he returned to his previous form, and in 10 first-class matches after 1900-01 he made only 169 runs at 9.38. He was selected for New Zealand in two matches against [[Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1902–03|Lord Hawke's visiting English team]] in 1902-03, but made only 28 runs in four innings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Neely]] &amp; Richard Payne, ''Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985'', Moa, Auckland, 1986, pp. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; He captained [[North Island cricket team|North Island]] against [[South Island cricket team|South Island]] in 1903-04, and played his last game for Auckland in 1906-07.

==Later life==
He was chairman and one of the original trustees of the [[Eden Park]] Trust Board.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1968, p. 1000.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the first [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927|New Zealand team to tour England]], in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=N.Z. Cricket Tour: Aucklander Made Manager|journal=Auckland Star|date=21 December 1926|volume=LVII|issue=302|page= 12|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19261221.2.132.2|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 20 years out of the first-class game, and at the age of 50, he played in the minor first-class match against [[Royal Navy Cricket Club|Royal Navy]], batting at number 11 and scoring 2 not out.&lt;ref&gt;Neely &amp; Payne, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Auckland Stock Exchange for 62 years.&lt;ref&gt;David Grant, ''Bulls, Bears and Elephants: A History of the New Zealand Stock Exchange'', Victoria University Press, Wellington, 1997, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1957 New Year Honours]] he was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40962 |date=1 January 1957 |page=46 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Ethna, who died in 1956, had three sons.

Hay died in Auckland in 1967 and his ashes were buried at Purewa Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purewa.co.nz/details.asp?id=18664&amp;type=Ashes%20Burial |title=Burial &amp; cremation details |date= |website= |publisher=Purewa Cemetery and Crematorium |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8851">The '''Dow Jones Transportation Average''' ('''DJTA''', also called the "Dow Jones Transports") is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[stock market index]] from [[S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices]] of the transportation sector, and is the most widely recognized gauge of the American transportation sector. It is the oldest stock index still in use, even older than its better-known relative, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA).&lt;ref name="street"&gt;{{cite web |title= Dow Jones Transportation Average |work= Street Authority web site |url= http://www.streetauthority.com/terms/index/transportation.asp |accessdate= 2010-04-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090206224553/http://www.streetauthority.com/terms/index/transportation.asp |archivedate= 2009-02-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Dow Jones Transportation Average.png|thumb|Dow Jones Transportation Average 1896–2012]]

The index is a running average of the stock prices of twenty transportation corporations, with each stock's price weighted to adjust for [[stock split]]s and other factors.&lt;ref name="street"/&gt; As a result, it can change at any time the markets are open. The figure mentioned in news reports is usually the figure derived from the prices at the close of the market for the day.

Changes in the index's composition are rare, and generally occur only after corporate acquisitions or other dramatic shifts in a component's core business.  Should such an event require that one component be replaced, the entire index is reviewed.&lt;ref name=djt20100408&gt;{{cite web |title= Dow Jones Transportation Average |work= official web site |url= http://www.djaverages.com/?view=transportation&amp;page=overview |accessdate= 2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The average was created on July 3, 1884, by [[Charles Dow]], co-founder of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] &amp; Company, as part of the "Customer's Afternoon Letter". At its inception, it consisted of eleven [[transport]]ation companies—nine [[railroad]]s and two non-rail companies:
*[[Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway]]&lt;!--sources say simply "St. Paul" - this is my best guess--&gt;
*[[Chicago and North Western Railway]]
*[[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]
*[[Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway]]&lt;!--sources say simply "Lake Shore" but there was no major Lake Shore Railroad, and this was known as the Lake Shore, though it was part of the New York Central--&gt;
*[[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]]
*[[Missouri Pacific Railway]]
*[[New York Central Railroad]]
*[[Northern Pacific Railroad]] [[preferred stock]]
*[[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] (not a railroad)
*[[Union Pacific Railway]]
*[[Western Union]] (not a railroad)

As a result of the dominating presence of railroads, the Transportation Average was often referred to as "rails" in financial discussions in the early and middle part of the 20th century.

==Use in Dow theory==

The Transportation Average is an important factor in [[Dow theory]].

==Price history==

In 1964, the index first broke 200, slightly over where it was in 1929.

In 1983, the index first broke 500. In 1987, the index broke 1000. It closed at 2146.89 on March 9, 2009, having a low coincident with some other indices; this was a bit above its low of 1942.19 on March 11, 2003.

The index broke above the mid-5000s to begin a run of record highs on January 15, 2013, at a time when the better-known Industrials stood about 5% below all-time highs achieved more than five years earlier. By May, the Industrials and all other major indexes except the NASDAQ group were making all-time highs, including the Transports, which reached new closing and intraday records above the 6,500 level. On October 24, 2013, the Transports closed at 7,022.79, for its first close above 7,000 points. It closed the year at a record high of 7,400.57. On May 27, 2014, it first closed above 8,000 points.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/28/us-markets-stocks-idUSKBN0E815520140528 S&amp;P 500 falls shy of a record, breaks four days of gains]&lt;/ref&gt; The index closed above 9000 on November 10, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stock Market News for November 11, 2014 - Market News - NASDAQ.com|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/stock-market-news-for-november-11-2014-market-news-cm412834}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of 2014, the index hit 9139.92. At the close of 2015, the index hit 7508.71, a loss of 17.85% on the year.

'''Downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]]''' is the central business district of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and is located along the [[Mississippi River]] between [[Interstate 40]] to the north, [[Interstate 55]] to the south and I-240 to the east, where it abuts [[Midtown Memphis]].

It is home to the [[Memphis Redbirds]], the AAA affiliate of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] NBA team.

==History==
{{Main|History of Memphis, Tennessee}}
[[File:Riverboats at Memphis.jpg|thumb|right|The Memphis river landing (1906)]]Downtown is the oldest part of the city and includes the riverfront and the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi river. The founders of Memphis dedicated the riverfront to the public "now and forever" as long as the public use continued.  The land overlooking the riverfront was originally planned to become a "public promenade" to be called ''Mississippi Row''. The upper riverfront became the site of the river landing where [[steamboat]]s were loaded with [[cotton]] and other goods in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Between 1844 and 1886 the river landing was paved with [[limestone]] and [[granite]] [[cobblestone]]s brought in from the [[upper Midwest]].  This created what is today the largest intact Mississippi River landing still in existence, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;http://river.freshbits.com/library/2000/05/on-memphis-waterfront-master-plan-must.html Clubb, Deborah M. ''On the Memphis Waterfront: Master Plan Must Account for What the Founders Wanted: A Public Promenade'' Commercial Appeal, Sunday, May 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion of the [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] in 1865 near Memphis was one of the worst marine disasters in history.

There are several historic residences downtown, particularly in the [[Victorian Village, Memphis|Victorian Village]] neighborhood. Other historic homes include the Hunt-Phelan House (1830), the [[Magevney House]] (ca. 1835) and the [[Burkle Estate]] (1849).  The Burkle home and the Hunt Phelan House (533 Beale Street) were reputed to have been part of the underground railroad by which escaped slaves made their way to freedom prior to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennesseeanytime.org/homework/historicsites/huntphel.html Hunt-Phelann House.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313033854/http://www.tennesseeanytime.org/homework/historicsites/huntphel.html |date=March 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downtown Airport===
In 1959, the Memphis Downtown Airport was opened on [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]], which at that time was called City Island. The one-runway airport could be reached by a pontoon-boat ferry and was used mostly by businessmen and shoppers. The Downtown Airport was closed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3424">'''Enterprise asset management''' ('''EAM''') involves the management of the maintenance of physical assets of an organization throughout each asset's lifecycle. EAM is used to plan, optimize, execute, and track the needed maintenance activities with the associated priorities, skills, materials, tools, and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcweb.com/blog/what-enterprise-asset-management-eam/|title=What is Enterprise Asset Management - EAM? |website=www.ARCweb.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13|first=Ralph|last=Rio|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413193545/https://www.arcweb.com/blog/what-enterprise-asset-management-eam|archive-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers the design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance and decommissioning or replacement of [[Physical plant|plant]], equipment and facilities.

"Enterprise" refers to the scope of the assets in an Enterprise across departments, locations, facilities and, potentially, supporting business functions eg; Finance &amp; GL, Human Resources and Payroll.  Various assets are managed by the modern enterprises at present.  The assets may be fixed assets like buildings, plants, machineries or moving assets like vehicles, ships, moving equipments etc.  The lifecycle management of the high value physical assets require regressive planning and execution of the work. 

==History==
EAM arose as an extension of the [[Computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS) which is usually defined as a system for the computerisation of the maintenance of physical assets.&lt;ref name="IBM-EAM"&gt;{{Citation|title=IBM Solution Approach For Enterprise Asset Management|first1=Katie|last1=Doyle|first2=Jerry|last2=Saulman|first3=Bill|last3=Cary|version=1.2|publisher=IBM|id=Introduction|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enterprise asset management software ==
Enterprise asset management software is a computer software that handles every aspect of running a public works or asset-intensive organization. Enterprise asset management (EAM) software applications include features such as asset life-cycle management, preventive maintenance scheduling, warranty management, integrated mobile wireless handheld options and portal-based software interface. Rapid development and availability of mobile devices also affected EAM software which now often supports [[Mobile enterprise asset management]].&lt;ref name="CWdawn2000"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Computer Weekly]]|title=Dawn of the age of smart assets|last=Gurton|first=Annie|date=November 2000|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Dawn-of-the-age-of-smart-assets|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evangelis''' or '''Evangelos Zappas''' ({{lang-el|Ευαγγέλης/Ευάγγελος Ζάππας}}; {{lang-ro|Evanghelie Zappa}}, 23 August 1800&amp;ndash;19 June 1865) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] patriot, [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and businessman who spent most of his life in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2009|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Trager|1979|p=654}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Landry103/&gt; He is recognized today as a founder of the [[modern Olympic Games]], who sponsored the Olympic Games of 1859, 1870, 1875, and 1888 and preceded the Olympic Games that came under the auspices of the [[International Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name=Decker273/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landry|Landry|Yerlès|1991|loc=David C. Young, "Myths and Mist Surrounding the Revival of the Olympic Games: the Hidden Story", p. 108}}: "Zappas the real founder of the modern Games was aging and ailing, ready to pass the torch to a successor."&lt;/ref&gt; These Games, known at the time simply as Olympics, came before the founding of the International Olympic Committee. The legacy of Evangelis Zappas, as well as the legacy of his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]], was also used to fund the Olympic Games of 1896.&lt;ref name="Zappeion Megaro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zappeion Culture and Exhibition Center|year=2007|url=http://www.zappeion.gr/en/en_history.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his youth, Zappas joined the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1832), achieving the rank of Major and fighting in several significant battles. Following Greek independence, he moved to [[Wallachia]] where he had a successful career as a businessman, becoming one of the richest men of that time in [[Eastern Europe]]. Aside from being the only major sponsor of the Olympic revival at that time, Zappas's philanthropy also included contributions toward the foundation of several Greek institutions and schools as well as sports and exhibition facilities.

==Biography==

===Early life, military career, and later career in Wallachia===
Evangelis Zappas was born of a [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry in 1800 in the village of [[Labovë e Madhe|Labovo]], near [[Tepelenë]], (modern [[Gjirokastër County]], [[Albania]]), when the region was still under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref name=Decker273/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landry103/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerlach25&gt;{{harvnb|Gerlach|2004|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerlach|2004|p=37}}: "Zappas born to a Greek family in 1800..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownell&gt;{{harvnb|Brownell|2008|loc=Susan Brownell, "Introduction: Bodies before Boas, Sport before the Launcher Left", pp. 1–58: [p. 36] "The wealthy Greek merchant who founded the Olympiad, Evangelis Zappas, had intended to revive the ancient Olympic Games."; Alexander Kitroeff, "Chapter 8: Greece and the 1904 "American Olympics", pp. 301–323: [p. 303] "Greece's own revival of the ancient Olympics, in the form of the Zappas Olympics, named after Evangelis Zappas, a Greek diaspora merchant who provided the funds..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappas did not receive any education during his childhood.&lt;ref name=Landry103&gt;{{harvnb|Landry|Landry|Yerlès|1991|loc=David C. Young, "Myths and Mist Surrounding the Revival of the Olympic Games: the Hidden Story", p. 103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He left his village at the age of 13 and enrolled as a [[mercenary]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] militia of the local ruler [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]].&lt;ref name=Ruches79&gt;{{harvnb|Ruches|1967|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Matthews45&gt;{{harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappas became a member of the Greek patriotic organization [[Filiki Eteria]] and joined his compatriots when the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out in 1821.&lt;ref name=Matthews45/&gt; During this period, Zappas reached the rank of Major in the revolutionary army and became a personal friend of the [[Souliot]] captain, [[Markos Botsaris]].&lt;ref name=Matthews45/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill16/&gt; After Botsaris's death in 1823, Zappas served under various military commanders of the independence struggle, such as [[Dimitrios Panourgias]], [[Kitsos Tzavelas]], and [[Michail Spyromilios]]. He participated in several major conflicts, such as the siege of [[Souli]], the [[First Siege of Missolonghi|first siege of Missolonghi]] and the [[Battle of Peta]]. In his later correspondence with a Greek official, he claimed that he was wounded five times during the war.&lt;ref name=Ruches79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Decker|2005|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, Zappas emigrated to [[Wallachia]] and made a fortune in land and agriculture.&lt;ref name=Matthews45/&gt; In the 1850s, Zappas was considered one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1996|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1865, his total wealth was estimated at six million gold [[Greek drachma|drachmas]].&lt;ref name=Ruches80/&gt;

===Revival of the Olympic Games===
{{See also|Zappas Olympics}}
The idea of reviving the ancient Olympic Games had been raised from time to time during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by [[romanticism]] and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2009|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, the romantic poet [[Panagiotis Soutsos]], in his work ''Dialogue of the Dead'', proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek state]], as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Landry|Landry|Yerlès|1991|loc=David C. Young, "Myths and Mist Surrounding the Revival of the Olympic Games: the Hidden Story", pp. 102, 114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, archaeologist [[Ernst Curtius]] stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived.&lt;ref name=Hill16/&gt;

[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the [[Panathinaiko|Panathenaic Stadium]] (1906).]]

Zappas was notably inspired by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition through his own efforts and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1856, he sent a letter through diplomatic channels to [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] of [[Greece]], offering to fund the revival of the Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors.&lt;ref name=Gerlach25/&gt; However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were a throwback to ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]], the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brownell|2008|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events.&lt;ref name=Landry103/&gt; King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four-year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.&lt;ref name=Hill16&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 1859 the first Olympic Games was held, in a city square in central [[Athens]]. These athletic contests were the first Olympic Games of modern times with the provenance of ancient Greek roots and the intention of using an, as yet unready, ancient Greek stadium. That stadium, the [[Panathinaiko|Panathenaic Stadium]], was first used for a modern Olympic Games in 1870 and for the first time since the ancient [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic]] and Olympic Games. The athletes competed in a variety of disciplines, similar to that of the ancient Olympic Games: running, [[Discus throw|discus]], [[javelin throw]]ing, [[wrestling]], [[jumping]], and [[pole climbing]].&lt;ref name=Landry103/&gt;

Zappas left a fortune for the funding of future Olympiads to be held at the Panathenian stadium. He died in 1865. His immense fortune was used for the construction of permanent sporting facilities in Athens, as well as for the continuation of the Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerlach|2004|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also instructed on the building of the [[Zappeion]] exhibition and conference center, which is named in his honour and that of his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]].&lt;ref name="Zappeion Megaro"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Re-establishment of the Olympic Games in modern times===
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 27 Zappeion.jpg|thumb|Zappeion exhibition center.]]

After Zappas's death, and wholly due to the Greek government ignoring Zappas's instructions to refurbish the stadium in marble, it was necessary to refurbish the [[Panathinaiko|Panathenian stadium]] a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the [[Olympic spirit#General concept|Olympic concept]].&lt;ref name=Rühl13&gt;{{harvnb|Rühl|2004|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Young201&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1996|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad.&lt;ref name=Young148&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1996|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general.&lt;ref name=Young148/&gt; Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's [[National Garden of Athens|National Garden]], was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named [[Zappeion]] after him.&lt;ref name=Ruprecht152&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprecht|2002|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.&lt;ref name=Rühl13/&gt;

[[File:Evaggelos Zappas statue Athens.jpg|thumb|upright=.7273|left|Statue of Zappas in front of the Zappeion (made by [[Ioannis Kossos]]).]]

Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]], from the United Kingdom, further developed his Olympian Class sports events held in Much Wenlock in the 1850s, by adopting some events from the 1859 Athens Olympic Games into the programme of future Wenlock Olympian Games. [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]] from Paris, France, was, in part, inspired by Dr. Brookes, and went on to found the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landry|Landry|Yerlès|1991|loc=David C. Young, "Myths and Mist Surrounding the Revival of the Olympic Games: the Hidden Story", p. 102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor David C. Young, of the University of Florida (Gainesville), noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Had it not been for Zappas, the Athens Games of 1896 surely would not have taken place. Zappas's actions, his will and the previous tradition of Zappas Olympic Games had made [Crown Prince] [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] [of Greece] an advocate of Olympic Games before the formation of the IOC in 1894."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1996|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Apart from his efforts to revive the Olympics, Evangelis Zappas made several philanthropic donations towards the foundation of schools, libraries and other similar institutions all over the Ottoman-occupied world, and notably their birthplace, [[Epirus]]. Greek schools were founded and expanded in several Greek-populated villages and towns, such as Labovo, Lekli, Nivani, Dhroviani, [[Filiates]], [[Delvina]], [[Permet]]. In [[Constantinople]], education facilities were also founded that included nurseries, primary and secondary schools, which were collectively known as the Zappeion Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vassiadis|2007|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a large amount of money was deposited in the [[National Bank of Greece]] to provide scholarships for Greek agricultural students in order to conduct postgraduate studies in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Ruches80&gt;{{harvnb|Ruches|1967|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the anti-Greek [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in 1955, the facilities of the Zappeion female college in the Turkish capital were vandalized by the fanatical mob and a statue of him was broken into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Σεπτέμβριος 1955: η τρίτη άλωση |url=http://wwk.kathimerini.gr/kath/7days/1995/09/10091995.pdf |publisher=Η Καθημερινή: Επτά Ημέρες |date=10 September 1995 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331023209/http://wwk.kathimerini.gr/kath/7days/1995/09/10091995.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality and resting place===
[[File:Zappeion-3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Crypt of Evangelos Zappas at the [[Zappeion]].]]
Evangelis Zappas was often described as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, he was a man of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts.&lt;ref name="Zappeion Megaro"/&gt; His cousin, [[Konstantinos Zappas]], was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in [[Romania]], where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion.&lt;ref name=Young201/&gt; Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref name=Ruprecht152/&gt;

== Biography ==
Boswell earned his undergraduate and Masters in Computer Science at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Ontario]], Canada.
While he was a student and after he earned his masters in 1980, Boswell worked under [[J. Wesley Graham]], a senior Computer Scientist at the University of Waterloo, who had broadly managed teams at Waterloo that developed several widely used [[compiler|computer language compilers]].

One of the first languages that was his design was the ″[[Waterloo Systems Language]]″, intended for systems programming, which introduced some new [[control flow|flow control constructs]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''Facundo Bacardí Masso'''  ({{lang-ca|Facund Bacardí i Massó}}, {{IPA-ca|fəˈkund bəkəɾˈði j məˈso|IPA}}) (Oct 14, 1814 – May 9, 1886) was a Spanish businessman who, in 1862, founded the eponymous [[Bacardi]] rum distillery.

==Biography==
Bacardí was born in [[Sitges]] ([[Provinces of Spain|province]] of [[province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Spain]]), son of a family of [[bricklayer]]s. He followed his older brothers to Cuba, finding employment in their general store in [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. Over time, he saved up his own capital, and in 1844 he established his own mercantile shop.

Just three months earlier he had married Amalia Moreau, a woman from a very prosperous family of [[French Haitians|Franco-Haitian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8mzAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=lucia+victoria+moreau+haitiana&amp;dq=lucia+victoria+moreau+haitiana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNg-Ol6f_SAhVL4yYKHYh_AtoQ6AEIITAB |title=Oro blanco: una historia empresarial del ron cubano |author=Miranda, Miguel Bonera |page=75 |year=2000 |publisher=Lugus |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv-iCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=lucia+victoria+moreau+haitiana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNg-Ol6f_SAhVL4yYKHYh_AtoQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lucia%20victoria%20moreau%20haitiana&amp;f=false |title=Siempre la memoria, mejor que el olvido: Entrevistas, crónicas y reportajes selectos |author=Padura, Leonardo |page=34 |publisher=Verbum Editorial |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsQjAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=lucia+victoria+moreau+haitiana&amp;dq=lucia+victoria+moreau+haitiana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNg-Ol6f_SAhVL4yYKHYh_AtoQ6AEILjAD |title=Cuba internacional, Issues 223-228 |author=Press |page=263|year=1988 |publisher=Agencia Prensa Latina |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both would prove to be sources of capital for Facundo's business ventures. Facundo and Amalia went on to have a number of children, many of whom would play important parts in building the rum business for which the family became famous: Emilio was born in 1844, Juan in 1846, Facundo Jr. in 1848, María in 1851, José in 1857, and Amalia Jr. in 1861.

An earthquake followed by a cholera epidemic devastated Santiago in 1852, claiming Juan and María and sending Facundo and his family to Catalonia for a number of months to escape. Upon his return, Facundo found his store looted and business conditions in Santiago poor in the wake of the disaster and amid a global slump in sugar, the mainstay of the economy. Facundo's business wasn't able to recover, and it was bankrupt in 1855.

Soon after, Facundo began to experiment with the process of distilling rum. Previously, rum was a crude, low quality beverage. Facundo, with the help of a French Cuban named José León Boutellier, a tenant of Clara Astie, began to experiment with methods of distillation. Exactly what techniques they developed are debated, but some combination of quicker-fermenting cognac yeast, charcol filtration, white oak barrel aging, and painful trial-and-error based adjustments of distillation and fermentation resulted in much more refined, tamer drink which they successfully sold through Facundo's brother's general store.

In 1862 the partners acquired a [[distillery]] and constituted the firm "Bacardí, Boutellier, and Company", using capital supplied by Facundo's younger brother José. Having started in retailing, Bacardi understood how to sell things, and realized that his innovative drink would benefit from good branding. He began to sign each shipment of rum with a bold "Bacardí M" (for Bacardi Massó); in addition, he used the now iconic bat as the brand's image.&lt;ref name="Gjelten"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gjelten|first=Tom |title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba|publisher=Viking|year=2008|page=23, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, the firm was reorganized. Facundo bought out his younger brother José, and his sons contributed some of their own capital and bought out most of Boutellier's stake as he declined in health. The new company was named simply "Bacardí and Company". The firm gained growing renown as its rum was sold throughout Cuba and even the wider world after winning prizes in international exhibitions. In 1877 Facundo retired, turning management of the company over to his sons [[Emilio Bacardí|Emilio]] (president) Facundo Jr. (master blender), and José (sales).

The ensuing period of Cuban history was politically tumultuous, as the society struggled against Spanish imperialism. Facundo was generally pro-Spanish,&lt;ref name="Gjelten"/&gt;
which partially restrained the liberal tendencies of his respectful sons. However, Emilio in particular became highly involved in nationalistic politics while running the business and became suspected by the authorities. During one of many sweeps by the loyalist security services, Emilio and Facundo himself were arrested. Facundo was released but Emilio was eventually imprisoned for four years, during which the business was operated by the remaining brothers with Facundo providing strategic advice from the prison.

Facundo lived to see Emilio released and the business to grow in fame, although not yet in financial strength.

[[File:MRT100CreativeCommonsRelease23June15(m).jpg|thumb|The Ferranti MRT-100]]'''The Ferranti Market Research Terminal (MRT)''' was, arguably, the world’s first application-specific handheld computer.&lt;ref&gt;Patent "''Data Recording Technique and Apparatus (Market Research Terminal)''" – GB19820022834, WO1983GB00195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1986) "''The Market Research Terminal &amp; Developments in Survey Research''", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 20 Issue: 2, pp.35 - 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed specifically for the [[market research]] sector as a means to augment the regular [[clipboard]] schemes that, at the time, were common-place, in [[Social research|social]] and [[market research]].&lt;ref&gt;"''The Digital Home: a New Locus of Social Science Research''". In The Handbook of Emergent Technologies in Social Research, Oxford University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ferranti]] Market Research Terminal (MRT) is also of historical significance to the computing industry since it marked the last original computer design from [[Ferranti]],  a long  established  business (started 1882) that had risen to fame through a collaboration [[Manchester University]] to produce the "[[Ferranti Mark 1|Mark 1]]", the world’s first commercial computer and later with [[Cambridge University]] producing the "[[Atlas (computer)|Atlas]]" and "[[Titan (computer)|Titan]]" computers which, at their peak, held around 25% of the computing market.

== History ==
[[Ferranti|Ferranti Plc]] produced two versions that were labelled the MRT-100 and MRT-200 and based on an original 1978 prototype called the ''Questronic'' which had been designed at [[Sheffield University]] as part of a collaboration between the Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering and the Department of Geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://victor.callaghan.info/time/ferranti-mrt/ Questronic website]&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to imagine the context of this product development in the late seventies, it is useful to remember that the [[IBM PC]] (which has brought the Windows desktops and laptops that are now commonplace!) was only introduced on 12 August 1981. If one ignores calculators, then [[handheld computers]] appeared in July 1980 with, perhaps, the first being the [[Tandy Pocket Computer]] (Radio Shack TRS-80 Pocket Computer). Later in the same year, Matsushita (now the Panasonic Corporation) produced a handheld computer marketed under the Panasonic and Quasar brand. However, these devices were, of course, general purpose handheld computers unlike the application-specific MRT introduced by [[Ferranti]]. A merger in 1989 with the American "International Signal &amp; Control Group" (ISC),  led to [[Ferranti]] going into bankruptcy in December 1994. With that came the end of the Ferranti MRT and, effectively, [[Ferranti]] with its long lineage of UK innovative computing and electronics research, development and manufacture.

== Product Description ==
An excellent description of the Ferranti MRT was given by Deborah Martell ([[Cardiff Business School]], [[University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]]) in the 1987 book, "Management Information Systems: The Technology Challenge" (edited by Nigel Piercy) in which she described the product as follows:
"''Accurate survey research is of utmost importance in marketing evaluations and NIT [new information technology] is improving this accuracy all the time. This has been shown by Rowley et-al in their description of the Questronic project at the University of Sheffield. The first commercialised product to evolve from this is the Ferranti Market Research Terminal (MRT). The MRT is a battery-operated, hand-held, data-capture terminal, which is an electronic replacement for the clipboard and pencil used for gathering information from consumers. This innovation offers real advantages for survey research, due to easier processing, since data is stored electronically, it is already in a form which can be directly entered into a computer. Likewise, the elimination of the data preparation stage decreases the errors created by human processing. More importantly survey results can be more topical since the MRT decreases the time delay in preparation. Other benefits accrue from decreased handling and stationary costs and increased interviewer productivity. Indeed the Questronic MRT procedures, with their instant processing abilities, allow more specific monitoring of TV effects. A particular attraction is the removal of the traditional “bottleneck” at the data preparation stage for input into the computer. Successful companies will, in the future, emphasise even more the matching of a product to the consumer requirements. Consequently, the old Henry Ford adage “you can have any colour you want, as long as its black” will be gone forever.''"&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A Martell, "''Marketing Information and New Technology''", Chapter 8 in the book, Management Information Systems: The Technology Challenge, edited by Nigel Piercy, published by Nichols Publishing Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-89397-260-6}},  p163, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the only thing to add to Deborah Martell’s description was that the MRT supported the easy transmission of collected data through telephone lines using a [[portable modem]] which, at the time, was cutting edge technology.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Questronic Project and the Ferranti MRT 100; A Boon For Survey Research''", Professional Geographer, 37(4), 1985. 459-463.&lt;/ref&gt; To put these developments into context, the [[Internet]] was only commercialized in 1995  when [[NSFNET]] was decommissioned and the last barriers to using it for commercial purposes were removed (so the Ferranti MRT was in use for over 10 years before the commercial Internet).

'''Frederick Cathcart''' (1859 - 1934) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[impresario]], who was the [[Clerk of the Course]] and [[Chairman]] of [[Cheltenham Racecourse]] from 1908 to 1934.  He was responsible for the development of Cheltenham as the world headquarters of [[National Hunt]] racing, establishing the [[Cheltenham Festival]] as the leading National Hunt event in the racing calendar, and for instigating two of its major races - the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] and the [[Champion Hurdle]].  In 1999, industry paper the [[Racing Post]] named him at number 11 in the list of ''100 Makers of 20th Century Racing''.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;

He was born in 1859, the son of a professional [[comedian]].  He joined [[racecourse]] management firm Pratt &amp; Co in 1895 and progressed to be senior partner.

In 1911 he gave the National Hunt Meeting (the precursor to the Cheltenham Festival) a permanent home at Cheltenham and set about expanding it.  Under his leadership, the inaugural runnings of the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] (1924) and [[Champion Hurdle]] (1927) were held.

On his death, one obituary read, "He was indefatigable in his efforts to increase the popularity and public appeal of the race meetings with which he was associated . . . Much of the success of the 'chasing at Cheltenham was due to Mr Cathcart's energy and enterprise."&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;

The [[Cathcart Challenge Cup]] (later replaced by the [[Ryanair Chase]]) at the Cheltenham Festival meeting was named in his honour.

'''Gianni Bulgari''' (born 1935) is an Italian [[jewelry designer]], businessman and socialite. He is a member of the [[Bulgari family]] of jewelers and led the [[Bulgari]] company from the 1960s into the 1980s. After leaving the family business, he was the chairman of [[Fila (company)|Fila]] from 1988 to 1998 and established his own luxury watchmaking and jewelry company GB-Enigma in 1989.

In 1975, his abduction made international news. His captors released him for a ransom of about $2 million.

==Early life==
Gianni Bulgari was born in 1935, the eldest son of Giorgio Bulgari (1890-1966). His brother [[Paolo Bulgari|Paolo]] was born in 1937 and [[Nicola Bulgari|Nicola]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=Hancocks&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgari|url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/content/bulgari|website=Hancocks|publisher=Hancocks|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Sotirio, was the founder of the Bulgari company.

Before actively joining the family business, Gianni graduated from law school and led a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy lifestyle]], which included a stint as a race car driver.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |first= |last= |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |volume=106 |year=2010 |isbn= |pages= |page= |chapter=Bulgari S.p.A. |accessdate= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After his father's death in 1966, Gianni led the company as co-chief executive with his cousin Marina.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulgari: the man, the enigma |author= |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/bulgari-the-man-the-enigma/2007/01/07/1168104862949.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |newspaper=The Age |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chairman and CEO of Bulgari in the early 1970s, Gianni initiated the internationalization of the company by opening shops in [[New York City|New York]], [[Geneva]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enigma.info/enigma/gianni-bulgari/ |title=Gianni Bulgari |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Enigma |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1975, Gianni made international news when he was abducted by masked men armed with pistols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italian Jeweler Gianni Bulgari Kidnapped by Three Masked Men |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RuEeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AWcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7375,6852136&amp;dq=gianni-bulgari&amp;hl=en |agency=Associated Press |date=15 March 1975 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demanded a $16 million ransom for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Playboy Who Wouldn't Carry a Gun Is Kidnapped for $16 Million |author= |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20065091,00.html |newspaper=People |date=31 March 1975 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, they released Gianni in exchange for about $2 million.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rome's Gianni Bulgari Hangs the Right Stuff Around the World's Richest Necks |author= |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20079304,00.html |newspaper=People |date=18 May 1981 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidnap Victim Released |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RjFcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mFUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4754,1758530&amp;dq=gianni-bulgari&amp;hl=en |agency=Associated Press |date=14 April 1975 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, establishing a new watch business and focusing on product design.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In 1985, Gianni resigned as CEO and in 1987, he left the family business after selling his one-third stake in the company to his brothers Nicola and Paolo.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1989, Gianni founded the luxury watchmaking company GB-Enigma in [[Neuchâtel]], Switzerland. In 2002, he began to focus full-time on the development of the GB-Enigma brand after relinquishing his other professional commitments.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; GB-Enigma opened its first store in Rome in 2005 and another in Geneva in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enigma.info/enigma/company-history/ |title=Company History |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Enigma |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launching its debut fine jewelry collection in 2011, the Italian fashion house [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.|Ferragamo]] collaborated with Gianni to create its Futurista, Vara, and Gancino jewelry lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ferragamo bling: The Italian fashion house recently launched its first jewellery collection |author= |url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/archive/monday/lifestyle/shopping/ferragamo-bling |newspaper=The Business Times |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the partnership, Gianni stated, "My task is to help Ferragamo get into the jewellery business with my knowhow and experience, but mixing it up with their experience and icons so that their jewellery is very recognisable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ferragamo: Fulfilling father’s dream of dressing from top to toe |author= |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bc715b5e-615b-11e1-8a8e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2BJ6kVdGj |newspaper=Financial Times |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

D'Acampo rose to fame as a regular chef on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] show ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''. He has since presented cookery programmes including ''[[Let's Do Lunch with Gino &amp; Mel|Let's Do Lunch]]'', ''[[There's No Taste Like Home]]'' and ''[[Gino's Italian Escape]]''.

==Career==
In 1995, aged 19, D'Acampo moved to London to work in ''The Orchard Restaurant'', [[Hampstead]], London and the ''Cambio Restaurant'' in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]].

D'Acampo co-owns Bontà Italia Ltd, a supplier of Italian ingredients and has a career in the development of ready meals, beginning with the [[Tesco|Tesco Finest]] range. This experience led to his first engagement as a guest on ''[[Great Food Live]]'' on [[Good Food|UKTV Food]] and the start of his television career.

In 2009, D'Acampo was crowned King of the Jungle after appearing in the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here! (UK series 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!]]''. After the show, D'Acampo and fellow contestant [[Stuart Manning]] were charged by the Australian police with animal cruelty for killing and cooking a rat on the show. However, the charges were later dropped after ITV accepted responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aislinn Laing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7186106/ITV-fined-1600-for-animal-cruelty-over-Im-a-Celebrity-rat-stunt.html |title=ITV fined £1,600 for animal cruelty over I'm a Celebrity rat stunt |work=The Telegraph |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Acampo has regularly appeared on the ITV series ''This Morning''. He launched his first iPhone app "Gino D'Acampo – Eating Italian" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gino-dacampo-eating-italian/id401698628?mt=8 |title=Gino D'Acampo – Eating Italian |publisher=iTunes Store |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2011 until 2014, D'Acampo and [[Melanie Sykes]] presented the daytime cookery programme ''Let's Do Lunch With Gino and Mel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/letsdolunch Roast turkey and all the trimmings!] itv.com. 19 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired for four series and three Christmas series from 2012 to 2014. D'Acampo hosts a Sunday afternoon cookery and discussion show on [[LBC 97.3]]. In 2011, D'Acampo presented the daytime [[ITV Food|cookery series]] ''There's No Taste Like Home'' for thirty episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/There%27s_No_Taste_Like_Home There's No Taste Like Home]. ukgameshows.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, D'Acampo has presented five series of ''Gino's Italian Escape'' on ITV.

In autumn 2014, D'Acampo filled in as a team captain for [[Holly Willoughby]] on the [[ITV2]] panel show ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'', while she went on maternity leave.

He visited cities including [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Margate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/tours/ginos-italian-escapes-the-live-tour|title=Gino's Italian Escape - The Live Tour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was confirmed that [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] had picked up ''Win Your Wish List'' for its Saturday night schedule, with Gino as host. The show is now called ''[[Gino's Win Your Wish List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/channel-5-adds-stellify-to-new-wish-list/|title=Channel 5 adds Stellify to new Wish List|website=c21Media.net|date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival is produced by [[Stellify Media]].

'''''Glengarry Glen Ross''''' is a 1992 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] adapted by [[David Mamet]] from his 1984 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Glengarry Glen Ross|play of the same name]], and directed by [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]. The film depicts two days in the lives of four [[real estate]] salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a [[Facilitator|trainer]] to "motivate" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired. It was filmed in New York City.&lt;ref name= "Bernstein, Richard"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bernstein | first = Richard | title = Despite the Odds, 'Glengarry' Is Being Filmed | work =[[The New York Times]] | date = August 15, 1991 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/15/movies/despite-the-odds-glengarry-is-being-filmed.html | accessdate = 2015-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as "[[Death of a Salesman|Death of a Fuckin' Salesman]]."&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ed Harris]], while being interviewed on {{cite episode | title = | episodelink = | series = Inside the Actors Studio | serieslink = Inside the Actors Studio | airdate = 2000-12-17 | season = 7 | number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.

The [[Film premiere|world premiere]] of the film was held at the [[49th Venice Film Festival]], where [[Jack Lemmon]] was awarded the [[Volpi Cup]] for Best Actor. [[Al Pacino]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Best Supporting Actor]] for his work in the film. The film grossed $10.7 million in [[North America]] on a $12.5 million budget.

==Plot==
The film depicts two days in the lives of four [[real estate]] salesmen who are supplied with [[Lead generation|leads]]: the names and phone numbers of [[Prospect (marketing)|prospects]]; they use deceitful and dubious tactics to make sales. Many of the leads rationed out by the office manager lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land.

Blake (Baldwin) is sent by Mitch and Murray, the owners of Premiere Properties, to motivate the sales team. Blake unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse on the salesmen and announces that only the top two will be allowed access to the more promising Glengarry leads and the rest of them will be fired.

Shelley "The Machine" Levene (Lemmon), a once powerful and successful salesman, now in a long-running slump and with a [[Chronic pain|chronically ill]] daughter in the hospital with an unknown medical condition, knows that he will lose his job soon if he cannot generate sales. He tries to persuade office manager John Williamson (Spacey) to give him some of the Glengarry leads, but Williamson refuses. Levene tries first to charm Williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. Levene cannot come up with the cash and leaves without better leads.

Meanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) complain about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that they strike back at the two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an [[accessory before the fact]] simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.

At a nearby bar, [[Richard Roma|Ricky Roma]] (Pacino), the office's top "closer", delivers a long, disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk (Pryce). Roma does not broach the subject of a Glengarry Farms real estate deal until he has completely won Lingk over with his speech. Framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays upon Lingk's feelings of insecurity.

The next day, when the salesmen come into the office, they learn that there has been a burglary and the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private. After his interrogation, Moss leaves in disgust, only after having one last shouting match with Roma. During the cycle of interrogations, Lingk arrives to tell Roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal. Scrambling to salvage the deal, Roma tries to deceive Lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed, and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider.

Levene abets Roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport. Williamson, unaware of Roma and Levene's stalling tactic, lies to Lingk, claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank. Upset, Lingk rushes out of the office, and Roma berates Williamson for what he has done. Roma then enters Williamson's office to take his turn at being interrogated by the police.

Levene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal to get back at Williamson, Levene accidentally reveals that he knows Williamson lied to Roma minutes earlier about depositing Lingk's check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night — something only a man who broke into the office would know. Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, "Because I don't like you."

Levene makes a last-ditch attempt at gaining sympathy from Williamson by mentioning his daughter's health, but Williamson cruelly rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective about Levene's part in the burglary. Williamson walks out of the room as Roma enters. Unaware, Roma talks to Levene about their forming a business partnership. The detective calls for Levene, who walks into Williamson's office. Roma leaves the office to go for lunch. Aaronow returns to his desk to make his sales calls.

==Production==
David Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the [[Royal National Theatre]], London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That same year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.&lt;ref name= "Weinraub, Bernard"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | coauthors = | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.

Mamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian movie theater chain, several banks, and [[New Line Cinema]] over the course of four years.&lt;ref name= "Weinraub, Bernard"/&gt;

[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked [[Jack Lemmon]] to act in the film.&lt;ref name= "Blanchard, Jayne"&gt;{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 27, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. [[Alec Baldwin]], who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he "wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted".&lt;ref name= "Hartl, John"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | coauthors = | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.&lt;ref name= "production notes"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.

By March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky  remembers, "Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'."&lt;ref name= "Weinraub, Bernard"/&gt; The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, "Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''".&lt;ref name= "production notes"/&gt; Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients – [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] – soon joined the cast.

Because of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.&lt;ref name= "Weinraub, Bernard"/&gt; This did not stop other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],&lt;ref name= "Weinraub, Bernard"/&gt; [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],&lt;ref name= "Blanchard, Jayne"/&gt; from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.

Once the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the Kaufman Astoria Soundstage in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembers, "There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going".&lt;ref name= "production notes"/&gt; Alan Arkin said of the script, "What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb".&lt;ref name= "production notes"/&gt; During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.&lt;ref name= "Berardinelli, James"&gt;{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anchía]], relied on low lighting and shadows with a blues, greens, and reds color scheme for the first part of the film. For the second half, he adhered to a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.

During the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film. Tokofsky sued to strip Zupnik of his producer's credit and share of the producer's fee.&lt;ref name= "Powers, William"&gt;{{cite news | last = Powers | first = William F | coauthors = | title = Pacino, Mamet and . . . Zupnik; Who? The Local Real Estate Mogul Behind ''Glengarry'' | work = [[The Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 4, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zupnik claimed that he personally put up $2 million of the film's budget and countersued, claiming that Tokofsky was fired for embezzlement.&lt;ref name= "Powers, William"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Glengarry Glen Ross'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]], where Jack Lemmon won the [[Venice Film Festival#Volpi Cup best actor|Volpi Cup for Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Jennifer | coauthors = | title = Three U.S. entries sign on at 49th Venice Fest | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = July 31, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was originally slated to be shown at the [[Montreal Film Festival]], but it was necessary to show it out of competition because it was entered into competition at the Venice Film Festival at the same time. Instead, it was given its North American premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adilman | first = Sid | coauthors = | title = Festivals scrap over movie | work = [[Toronto Star]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 1, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened in [[wide release]] on October 2, 1992 in 416 theaters, grossing $2.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $10.7 million in [[North America]],&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; just below its $12.5 million budget.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=glengarryglenross.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a rating of 94% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with a consensus of, "This adaptation of David Mamet's play is every bit as compelling and witty as its source material, thanks in large part to a clever script and a bevy of powerhouse actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glengarry Glen Ross|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/glengarry_glen_ross/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 80 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name=MC&gt;[[Artisan Entertainment]] quoted at [[Metacritic]], "[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/glengarry-glen-ross Glengarry Glen Ross]". Accessed April 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film an "A" rating in his review for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, praising Lemmon's performance as "a revelation" and describing his character as "the weaselly soul of ''Glengarry Glen Ross''–[[Willy Loman]] turned into a one-liner".&lt;ref name="Gleiberman, Owen"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | coauthors = | title = Pros and Cons | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 9, 1992 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312081,00.html | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "Mamet's dialogue has a kind of logic, a cadence, that allows people to arrive in triumph at the ends of sentences we could not possibly have imagined. There is great energy in it. You can see the joy with which these actors get their teeth into these great lines, after living through movies in which flat dialogue serves only to advance the story".&lt;ref name="Ebert, Roger"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 2, 1992 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921002/REVIEWS/210020302/1023 | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's Jack Kroll observed of Alec Baldwin's performance, "Baldwin is sleekly sinister in the role of Blake, a troubleshooter called in to shake up the salesmen. He shakes them up, all right, but this character (not in the original play) also shakes up the movie's toned balance with his sheer noise and scatological fury".&lt;ref name="Kroll"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kroll | first = Jack | coauthors = | title = Heels, Heroes and Hustlers | work = [[Newsweek]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 5, 1992 | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/147209/page/2 | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] praised, "the utterly demonic skill with which these foulmouthed characters carve one another up in futile attempts to stave off disaster. It's also because of the breathtaking wizardry with which Mr. Mamet and Mr. Foley have made a vivid, living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work".&lt;ref name="Canby, Vincent"&gt;{{cite news | last = Canby | first = Vincent | coauthors = | title = Mamet's Real Estate Sharks and Their Prey | authorlink=Vincent Canby|work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 30, 1992 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7D9113DF933A0575AC0A964958260 | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Richard Corliss wrote, "A peerless ensemble of actors fills ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' with audible glares and shudders. The play was zippy black comedy about predators in twilight; the film is a photo-essay, shot in morgue closeup, about the difficulty most people have convincing themselves that what they do matters".&lt;ref name="Corliss, Richard"&gt;{{cite news | last = Corliss | first = Richard | coauthors = | title = Sweating Out Loud | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976707,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Desson Howe's review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized Foley's direction, writing that it "doesn't add much more than the street between. If his intention is to create a sense of claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie".&lt;ref name="Howe, Desson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Howe | first = Desson | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 2, 1992 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/glengarryglenrossrhowe_a0af12.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Bona fide|other uses|Bona fide (disambiguation)|and|Good faith (disambiguation)}}
'''Good faith''' ({{lang-la|bona fides}}), in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with ''bona fides''; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of ''good faith''.&lt;ref&gt;Garger, John. "Translating Arguendo and Bona Fide from Latin to English." ''Bright Hub Education''. Bright Hub Inc., 5 Jan 2012. Retrieved 6 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept within [[law]] and [[business]]. The opposed concepts are [[bad faith]], ''mala fides'' (duplicity) and [[perfidy]] (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of ''bona fides'' is synonymous with [[credential]]s and [[identity document|identity]]. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.

==''Bona fides''==
''Bona fides'' is a Latin phrase meaning "good faith". Its [[Ablative (Latin)|ablative case]] is ''bona fide'', meaning "in good faith", it is often used as an adjective to mean "genuine". While today ''fides'' is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like "reliability", in the sense of a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In [[ancient Rome]] ''bona fides'' was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=John P.|title=THE ROMAN CONCEPT OF FIDES|website= sun.edu|date= May 2009|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/fides.html|accessdate= &lt;!-- January 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fides (deity)|Fides]] was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious "divinity" in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]].

==Law==
{{main article|Good faith (law)}}
In [[law]], ''bona fides'' denotes the [[:wikt:mental state|mental]] and [[morality|moral]] states of honesty and [[belief|conviction]] regarding either the [[truth]] or the [[falsity]] of a [[proposition]], or of a body of [[opinion]]; likewise regarding either the rectitude or the depravity of a line of [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]]. As a legal concept ''bona fides'' is especially important in matters of [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=819&amp;bold=|title=good faith |publisher=Law.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Faith as an international principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/901000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''bona fide'' is also proclaimed by the original version of the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magna Carta]] (1215), Clause I&lt;/ref&gt; In contract law, the implied covenant of good faith is a general presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly and fairly, so as not to destroy the right of the other party or parties to receive the benefits of the contract. In insurance law, the insurer's breach of the implied covenant may give rise to a legal liability known as [[insurance bad faith]].

Most US jurisdictions view breaches of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing solely as a variant of breach of [[contract]]. Linguistically, in the US, American English usage of ''bona fides'' applies it as synonymous with [[credential]]s, professional background, and documents attesting a person's [[identity document|identity]], which is not synonymous with [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]]. More recently, other common law countries have begun to adopt good faith as a general principle. In the UK, the High Court in ''[[Yam Seng Pte Ltd v Int Trade Corp Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWHC 111&lt;/ref&gt; expressed this preference. In Canada, the Supreme Court declared in ''[[Bhasin v. Hrynew]]'' that good faith was a general organizing principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do |title=SCC 71|year=2014|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment efforts==
[[Bona fide occupational qualifications|''Bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] (employer's good faith effort) are qualities or attributes that employers are allowed to consider when making decisions on the hiring and retaining of employees. An employer's good faith effort is used as an evaluation tool by the jurisdiction during the annual program review process to determine an employer's level of commitment to the reduction goals of the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|CTR Law]]. [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state government]]s are required by [[Affirmative action#United States|affirmative action]] (and other such laws) to look for disabled, minority, female, and veteran business enterprises when bidding public jobs. Good faith effort law varies from state to state and even within states depending on the awarding department of the government. Most good faith effort requires advertising in state certified publications, usually a trade and a focus publication. Other countries such as Canada have similar programs.

==In wikis==
Public [[wiki]]s depend on implicitly or explicitly assuming that its users are acting in good faith. [[Wikipedia]]'s principle ''Assume Good Faith'' (often abbreviated AGF) has been a stated guideline since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Wikipedia:Assume good faith." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 13 May 2005, 20:361 UTC. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;oldid=14428829 Wikipedia:Assume good faith]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "the first principle in the Wikipedia etiquette".&lt;ref&gt;Goldspink, Chris (2007), "[http://isce.edu/ISCE_Group_Site/web-content/ISCE_Events/Auckland_2007/Papers/Regular/032_Goldspink.pdf Normative self-regulation in the emergence of global network institutions: The Case of Wikipedia]", ''Proceedings of the 13th ANZSYS Conference'' - Auckland, New Zealand, 2-5 December 2007; Systemic Development: Local Solutions in a Global Environment&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study of users' motives for contributing to Wikipedia, "while participants have both individualistic and collaborative motives, collaborative ([[Altruism|altruistic]]) motives dominate."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C., Prasarnphanich, P.

'''Henry Bell''' (7 April 1767 – 14 March 1830) was a Scottish engineer known for introducing the first successful passenger [[steamboat]] service in Europe.

==Early career==
Bell was born at [[Torphichen]], near [[Bathgate]], West Lothian in 1767 and pioneered the development of the [[steamship]]. He was the fifth son of Patrick Bell and Margaret Easton, themselves members of a family well known at the time as [[millwright]]s, builders and engineers. Their work included the design and construction of [[harbours]], bridges, etc., in [[Scotland]] and throughout the United Kingdom. Henry Bell was educated at the local parish school and was apprenticed to a [[stonemason]] in 1780. Three years later, he was apprenticed to his uncle, a [[millwright]]. He later learned [[Ship model basin|ship modelling]] in [[Borrowstounness]] and in 1787, pursued his interest in ship mechanics in Bell's Hill with the engineer Mr James Inglis. This was followed by several years in London.

He returned to Scotland around 1790, and moved to [[Glasgow]], where he worked as a house-[[carpenter]]. His ambition was to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors and become a civil engineer, and to this end he joined the Glasgow corporation of wrights on 20 October 1797. He was unsuccessful, apparently due to either lack of money, or lack of application or skill on his part. According to one contemporary: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Bell had many of the features of the enthusiastic projector; never calculated means to ends, or looked much farther than the first stages or movements of any scheme. His mind was a chaos of extraordinary projects, the most of which, from his want of accurate scientific calculation, he never could carry into practice. Owing to an imperfection in even his mechanical skill, he scarcely ever made one part of a model suit the rest, so that many designs, after a great deal of pains and expense, were successively abandoned. He was, in short, the hero of a thousand blunders and one success."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interest in steam power for shipping==
The idea of propelling vessels by means of steam early took possession of his mind. "In 1800 (he writes) I applied to [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Lord Melville]], on purpose to show his lordship and the other members of the Admiralty, the practicability and great utility of applying steam to the propelling of vessels against winds and tides, and every obstruction on rivers and seas, where there was depth of water." Disappointed in this application, he repeated the attempt in 1803, with the same result, notwithstanding the emphatic declaration of the celebrated [[Lord Nelson]], who, addressing their lord-ships on the occasion, said, "My Lords, if you do not adopt Mr Bell's scheme, other nations will, and in the end vex every vein of this empire. It will succeed (he added), and you should encourage Mr Bell." Having obtained no support in this country, Bell forwarded copies of the prospectus of his scheme to the different nations of Europe, and to the United States of America. "The Americans," he writes, "were the first who put my plan into practice, and were quickly followed by other nations." The various attempts which preceded that of Bell are briefly noticed in the "Fifth Report of the [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[Steamboat|Steam-Boats]], June, 1822, Sir Henry Parnell, chairman." Mentioning the following as experimenters, namely, Mr [[Jonathan Hulls]], in 1736; the Duke of Bridgewater, on the Manchester and Runcorn canal; Mr Miller of Dalswinton; the Marquis de Jouffroy (a French nobleman), in 1781; [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]], in 1795; and Mr Symington and Mr Taylor, on the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]], in 1801-2; the Report proceeds—"These ingenious men made valuable experiments, and tested well the mighty power of steam. Still no practical uses resulted from any of these attempts. It was not till the year 1807, when the Americans began to use steamboats on their rivers, that their safety and utility were first proved. But the merit of constructing these boats is due to natives of Great Britain. Mr Henry Bell of Glasgow gave the first model of them to the late Mr Fulton of America, and corresponded regularly with Fulton on the subject. Mr Bell continued to turn his talents to the improving of steam apparatus, and its application to various manufactures about Glasgow; and in 1811, constructed the ''Comet'' [[Steamboat|steam-boat]]."

==Paddlesteamer ''Comet''==
In 1808, Bell moved to the modern town of [[Helensburgh]], on the north shore of the [[Firth of Clyde]], where his wife undertook the superintendence of the public baths, and at the same time kept the principal inn, whilst he continued to prosecute his favourite scheme, without much regard to the ordinary affairs of the world.

[[File:Image taken from page 130 of 'My first voyage. A book for youth. Illustrated by E. Roffe' (11030906584).jpg|thumb|The ''Comet'']]
In 1812 he and John Robertson built the [[Steamboat|steam-boat]] the ''[[PS Comet]]'', of 30 tons burthen, with an engine of three horsepower. The Comet, named after a great comet which had been visible for several months in 1811–12, was built by Messrs John Wood and Co., at [[Port Glasgow]] which lies 3 miles to the east of [[Greenock]], as adjacent towns on the south bank of the [[River Clyde]] as it widens into the Firth of Clyde.  The ''Comet'' made a delivery voyage from Port Glasgow 21 miles upriver to the Broomielaw, Glasgow, then sailed from Glasgow the 24 miles down to Greenock, making five miles an hour against a head-wind.{{sfn|Wood|1885}} ''(some sources give a date of 18 January 1812 for a trial trip, McCrorie gives 6 August 1812 for the delivery, with the historic trip a day or so later.)'' In August Bell advertised a passenger service on the ''Comet'' between Glasgow, Greenock and Helensburgh three times a week, returning on alternate days,  "to ply upon the River Clyde from Glasgow, to sail by the power of air, wind, and steam."

Bell briefly tried a service on the [[Firth of Forth]]. Then he had the ''Comet'' lengthened and re-engined and from September 1819 ran a service to [[Oban]] and [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] (via the [[Crinan Canal]]) a trip which took four days, but on 13 December 1820 the Comet was shipwrecked in strong currents at Craignish Point, near Oban. Bell built another vessel,
''Comet II'', but, on 21 October 1825 she collided with the steamer ''Ayr'' off Kempock Point, [[Gourock]]. ''Comet II'' sank very quickly, killing 62 of the 80 passengers on board. After the loss of his second ship, Bell abandoned his work on steam navigation.

==Later life==
Bell lived to see his invention universally adopted. The Clyde, which first enjoyed the advantages of steam navigation, became the principal seat of this description of [[ship-building]]. Bell reaped no personal advantage from the widespread adoption of steam powered ships, and spent many of his later years in abject poverty.
[[File:Grave of Henry Bell in Rhu churchyard - geograph.org.uk - 86712.jpg|thumb|Grave of Henry Bell in Rhu churchyard]]
Touched by his condition, the late Dr Cleland, and a number of other benevolent individuals, commenced a subscription on his behalf, by which a considerable sum was raised. The trustees on the river Clyde granted him an annuity of £100, which was continued to his widow.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
This was but a becoming acknowledgment of the value of his great invention on the part of the trustees of a river whose annual revenue was greatly increased by it.

==Death==
Bell died at [[Helensburgh]] in 1830, aged 62. 
He was interred in the [[Rhu, Argyll and Bute|Rhu]] churchyard. 
An obelisk to his memory was erected on the rock of Dunglass, a promontory on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]], about 2½ miles above [[Dumbarton]]. There is a memorial stone and obelisk on the seafront at Helensburgh.

{{Companies law}}
'''Incorporation (Inc.)''' is the formation of a new corporation (a corporation being a legal entity that is effectively [[corporate personhood|recognized as a person under the law]]). The corporation may be a [[business]], a [[nonprofit organization]], [[sports club]], or a [[government]] of a new [[city]] or [[town]]. This article focuses on the process of incorporation; see also [[corporation|Corporation]] (Corp.).

==USA==

===Certificate of Inc. (requirements)===
The information required differ in different states. However, there are some common information that are asked by almost all the states and so, must be incl. in the Certificate of Inc., accordingly. They are as follows:
*'''Business purpose''' – It would describe the incorporated tasks a Company (Co.) has to do or provide. At present, only two types of business purpose clauses are used. They are:

# General – General purpose clauses are accepted by some and not all states. It indicates that the budding company has been formed to carry out "all lawful business" in the region.
# Specific – Alternatively, some states have made it mandatory for the business owners to furnish a more detailed explanation of the products and/or services to be offered by their Co..

*'''Corp. name''' – A chosen name must be added to the Certificate of Inc.. This should be followed with the corporate identifier such as "Corp.", "Inc.", "Co.". A preliminary name availability search is advisable, prior to the submission of the Articles of Inc.. In case of online incorporation, the state will have final say with regards to the name chosen for the company and that the name shouldn't deceive or mislead the consumers.
*'''Regd. agent''' – Almost all the states require every corporation to have a registered agent of their own in the state of incorporation. Registered (Regd.) agents will receive all the important legal as well as tax documents on behalf of the corporation. A typical regd. agent will need a physical address (PO box nos.) in the state of incorporation and should be accessible during normal business hours.
*'''Inc.''' – An Inc. is the person who prepares and files the Certificate of Inc. with the concerned state.
*'''Share par value''' – It refers to the stated minimum value, and generally doesn't correspond to the actual value. Usually, $00.01, $01.00 or no par are some of the common par values. In reality, the value of a share is based on its fair market value, or whatever amount a buyer is willing to pay for the same.
*'''Nr. of authorized shares of stock''' – An Inc. needs to stipulate the exact number of shares they as a company are willing to authorize. Moreover, it is mandatory for every Corp., be it small or large, to have stock. A stock represents ownership in the corporation.
*'''Directors''' – Many states need the name and addresses of the initial directors of the corporation in the incorporation papers. They are responsible for the corporation's daily affairs and oversee major corporate decisions. Directors hold an [[elected office]] as chosen by the shareholders' mandate and will be responsible to appoint officers.
*'''Preferred shares''' – If a Co./Corp. is willing to permit both [[preferred stock|preferred]] as well as [[common stock|common shares]] of stock, then this should have a mention in the Articles of Incorporation, along with the voting rights information. Generally, preferred shares provide its shareholders preferential payments of distribution of assets or dividends, in case the company shuts down its operations. A lot of small business owners only allow shares of common stock. 
*'''Officers''' – Officers include president, vice president, secretary and treasurer have the responsibility towards the daily activities of the Corp.. Certain states require that officer information be included, while others have kept it optional.
*'''Legal address of the Co./Corp.''' – In many states, it is optional to provide the legal or principal business address. But in some states it is mandatory.

===Legal benefits===
*'''Protection of personal assets''' – One of the most important legal benefits is the safeguarding of personal assets against the claims of creditors and lawsuits. Sole proprietors and general partners in a [[partnership]] are personally and jointly responsible for all the [[legal liability|Legal Liability]] (LL) of a business such as loans, accounts payable, and legal judgments. In a corporation, however, [[stockholders]], [[board of directors|directors]] and [[Chief executive officer|officers]] typically are not liable for the company's debts and obligations. They are limited in liability to the amount they have invested in the corporation. For example, if a shareholder purchased $100 in stock, no more than $100.00 can be lost. Corporation (Corp.) and [[limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) may hold assets such as real estate, cars or boats. If a shareholder of a corporation is personally involved in a lawsuit or [[bankruptcy]], these assets may be protected. A creditor of a shareholder of a Corp. or LLC cannot seize the assets of the company. However, the creditor can seize ownership shares in the corporation, as they are considered a personal asset.
*'''Transferable ownership''' – Ownership in a Corp. or LLC is easily transferable to others, either in whole or in part. Some state laws are particularly corporate-friendly. For example, the transfer of ownership in a corporation incorporated in [[Delaware corporation|US-DE]] is not required to be filed or recorded. 
*'''Retirement funds''' – Retirement funds and qualified retirements plans, such as a [[401(k)]], may be established more easily.
*'''Taxation''' – In USA, Corp. are [[tax]]ed at a lower rate than individuals are. Also, they can own shares in other corporations and receive corporate dividends 80% tax-free. There are no limits on the amount of losses a corporation may carry forward to subsequent tax years. A sole proprietorship, on the other hand, cannot claim a capital loss greater than $3,000.00 unless the owner has offsetting capital gains.
*'''Raising funds through sale of stock'''. A Corp. can easily raise capital from investors through the sale of stock.
*'''Durability''' – A corporation is capable of continuing indefinitely. Its existence is not affected by the death of shareholders, directors, or officers of the corporation.
*'''Credit rating''' – Regardless of an owner's personal [[credit score]]s, a corporation can acquire its own [[credit rating]], and build a separate credit history by applying for and using corporate credit.

===Legal history===
Am. opinion of corporations has evolved significantly throughout history, and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases provide a means to observe this evolution. While these cases may seem arbitrary and decontextualized when examined individually, when viewed successively and within historical context, a narrative emerges that offers an explanation for why such views are upheld.

====''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819====
1816 the [[New Hampshire]] state legislature passed a bill that would turn privately owned [[Dartmouth College]] into a publicly owned university with a Board of Trustees appointed by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819&lt;/ref&gt; The board filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislature. The suit alleged the college enjoyed the right to contract and the government changing that contract was not allowed. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the majority opinion and affirmed that the right to contract exists between owners of private property rather than between a government and its citizens. The case was the first case in US history that asked fundamental questions about corporate entities and the protections they enjoy; it also was a precedent-setting case in extending "individual rights" to corporations.

====''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886====
The railroad was an expensive multi-year project that greatly changed and altered both the physical and commercial landscape of the country. As with most new technology developments that have a broad impact, there are disputes about how those technologies and the businesses they thrive in fit under the umbrella of laws that govern regulations and taxation. In 1886 one such taxation dispute arose between [[Santa Clara County]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad thought the tax code was misapplied to some of their property and assets. In deciding the case, a unanimous court ruled that governments must abide by the same tax code enforcement for individuals that it did for corporations. While not explicitly stated in the case, it was implied that this case extended equal protection rights to corporations under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]].

====''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933====
The booming economy the railroad corporations helped build from the late 19th into the early 20th centuries came to a screeching halt in 1929. [[The Great Depression]], as it came to be known, helped a view of corporations emerge that put them at odds with the normal working man. The election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was a manifestation of many populist sentiments the country might have felt. In 1933 a [[Florida]] case came before the court, again disputing taxation.&lt;ref&gt;''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee|''Liggett v. Lee'']] the court ruled that there could be a corporate tax, essentially saying the structure of business was a justifiably discriminatory criterion for governments to consider when writing tax legislation. This was a unique ruling handed down during a unique time in US history that denied a corporation freedom it sought in the courtroom.

====''First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti'', 1978====
From 1940 to 1990 the percent of total [[GDP]] made up by financial service professionals increased by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;Cracks in the Pipeline Part One: Restoring Efficiency to Wall Street and Value to Main Street&lt;/ref&gt; Along with that growth there was a growth in the profits this industry experienced as well. As the disposable income of banks and other financial institutions rose, they sought a way to use it to influence politics and policy. In response, [[Massachusetts]] passed a law limiting corporate donations strictly to issues related to their industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Bank of Boston v. Belloti'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First National Bank of Boston]] challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and won. ''[[First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti]]'' allowed business to use financial speech in political causes of any nature.

====''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010====
In 2010 amidst an outpouring of frustration and blame directed at [[Wall Street]] the issue of corporate contributions came before the court again.&lt;ref&gt;''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' the court said there was virtually no distinction between monetary contributions and political speech, and because we do not limit political speech unless it is tantamount to bribery, corporations have the right as people to donate unlimited amounts of money to any political cause so long as it is not to a direct campaign.

===Steps required for incorporation===
The '''[[articles of incorporation]]''' (also called a [[charter]], [[certificate of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]]) are filed with the appropriate state office, listing the purpose of the corporation, its principal place of business and the number and type of shares of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211035539/https://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments|title=State Corporation Departments: Interactive Map :: LawServer|archivedate=2013-02-11|date=2013-02-11|access-date=2017-11-01||work=LawServer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A registration fee is due, which is usually between $25 and $1,000, depending on the state.

A corporate name is generally made up of three parts: "distinctive element", "descriptive element", and a legal ending. All corporations must have a distinctive element, and in most filing jurisdictions, a legal ending to their names. Some corporations choose not to have a descriptive element. In the name "Tiger Computers, Inc.", the word "Tiger" is the distinctive element; the word "Computers" is the descriptive element; and the "Inc." is the legal ending. The legal ending indicates that it is in fact a [[legal corporation]] and not just a [[business License|business registration]] or [[partnership]]. Incorporated, [[limited company|limited]], and corporation, or their respective abbreviations (Inc., Ltd., Corp.) are the possible legal endings in the US.

Usually, there are also '''[[bylaw|corporate bylaws]]''' which must be filed with the state. Bylaws outline a number of important administrative details such as when annual shareholder meetings will be held, who can vote and the manner in which shareholders will be notified if there is need for an additional "special" meeting.

===Taxation===
{{Main article|Corporate tax in the United States}}
Corporations can only deduct net operating losses going back two years and forward 20 years.

===Reporting after incorporation===
Assuming a corporation has not sold [[stock]] to the public, conducting corporate business is straightforward. Often, it amounts to recording key corporate decisions (for example, borrowing money or buying real estate) and holding an annual meeting. These formalities can often be supplanted by written agreement and do not usually need a face-to-face meeting.

==In the United Kingdom==
{{Main article|Company formation}}
In the UK, the process of incorporation is generally called company formation. The United Kingdom is one of the quickest locations to incorporate, with a fully electronic process and a very fast turnaround by the national registrar of companies, the [[Companies House]]. The current [[Companies House]] record is five minutes to vet and issue a [[certificate of incorporation]] for an electronic application.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Types of companies===
There are many different types of UK companies:

* [[Public limited company]] (PLC)
* [[Private company limited by shares]] (Ltd.)
* [[Company limited by guarantee]]
* [[Unlimited company]] (Unltd.)
* [[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
* [[Community interest company]]
* [[Industrial and provident society]] (IPS)
* [[Royal charter]] (RC)

==International perspective==
{{See also|Types of business entity}}
The legal concept of incorporation is recognized all over the world.

* In the United States, there are many ways that a corporation can be identified. The four forms that are valid in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are "Corporation", "Incorporated", and the abbreviations "Corp." and "Inc." Some states allow the use of "Company" and some have additional optional names. A complete list of which names are allowed in each state can be found at [[Types of business entity#United States]].
* In [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] ("Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung", meaning "limited liability business association"), as well as the [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] ("Aktiengesellschaft", meaning "business association with shares"), are the entities most similar to the corporations in the US.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], with the exception of an [[unlimited company]] or corporation which requires no designation as part of its legal company name, the titles [[Limited company|Ltd.]] (limited company) or [[Public limited company|plc]] (public limited company) are used for corporations.
* In [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the term "[[Sàrl|SARL]] ({{fr}}), (société à responsibilité limitée, company with limited liability)" or [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] (société anonyme, anonymous corporation) or [[Société par actions simplifiée|SAS]] (Société par actions simplifiée, simplified anonymous joint-stock corporation) is used.
* [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]] and [[Latin America]] use the title [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] (anonymous partnership) for stock corporations or Ltda (limitada or limited liability) for limited companies. (Ltda is denoted SL in Spain, for "Sociedad Limitada", and SRL in Argentina, for ("Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada")).
* In [[Poland]] there is the title [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] (standing for Spółka Akcyjna, Polish for stock partnership) for stock corporations or Sp. z o.o. (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, a partnership with limited liability) for limited companies. There is also Spółka komandytowa (Sp. K.), a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one has limited liability, and Spółka komandytowo-akcyjna (Sp. K. A.){{snd}} a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one is a stock shareholder not being liable.
* [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] use the title A/S for stock corporations ({{lang-da|Aktieselskab}}, {{lang-no|Aksjeselskap}}), while Sweden uses the similar AB ({{lang-sv|aktiebolag}}). [[Finland]] uses Oy ({{lang-fi|Osakeyhtiö}}), Oyj for stock corporations (Osakeyhtiö, julkinen) and Ay (Avoin yhtiö) or Ky (Kommandiittiyhtiö) for private enterprises.
* In [[India]], the term [[Pvt Ltd]] is used for a company that is private, an entity similar to an [[limited liability company|LLC]] in the United States. [[Limited company|Ltd]] is used for [[Publicly listed company|publicly listed companies]] (shares of a listed company are traded on the stock market) or a public [[corporation]], a similar entity to a corporation in the US.
* [[Italy]] uses "Srl" or "Società a Responsabilità Limitata" (limited liability company), and "SpA" or "Società Per Azioni" (stock corporation).
* In the [[Netherlands]], [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]] (''Naamloze Vennootschap'') and [[Besloten vennootschap|B.V.]] (''Besloten Vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid'') are used. In [[Belgium]], the abbreviations NV and Bvba are used for similar types of entity.
* [[Malaysia]] uses Sdn. Bhd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companies.com.my companies.com.my]/&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ms|Sendirian Berhad}}), meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.
* [[Indonesia]] uses P.T. ({{lang-id|Perseroan Terbatas}}), meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US. This legal title is stated in front of the corporation name. If the shares become publicly listed for trading in stock exchange, it is called Tbk. ({{lang-id|Terbuka}}), appended after the corporation name.
* [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] use s.r.o. ({{lang-sk|spoločnosť s ručením obmedzeným}}, {{lang-cz|společnost s ručením omezeným}} meaning “business with limited liability”) and a.s. ({{lang-sk|akciová spoločnosť}}, {{lang-cz|akciová společnost}} meaning “business with shares”).
* In [[Latvia]], the most commonly used title of a corporation is "S.I.A." ({{lang-lv|Sabiedrība ar Ierobežotu Atbildību}}) for "limited liability company", or "LLC", and "A/S" ({{lang-lv|Akciju Sabiedrība}}) for "joint stock company", or "JSC". The title "S.I.A." and "A/S" are put before the name of the corporation. [[Lithuania]] uses "UAB" ({{lang-lt|Uždaroji Akcinė Bendrovė}}) for "limited liability company" and "AB" ({{lang-lt|Akcinė Bendrovė}}) for "joint stock company", and, like in Latvia, they also appear before the corporation's name.
* [[Albania]] uses "Sh.p.k" ({{lang-sq|Shoqëri me Përgjegjësi të Kufizuar}}) for "limited liability company", "Sh.a." ({{lang-sq|Shoqëri Anonime}}), meaning "anonymous partnership", for stock corporations. Pursuant to the Albanian legislation, the possible business structures are:
: Sole proprietorship (person fizik) – A business owned and managed by one individual who is personally liable for all business debts and obligations.
: Limited liability company (LLC) – A hybrid legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.
: Corporation – A legal entity owned by shareholders.
: Non-profit – An organization engaged in activities of public or private interest where making a profit is not a primary mission. Some non-profits are exempt from federal taxes.
* [[Singapore]] uses Pte. Ltd., meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/private-limited-company.html/ |title=Details on Private Limited Company |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[China]] uses WFOE (or WOFE), to refer to a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE). This is the most popular form of business entity for foreign investors wanting to set up a company in China; it is a limited liability company.
* In [[Canada]], the process of incorporation can be done either at the federal or provincial level. Companies which incorporate with the federal government will generally need to register extra-provincially in the province that they elect to do business. Similarly, a provincial corporation may need to register extra-provincially if they are to have offices outside of their home province. Incorporations are effected quite quickly, depending upon the jurisdiction of registration, as several provinces and the federal government have started to allow for electronic filing. Incorporated Canadian companies can generally use either Limited, Incorporated or Corporation in their name, but this may vary from province to province.
* [[Dubai]] uses "LLC" to denote a limited liability company. Listed companies use "PJSC" to denote a public joint stock company.
* In [[Turkey]], Ltd. Şti. (which stands for ''Limited Şirketi'') is a common form to denote limited liability companies.

{{Contract law}}
'''Indemnity''' is a contractual obligation of one party (indemnifier) to compensate the loss occurred to the other party (indemnity holder) due to the act of the indemnitor or any other party. The duty to indemnify is usually, but not always, coextensive with the contractual duty to "'''hold harmless'''" or "save harmless".  In contrast, a '''guarantee''' is an obligation of one party assuring the other party that guarantor will perform the promise of the third party if it defaults.

Indemnities form the basis of many [[insurance]] contracts; for example, a car owner may purchase different kinds of insurance as an indemnity for various kinds of loss arising from operation of the car, such as damage to the car itself, or medical expenses following an accident. In an [[Agency (law)|agency]] context, a principal may be obligated to indemnify their agent for liabilities incurred while carrying out responsibilities under the relationship. While the events giving rise to an indemnity may be specified by contract, the actions that must be taken to compensate the injured party are largely unpredictable, and the maximum compensation is often expressly limited.

==English common law==

&lt;!--If anybody writes of a different commonwealth jurisdiction, please change this title to 'United Kingdom', thanks--&gt;

===Indemnity clauses===
{{See also|Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977}}
Under section 4 of the [[Statute of Frauds]] (1677), a "guarantee" (an undertaking of secondary liability; to answer for another's default) must be evidenced in writing. No such formal requirement exists in respect of indemnities (involving the assumption of primary liability; to pay irrespective of another's default) which are enforceable even if made orally. (Ref: Peel E: "Treitel, The Law of Contract")

Under current English law, indemnities must be clearly and precisely worded in the contract in order to be enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweigart|first1=Raymond|title=English Indemnity Law–Parsing the Promise: Words Are Important, But So Are Actions|url=http://www.pillsburylaw.com/publications/english-indemnity-lawparsing-the-promise-words-are-important-but-so-are-actions|publisher=Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1977,  the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977|Unfair Contract Terms Act]] s4 stated that a consumer cannot be made to unreasonably indemnify another for their [[breach of contract]] or [[negligence]], however this section was repealed by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015|Consumer Rights Act 2015 sch 4 para 6.]]

===Contract award===
In [[England and Wales]] an "indemnity" monetary award may form part of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] during an action of [[restitutio in integrum]]. The [[property]] and funds are exchanged, but indemnity may be granted for costs necessarily incurred to the innocent party pursuant to the [[contract]]. The leading case is ''[[Whittington v Seale-Hayne]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1900) 82 LT 49&lt;/ref&gt; in which a contaminated [[farm]] was sold. The [[contract]] made the buyers renovate the [[property|real estate]] and, the contamination incurred medical expenses for their manager, who had fallen ill. Once the [[contract]] was rescinded, the buyer could be indemnified for the cost of renovation as this was necessary to the [[contract]], but not the medical expenses as the [[contract]] did not require them to hire a manager. Were the sellers at [[fault (legal)|fault]], [[damages]] would clearly be available.

The distinction between indemnity and [[damages]] is subtle may be differentiated by considering the roots of the [[law of obligations]]: how can money be paid where the [[defendant]] is not at fault? The [[contract]] before [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] is voidable but not void, so, for a period of time, there is a legal [[contract]]. During that time, both parties have legal obligation. If the [[contract]] is to be voided ''ab initio'' the obligations performed must also be [[payment|compensated]]. Therefore, the costs of indemnity arise from the (transient and performed) obligations of the claimant rather than a [[breach of contract|breach of obligation]] by the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, M, ''Law of Contract'', ed11 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from guarantees===
An indemnity is distinct from a [[guarantee]], which is the promise of a third party to honor the obligation of a party to a contract should that party be unable or unwilling to do so (usually a guarantee is limited to an obligation to pay a debt). This distinction between indemnity and guarantee was discussed as early as the eighteenth century in ''Birkmya v Darnell''.&lt;ref&gt;(1704) 1 Salk 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, concerned with a guarantee of payment for goods rather than payment of rent, the presiding judge explained that a guarantee effectively says "Let him have the goods; if he does not pay you, I will."&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''Mountstephan v Lakeman'' (1871) LR 7 QB 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from warranties===

An indemnity is distinct from a [[warranty]] in that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Byrne|title=Warranties and indemnities: what's the difference?|url=http://www.inhouselawyer.co.uk/index.php/ireland/7833-warranties-and-indemnities-whats-the-difference|website=The In-House Lawyer|accessdate=26 February 2015|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
* Warranties require the beneficiary to mitigate their losses, while indemnities do not.
* Warranties do not cover problems known to the beneficiary at the time the warranty is given, while indemnities do.

{{Anchor|US Contracts}}

==US contracts==

Many private contracts and [[terms of service]] in the United States require one party (indemnitor, typically a customer) to pay (indemnify) the other side's costs for legal claims arising from the relationship. They are particularly common in online services.&lt;ref name="qmul1"&gt;{{Citation |last=Kamarinou |first=Dimitra |title=Privacy in the Clouds: An Empirical Study of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of 20 Cloud Service Providers |date=2015-08-18 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2646447 |last2=Millard |last3=Hon |first2=Christopher |first3=W. Kuan |publisher=Queen Mary University of London - Cloud Legal Project |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US government publishes [https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/ special Terms of Service], which it has negotiated with many companies, to exclude indemnification for official US government work. US law "is violated by any indemnification agreement that, without statutory authorization, imposes on the United States an open-ended, potentially unrestricted liability."&lt;ref name=ag&gt;The Anti-Deficiency Act Implications of Consent by Government Employees to Online Terms of Service Agreements Containing Open-Ended Indemnification Clauses (Opinion of the US Attorney General. 2012) [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4342057/the-anti-deficiency-act-implications-of-consent-by-government-employees-to/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Hercules, Inc. v. United States, 516 U.S. 417 (1996)[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118004/hercules-inc-v-united-states/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Attorney General says federal agencies "should renegotiate the terms of service to revise or eliminate the indemnification clause or cancel the [government]'s enrollments in social media applications when their operators insist on such a clause."&lt;ref name=ag /&gt;

===State variations===
Under US law, interpretation of indemnification clauses varies by state.&lt;ref name=bern&gt;Bernstein, Jedidiah M. Esq. (May 2017). http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/tips-for-a-startup-manufacturer-in-31651/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California indemnification clauses do not cover certain risks unless the risks are listed in the contract, while in ''New York'' a brief clause, "X shall defend and indemnify Y for all claims arising from the Product" does make X responsible for all claims against Y.&lt;ref name=bern /&gt; Indemnity can be extremely costly, since X's liability insurance typically does not cover claims against Y, but X still has to cover them.&lt;ref name="boatus" /&gt;

In 2017, the Utah Supreme Court said that "By statute, a contractual provision requiring a purchaser of a product to indemnify a manufacturer is 'void and unenforceable' in certain circumstances. UTAH CODE § 78B-6-707."&lt;ref&gt;Bylsma v. R.C.WilleyHumanTouch, 2017 UT 85 [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4448338/bylsma-v-rcwilleyhumantouch/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012-2014, a New Jersey woman had to pay a lawyer to get out of an indemnity payment for injury at a storage unit. When someone slipped on ice in 2012, while going to a unit, Public Storage sued in court to make the woman who rented the unit pay for the injury. She tried to ignore the case, so state court ruled she must pay. She then retained a lawyer and went to court. In 2014, the US District Court said this specific indemnity clause was unenforceable in New Jersey, because it covered Public Storage's own negligence without explicitly saying so, contrary to New Jersey law (other states differ).&lt;ref&gt;MARTINEZ-SANTIAGO v. PUBLIC STORAGE (1:14-cv-00302-JBS-AMD),
[https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.298992.24.0.pdf opinion] and
[https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4311531/martinez-santiago-v-public-storage/ docket]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 decision in New Jersey upheld a broad indemnity clause, since it was followed by another sentence, "indemnity agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State of New Jersey". The judge said, "It is true that a consumer, unfamiliar with the laws of New Jersey, would not be able to state with certainty how far the waiver extends".&lt;ref&gt;SAURO v. L.A. FITNESS INTERNATIONAL, LLC (1:12-cv-03682), [https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.275723.30.0.pdf opinion] and [https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4310733/sauro-v-la-fitness-international-llc/ docket]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Colorado Supreme Court required a flower shop to indemnify its shopping center for a customer who slipped on the icy parking lot, through no fault of the flower shop, because the tenant was there to visit that shop, and the shop's lease had a broad indemnity clause.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com/article/three-strategies-limiting-your-indemnity-obligation | title=Three Strategies for Limiting Your Indemnity Obligation | author=Cohen, Alan M. Esq. | journal=Commercial Tenants Lease Insider |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a Federal District Court in Wyoming did not require a customer to indemnify a white-water rafting company for injury to his wife, since the wording may have only applied to him and his children, and clauses cannot be enforced in Wyoming to indemnify a company for its own negligence.&lt;ref name="wyo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/1999135231fsupp2d132111193 |title=MADSEN v.

In 1979 the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a subcontractor must indemnify the builder for damages it caused, according to an indemnification clause in their purchase order.&lt;ref&gt;Turner v.

In 1966 the California Supreme Court ruled that Hertz could not enforce its clause requiring renters to indemnify Hertz' insurer.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Nat. Ins. Co. v.

===With negotiations===
When a contract is '''negotiable''', the indemnitor negotiates to control these legal costs. It will not let the indemnified party (indemnitee) overspend, ''"An arrangement where the indemnitee makes decisions about how to defend and settle the claim while the indemnitor writes the checks presents a [[moral hazard]]. Knowing that its defense and settlement costs are being borne by the indemnitor, the indemnitee may be encouraged to engage a more expensive legal team or pursue a riskier defense strategy than it would otherwise. For this reason, most indemnitors are unwilling to indemnify against claims when they do not control the defense of the claim."''&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202747710279/Indemnity-Procedures-and-Liability-in-IT-Contracts?mcode=0&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL | title=Indemnity Procedures and Liability in IT Contracts |author1=Steinberg, Jim  |author2=Lance McCord | journal=Daily Report | date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Bar Association has published advice on negotiations of construction contracts: that (1) owners try to get contractors to indemnify as much as possible, while (2) contractors (a) only indemnify for their own negligence and (b) "establish a right but not a duty for the contractor to defend under an indemnification claim."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tklaw.com/files/Publication/632aa92a-f020-4001-bbc8-d5a1d3e83c60/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/5c85c61b-0b85-4777-93ff-d95505b1d707/ABA_PP_v028n05__critical_construction_contract_clauses.pdf Critical Construction Contract Clauses], published by ABA in ''Probate and Property'', 2014, Volume 28, Number 5&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of letting the indemnitor control costs is (in this case a contractor for a homeowners association-HOA), "''Contractor shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Association) and hold harmless the Association"''&lt;ref name="stirling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.davis-stirling.com/MainIndex/HoldHarmlessIndemnify/tabid/539/Default.aspx | title=HOLD HARMLESS &amp; INDEMNIFY | publisher=Adams-Stirling Professional Law Corp | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and HOAs also use indemnity to protect directors, since few would serve as directors if their risks were not indemnified.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.communityassociationmanagement.com/c49-legal-compliance/c57-ask-the-experts/association-answers-are-hoa-board-members-protected-from-lawsuits/ | title=Association Answers | publisher=Community Association Management, reprinted from Charlotte Observer | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiation is important for both parties, '' "Just about all homeowner association management contracts have a provision which states that the HOA shall indemnify the manager under certain circumstances... There are several ways the indemnification clause can be drafted and both management and HOA must take into account what protects each the best"''&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://realtytimes.com/consumeradvice/hoaadvice1/item/7280-20070321_indemnifymanag | title=Indemnify the HOA Manager | author=Thompson, Richard | journal=Realty Times | date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If indemnitors can negotiate a limit on liability in their contract, this limits the cost of a potential indemnity if they "''make clear in the agreement that any limitations of liability (whether in the form of caps or exclusions of certain types of damages—e.g., consequential) apply to the ... indemnification''."&lt;ref name="corpcounsel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202759907099/Some-IP-Indemnification-Considerations-for-Tech-Vendors | title=Some IP Indemnification Considerations for Tech Vendors | author=Michael Bloom, Lindsey Chandler and Alexa Peterson | journal=Corporate Counsel | date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Without negotiations===
When a contract is '''not''' negotiable ([[adhesion contract]]), the wording often lets the indemnitee decide what to spend on legal costs and bill the indemnitor. Most clauses are quite broad.&lt;ref name="qmul2"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Bradshaw |first=Simon |last2=Millard |first2=Christopher |last3=Walden |first3=Ian |date=2010-09-02 |title=Contracts for Clouds: Comparison and Analysis of the Terms and Conditions of Cloud Computing Services |publisher=Queen Mary University of London - Cloud Legal Project  |url=http://www.cloudlegal.ccls.qmul.ac.uk/Research/researchpapers/37188.html |location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of indemnity requirements from a range of businesses.

==Insurance==

{{See also|Prize indemnity insurance}}&lt;!--a lot of people made vague references to insurance, Please place these here if they are directly relevant to indemnity--&gt;
Indemnity insurance compensates the beneficiaries of the policies for their actual economic losses, up to the limiting amount of the insurance policy. It generally requires the insured to prove the amount of its loss before it can recover. Recovery is limited to the amount of the provable loss even if the face amount of the policy is higher. This is in contrast to, for example, life insurance, where the amount of the beneficiary's economic loss is irrelevant.  The death of the person whose life is insured for reasons not excluded from the policy obligate the insurer to pay the entire policy amount to the beneficiary.

Most business interruption insurance policies contain an Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement, which extends coverage beyond the time that it takes to physically restore the property. This provision covers additional expenses that allow the business to return to prosperity and help the business restore revenues to pre-loss levels.&lt;ref&gt;Adjusting Today [http://adjustersinternational.com/adjustingtoday/?start=3&amp;page_no=3&amp;pdfID=37 The Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Freeing of slaves and indentured servants===
[[Slave owners]] suffered a loss whenever their [[slave]]s  were granted their freedom. Slave owners might have been paid to cover their losses.

When the slaves of [[Zanzibar]] were freed in 1897, it was by compensation since the prevailing opinion was that the slave owners suffered the loss of an asset whenever a slave was freed.

In the 1860s in the [[United States]], U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] had requested many millions of dollars from Congress with which to compensate slave owners for the loss of their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=Abraham Lincoln's Second Annual Message of 1862 |first=Abraham |last=Lincoln |authorlink=Abraham Lincoln |event=Presidential speech |date=December 1, 1862 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29503#axzz1pzerHqlo |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66OKu6j1R?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29503 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1868, [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Validity of public debt|Section IV]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment]] dismissed all of the claims that slave owners had been injured by the freeing of the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html Fourteenth Amendment and related resources at the Library of Congress]; [https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#14 National Archives (USA): 14th Amendment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807–08, in [[Prussia]], statesman [[Baron Heinrich vom Stein]] introduced a [[Prussian reforms|series of reforms]], the [[Prussian reforms#Edict of October 1807|principal of which]] was the [[abolition of serfdom]] with indemnification to territorial lords.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Haiti]] was [[Haiti indemnity controversy|required to pay an indemnity of 150,000,000 francs to France]] in order to atone for the loss suffered by the [[France|French]] slave owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Hallward |url=http://newleftreview.org/II/27/peter-hallward-option-zero-in-haiti |title=Peter Hallward: Option Zero in Haiti. New Left Review 27, May-June 2004 |publisher=Newleftreview.org |date= |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peru]], [[Antonio Salinas y Castañeda]] (1810–1874), a wealthy Peruvian landowner and conservative politician, led the meeting of the main landowners of the country for an indemnity after slavery abolition and ruled the commission who promoted the immigration of Asians to replace former slaves as a workforce during Ramón Castilla government.

===Costs of war===
The nation that wins a war may insist on being paid compensations for the costs of the war, even after having been the instigator of the war. 
* Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95]], the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] required that [[China]] pay [[Japan]] the sum of 200,000,000 [[tael]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Shimonoseki|title=Treaty of Shimonoseki {{!}} 1895, China-Japan|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the massacres of foreigners during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the defeated [[Qing Empire]] were to pay 450&amp;nbsp;million [[tael]]s of fine silver as indemnity over a course of 39 years to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance|eight nations]] involved.&lt;ref name="spence"&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. [1991] (1991), ''The Search for Modern China'', WW Norton &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0-393-30780-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[exchange rate]]s at the time, this was equal to 335 million US [[gold dollar]]s or [[Pound sterling|£]]67&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="spence"/&gt;

{{Financial market participants}}

An '''investor''' is a person that allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return.&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Reasonable Investor(s)|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=95|issue=461|page=466|first=Tom C.W.|last=Lin|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of investments include: [[stock|equity]], [[Bond (finance)|debt]] [[Security (finance)|securities]], [[real estate]], [[currency]], [[commodity]], [[Exonumia|token]], derivatives such as put and call [[Option (finance)|options]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]], etc. This definition makes no distinction between those in the primary and secondary markets.  That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both investors.  An investor who owns a stock is a [[shareholder]].

==Essential quality==
The assumption of risk in anticipation of gain but recognizing a higher than average possibility of loss. The term "speculation" implies that a business or investment risk can be analyzed and measured, and its distinction from the term "investment" is one of degree of risk. It differs from [[gambling]], which is based on random outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Barron's&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Investors can include stock traders but with this distinguishing characteristic: investors are owners of a company which entails responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370541547078|title=Looking at Corporate Governance from the Investor's Perspective |publisher=Sec.gov |date=April 21, 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of investors==
There are two types of investors, retail investors and [[institutional investor]]s:

===Retail investor===
* Individuals gambling in games of chance.
* Individual investors (including [[Trust law|trusts]] on behalf of individuals, and umbrella companies formed by two or more to pool investment funds)
* [[Collecting|Collectors]] of [[art]], [[antique]]s, and other things of value
* [[Angel investor]]s (individuals and groups)
* [[Sweat equity]] investor

===Institutional investor===
* [[Venture capital]] and [[private equity]] funds, which serve as investment collectives on behalf of individuals, companies, pension plans, insurance reserves, or other funds.
* [[Business]]es that make investments, either directly or via a captive fund
* [[Investment trust]]s, including [[real estate investment trust]]s
* [[Mutual fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, and other funds, ownership of which may or may not be [[Public company|publicly traded]] (these funds typically pool money raised from their owner-subscribers to invest in securities)
* [[Sovereign wealth fund]]s

Investors might also be classified according to their [[Investor profile|styles]]. In this respect, an important distinctive [[Behavioral economics|investor psychology]] trait is [[risk aversion|risk attitude]].

==Investor protection==
The term "investor protection" defines the entity  of efforts  and activities to observe, safeguard and enforce the rights and claims of a person in his role as an investor. This includes advice and legal action.  The assumption of a need of protection is based on the experience that financial investors  are usually structurally inferior to providers of financial services and products due to lack of professional knowledge, information or experience. Countries with stronger investor protections tend to grow faster than those with poor investor protections.  Investor protection includes accurate financial reporting by public companies so the investors can make an informed decision.  Investor protection also includes fairness of the market which means all participants in the market have access to the same information.

===Through government===
Investor protection through government is regulations and enforcements by government agencies to ensure that market is fair and fraudulent activities are eliminated.  An example of a government agency that provides protection to investors is the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), which works to protect reasonable investors in America.&lt;ref name="Reasonable" /&gt;

===As individuals===
Investor protection through individual is the strategy that one utilizes to minimize loss. Individual investors can protect themselves by purchasing only shares of businesses that they understand, or only those that remain calm through market volatility.

An individual investor may be protected by the strategy he uses in investment. The strategy includes an appropriate price of the stocks or assets in the right time he enters. It's hard to fix what "an appropriate price" is, and when it is appropriate because no one makes a purchase or a sale absolutely in his most favorable situation. However, determination may be made when the price of such share or assets are "undervalued" comparing to its potentiality. This is called the margin of safety  where an investor can feel at ease when the price of the stocks is alarmingly down.

==Investment tax structures==
While a tax structure may change, it is generally accepted that long-term capital gains will maintain their position of providing an advantage to investors. This is countered by the opinion that after-tax returns should be considered, especially during retirement, on the basis that allocation to equities is in general, lower, than any returns and should be maximized, to the most lucrative extent. In the current circumstances, long-term capital gains offer one of the best opportunities in the [[United States]] tax structure.

It is made easier for investors to generate long-term capital gains by the employment of [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs); the process if investment in broad-based index funds, without required indicators. Although some outlandish ETFs could provide investors with the opportunity to venture into previously inaccessible markets and employ different strategies, the unpredictable nature of these holdings frequently result in short-term transactions,  surprising tax equations and general performance results issues.

Company dividends are paid from after-tax profits, with the tax already deducted. Therefore, shareholders are given some respite with a preferential tax rate of 15% on "qualified dividends" in the event of the company being domiciled in the United States. Alternatively, in another country having a double-taxation treaty with the USA, accepted by the IRS;. Non-qualified dividends paid by other foreign companies or entities; for example, those receiving income derived from interest on bonds held by a mutual fund, are taxed at the regular and generally higher rate of income tax. When applied to 2013, this is on a sliding scale up to 39.6%, with an additional 3.8% surtax for high-income taxpayers ($200,000 for singles, $250,000 for married couples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment Tax Basics for All Investors|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072313/investment-tax-basics-all-investors.asp|website=Investopedia.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline==
A disciplined and structured investment plan prevents emotional investing which can be related to impulsive buying. This factor can be utilized to counteract the sentiments of a marketplace, which is often reflective of the emotional state of an entire population. Short-term activity in stock prices or the broader markets can frequently be compared to impulsive actions. This is seen in the term "bull run" which can induce investors to leap into an investment, as opposed to a "bearish market" that could influence a "sell-off".  It is these types of market scenarios that can cause investors to abandon their investment strategies. Investor discipline is the ability to maintain an investment strategy even in the most tempting, or extreme conditions in the marketplace.

An established and popular method for stock market investors is [[Systematic Investment Plan]]s (SIPs) especially for those who have a regular, monthly surplus income. The provision for reaping maximum benefits from these plans is that a disciplined strategy is maintained, one of the foremost advantages for a successful investor. Consistency is closely associated with an investment strategy and can be related to various, adopted, proven techniques; for example, predicting outperforming funds, valuation, or a technical strategy. A strategic advantage that meets the required consistency is long-term investment, which in turn, offers investors long-term capital gains tax advantages.  While many investors try to exercise a long-term disciplined approach, the investment marketplace can provide various, tempting options; for instance, a sudden drop in the marketplace, or a pending worldwide event. This is particularly prevalent for retired investors, who are preserving their capital with care.

==Constant advantage for retirees==
In general, core indexes remain constant making it unnecessary for investors to move from one to another. Although an investor could transfer holdings; despite a maturation of the companies and their markets; a large-cap exchange-traded fund would never require being switched for a similar holding. A large-cap ETF will always remain so and an investor will usually want to retain at least a part allocation to large-cap equities in their portfolio.

It is consistency that is a significant advantage for ETF investors and one that makes it convenient to retain investment positions and benefit from long-term capital gains tax. Despite a potential reduction in the capital gains tax advantage, it is an advantage that should continue to provide some positive benefits in producing after-tax returns. This is a factor that could become an important issue in the future as taxes increase, affecting the lifestyles of retirees. It can be added to by additional taxes generated in short-term trading, exacerbating the situation, due to normal income-tax rates increases.

==Role of the financier==
{{redirect|financier}}
A '''financier''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪ|n|ə|n|ˈ|s|ɪər}}; {{IPA-fr|finɑ̃sje|lang}}) is a person  whose primary occupation is either facilitating or directly providing investments to up-and-coming or established [[companies]] and [[businesses]], typically involving large sums of money and usually involving [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]], [[mergers and acquisitions]], [[leveraged buyout]]s, [[corporate finance]], [[investment banking]], or large-scale [[asset management]]. A financier makes money through this process when his or her investment is paid back with interest,&lt;ref name="Freixas"&gt;Xavier Freixas, Jean-Charles Rochet, ''Microeconomics of Banking'' (2008), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; from part of the company's [[private equity|equity]] awarded to them as specified by the business deal, or a financier can generate income through [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]], performance, and management fees. A financier can also promote the success of a financed business by allowing the business to take advantage of the financier's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Landström, ''Handbook of Research on Venture Capital'' (2007), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The more experienced and capable the financier is, the more the financier will be able to contribute to the success of the financed entity, and the greater reward the financier will reap.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin H. Neave, ''Modern Financial Systems: Theory and Applications'' (2009), p.8, &lt;/ref&gt; The term, financier, is [[French language|French]], and derives from ''[[finance]]'' or ''payment''. 

Financier is a term used to describe someone who handles money. Certain financier avenues require degrees and licenses including [[venture capitalist]]s, [[hedge fund]] managers, [[Trust Fund Manager|trust fund managers]], [[accountant]]s, [[stockbroker]]s, [[financial advisors]], or even [[treasurer|public treasurers]]. Personal investing on the other hand, has no requirements and is open to all by means of the [[stock market]] or by word of mouth requests for money. A financier "will be a specialized financial intermediary in the sense that it has experience in [[Liquidation|liquidating]] the type of firm it is lending to".&lt;ref name="Freixas"/&gt;

===Perceptions===
Economist [[Edmund Phelps]] has argued that the financier plays a role in directing capital to investments that governments and social organizations are constrained from playing:

{{quote|[T]he pluralism of experience that the financiers bring to bear in their decisions gives a wide range of entrepreneurial ideas a chance of insightful evaluation. And, importantly, the financier and the entrepreneur do not need the approval of the state or of social partners. Nor are they accountable later on to such social bodies if the project goes badly, not even to the financier's investors. So projects can be undertaken that would be too opaque and uncertain for the state or social partners to endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europainstitut.at/upload/publikationen/publikation_39.pdf|title=Dynamic Capitalism|author=Edmund S. Phelps|author-link=Edmund Phelps|publisher=[[Europa-Institut]]|date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of the financier has been distinguished from that of a mere capitalist based on the asserted higher level of judgment required of the financier.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling Elliott, ed., ''Good Roads: Devoted to the Construction and Maintenance of Roads'' (1896), Vol. 24, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; However, financiers have also been mocked for their perceived tendency to generate wealth at the expense of others, and without engaging in tangible labor. For example, humorist [[George Helgesen Fitch]] described the financier as "a man who can make two dollars grow for himself where one grew for some one else before".&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;George Fitch, ''Vest Pocket Essays'' (1916), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific investors' guidelines==
Specific investment practices are suggested to  maintain an ethical behaviour based on principles universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/investing-as-a-christian-reaping-where-you-have-not-sown-by-paul-mills/|title=Investing as a Christian: Reaping where you have not sown by Paul Mills - Jubilee Centre|date=17 June 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Socially responsible investing==
[[Socially responsible investing]] is recommended in all types of investment.

==Cameras==
===RED ONE===
[[File:Redonecamera.JPG|thumb|The RED ONE in a simple setup]]

The RED ONE was RED Digital Cinema’s first production camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk/examples/redcamera/redcamera.htm|title=The RED Digital Camera Company|work=digital-intermediate.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an S35mm image plane, the RED ONE displays a natural depth of field from 2K to over 4K resolutions.&lt;ref name="red.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-one|title=RED ONE|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first RED ONEs were outfitted with the 12 megapixel MYSTERIUM sensor, capable of capturing up to 120 frames per second at 2K resolution and 30 frames per second at 4K resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simdigital.com/rental_product.aspx?pid=333|title=RENTALS|work=simdigital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only possible acquisition format is REDCODE RAW.
The cameras were initially sold with a CF card slot that later could be replaced with a REDMAG module.
The second generation, RED ONE MYSTERIUM-X has a 14 megapixel MYSTERIUM-X sensor. It captures up to 120 frames per second at 2K resolution and up to 30 frames per second at 4K resolution.  With the upgraded sensor, the RED ONE MYSTERIUM-X offers more dynamic range, higher sensitivity and enhanced color management tools than the RED ONE MYSTERIUM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-one#features|title=RED ONE|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSMC2===
DSMC2 cameras are modular and can not be customised in various configurations. Several lens mounts can be attached to the camera. Differences to the former DSMC line are reduced size and weight, cable-less connections, as well as the addition of [[Apple ProRes|Apple ProRes]] and [[Avid DNx|Avid DNx]].

==REDCODE==
REDCODE RAW (.R3D) is a proprietary file format that employs wavelet compression to reduce the RAW data coming off the sensor. This allows reduced file sizes while still keeping all advantages of a non-destructive RAW workflow.
In the beginning REDCODE was a JPEG2000 12bit linear file stream with PCM sound without encryption. Several third party applications were able to read and convert to other file format such as Cineform RAW. Redcode started as having two different options, named Redcode 28 and Redcode 36, later a 42 option was added.
With the introduction of the DSMC line compression ratios were introduced, making

===HDRx===
With the DSMC line HDRx was introduced as extension to Frame Summing asset; allowing the shooter to get up to 6 extra stops of dynamic range on a shot.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}

==RCP Development Kit==
Announced at NAB 2013 and launched in 2014, The RCP Development Kit is a SDK (software development kit) that allows programmers to create custom applications to control their camera via mobile device, computer, or micro-controller. The kit included the RCP Bridge, a wireless module that allows apps to communicate with the camera. The bridge supports a wireless communication range of approximately 50 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/07/red-wireless-control/|title=Red adds wireless camera control module, software development kit|author=Zach Honig|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workflow==

=== REDCINE-X PRO ===
REDCINE-X PRO is a free-of-charge post-processing software collection developed by RED, built specifically for RED camera systems. It includes a coloring toolset, integrated timeline, and post effects software collection for both stills and motion. The post-production software allows for non-destructive manipulation of raw .R3D files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/redcine-x|title=REDCINE-X PRO|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;REDCINE-X was the first workflow software developed solely by Red.  Like REDCINE, RED offered it as an end-to-end workflow solution for Red customers. It preceded the current REDCINE-X PRO.

With REDCINE-X PRO, users can mark frames while shooting and access those specific frames within their timeline. Additionally, there are features like A.D.D. (Advanced DRAGON [[Bayer_filter|Debayer]]), a new algorithm for Dragon that analyzes every pixel, plus grading and RAW adjustment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2014/02/red-epic-dragon-camera-a-d-d-advanced-debayer-upgrade-few-months/|title=RED DRAGON Camera is Getting A.D.D. &amp; General Upgrades May Start in the Next Few Months|work=No Film School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Previous Workflow Software====

"RED Alert!" was the first form of workflow made available to RED owners/operators, though it was more of a diagnostic tool. It allowed RED ONE users to tweak [[Bayer_filter|debayer]] settings and render out to dpx/tiff/mov.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalfilms.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/red-post-–-the-easy-way/&lt;/ref&gt;

REDCINE was the first end-to-end workflow for RED users. A third-party company developed the software, and RED provided the [[Software Development Kit|SDK]].

===Hardware accelerators===
====RED ROCKET====

Red Rocket is an internal PCI Express card that is capable of 4K, 2K, or 1080p real-time [[debayering]] and video playback of R3D files coming from Mysterium and Mysterium-X sensors. It can be used to accelerate video editing in compatible Non-linear editing systems, outputting the image via HD-SDI to a user-supplied monitor. A component of the Red Rocket allows users to convert the HD-SDI signal to four HDMI outputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-rocket|title=RED ROCKET®|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====RED ROCKET-X====

RED ROCKET-X is an internal PCI Express card optimized for the 6K RED DRAGON sensor and is designed to accelerate the processing of R3D workflow, regardless of resolution. Compared to RED ROCKET, RED ROCKET-X processes and transcodes files up to five times faster.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Debayering subpar asset.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}

===Third party workflow systems===

RED offers the RED Apple Workflow Installer, which allows R3D RAW settings within Final Cut Pro X. Other applications include support for QuickTime to use .R3D files, and plugins for Adobe Photoshop,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.red.com/downloads/508ebcee17ef022b21000558&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Final Cut Pro X, and Sony Vegas Pro.

==Notable accessories==
===3-Axis lens control system===
The RED 3-Axis lens control system is a turn-key wireless lens control kit for driving focus, iris and zoom. Included is the T.H.C. (Tactical Hand Controller), a wireless remote that allows the operator to adjust lens settings from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/learn/product-demos/red-3-axis-lens-control-system|title=RED 3-AXIS LENS CONTROL SYSTEM|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first company's project, the SINOP business centre, has been put into operation and further sold to the Moscow's RBM Capital management company for 2 billion rubles in 2014.&lt;ref name="dp-zingarevich" /&gt;
The reconstruction of the historic building of the Stables Department was projected to host an apart-hotel in the building. The company signed an investment contract with St. Petersburg authorities in 2010 and got a construction permit in 2013. But historic preservation activists opposed the project. As a result of media attention being garnered by the activists, in early 2016, the city authorities proposed the investor, which had already invested 1.2 billion rubles, a few sites in St. Petersburg for construction of hotels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/06/23/131 Смольный простил Зингаревичам миллиард]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nb.dp.ru/a/2016/05/06/Smolnij_oficialno_videl/ Смольный официально выделил Зингаревичам участки для строительства гостиниц]&lt;/ref&gt;

"My vision for what TRANSCO CLSG can do for Africa, is creating a cheaper, more reliable, more expansive energy network. Additionally I envisage a starting point for efforts in future cooperation, pooling risks, sharing costs, and gaining for economies of scale," said Sherif.

==TRANSCO CLSG==

In January, 2006, Members of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) established articles of agreement establishing a new [[West African Power Pool]] (WAPP) organization. The objective of the WAPP is to establish a regional [[electricity]] market in West Africa through the development of key priority infrastructures that will permit accessibility to economic energy resources, to all member states of the ECOWAS. The Côte d'Ivoire – Liberia – Sierra Leone – Guinea Interconnection Project is one of the major sub-programs of the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP), with the aim to integrate the four post conflict countries into the same regional electricity market; by a high capacity transmission interconnection from Côte d'Ivoire to Guinea through Sierra Leone and Liberia. Supply of adequate and reliable electric power supply will improve security, good governance, the development of industry as well as improve the quality life of local communities.

Cote 'd'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are part of what many consider a flagship electricity project that could pay off handsomely for Sub-Saharan Africa - and spark an economic transformation for countries struggling to stay afloat. Andrew M Herscowitz, the Coordinator for US President Barack Obama's Power Africa and Trade Africa initiatives has said that investment in energy infrastructure in Africa will help unlock potential in what is already the world's fastest-growing continent, with positive results for global growth.

[[File:Powerintegration.jpg|thumb|Mohammed Mohammed Sherif eyeing electricity integration through TRANSCO CLSG]]The CLSG's line is a 1,303 kilometer stretch, coming from Man to Danane; from Danane to Yekepa; from Yekepa to Buchanan; from Buchanan to Mount Coffee; from Mount Coffee to Bo Waterside, which provides huge opportunities for Liberia. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), through its West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) has made regional power grid access a priority for the next decade. Thus, the establishment of TRANSCO CLSG has created burgeoning opportunities across the region.

The WAPP intends to integrate the various national power systems into a unified regional electricity market - with the expectation that such mechanism would, over the medium to long-term, assure the citizens of ECOWAS member states a stable and reliable electricity supply at affordable costs, facilitating the balanced development of diverse energy resources for their collective economic benefit, through long-term energy sector cooperation, unimpeded energy transit and increasing cross-border electricity trade.

It brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as [[snack]]s, local favourite dishes, [[fruits]], clothes, shoes, [[toy]]s, balloons, watch and alarm clocks, knick-knacks and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. Unauthorized copies of DVDs, CDs and computer software are often sold at a pasar malam. 

Pasar malam might resemble a night [[festival]] or a [[fair|fairground]], where fair games and kiddy rides, like mini [[carousel]] or mini train ride may also present. Several quintessential fair snacks like [[cotton candy]], [[ice cream]], [[hot dog]]s and grilled sausages are also popular, next to the offerings of traditional local delicacies. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. [[Bargaining|Haggling]] over prices is a common practice at such markets.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bezoekers op de Pasar Malam te Batavia TMnr 60022441.jpg|thumb|Pasar Malam in Batavia, [[Dutch East Indies]], period 1900-1940]]
In Indonesian archipelago, markets are traditionally held in different days with locations rotating among participating villages. This traditional economic custom is known as ''Hari Pasaran'' (lit. "market days") in [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. After being further developed, market was established more permanently like it is today. The night market is regarded as the continuation of this non-permanent market culture. Night market are usually held during special occasion or festival, such as [[Sekaten]] festival in Java, or held in [[Ramadhan]] nights, approximately a week before [[Lebaran]]. 

After the discovery of [[electricity]] and [[lightbulb]], the night markets were held more frequently in colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] in early 20th century. The most notable one is [[Pasar Gambir]], a night market fair held in 1906 and yearly from 1921 until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1942, in the Koningsplein, Batavia, [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], [[Jakarta]], Indonesia) to celebrate the birthday of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. It has become the predecessor of the annual [[Jakarta Fair]] and [[The Hague|Den Haag]]'s [[Tong Tong Fair]] which are actually a night market and festival held for several weeks.

==Indonesia==
[[File:Pasar Malam Rawasari 8.JPG|thumb|right|Kiddy ride in a Pasar Malam in Jakarta]]
In [[Java]], especially in the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] royal cities [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]], the grand week-long pasar malam is usually held annually during the [[Sekaten]] festival to celebrate [[Mawlid]] or the birthday of prophet [[Muhammad]]. During colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] the annual Pasar Malam was held in [[Pasar Gambir]] (today [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka square]]) and become the predecessor of modern [[Jakarta]]'s annual [[Jakarta Fair]]. 

Today, several ''[[kecamatan]]'' (district) in Jakarta and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly pasar malam, usually every Saturday night in a nearby ''[[alun-alun]]'' square, open fields or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling variety of goods and foods, some pasar malam also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini [[carousel]] or mini train ride. In [[Palembang]], a popular pasar malam is located on front of Kuto Besak Fort on the bank of [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]]. This pasar malam sells local dishes and snacks such as [[pempek]], lenggang and tekwan, and also offers souvenirs and handy crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Indonesia Kaya | title = Pasar Malam Sungai Musi, Representasi Kearifan Lokal Palembang | language = Indonesian | url = http://www.indonesiakaya.com/kanal/detail/pasar-malam-sungai-musi-representasi-kearifan-lokal-palembang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commonly used in physiology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, sports/exercise studies and psychophysiology laboratories to record and analyse physiological signals from human or animal subjects or from isolated organs. The system consists of an input device connected to a [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS]] computer using a [[USB]] cable and LabChart software which is supplied with the PowerLab and provides the recording, display and analysis functions. The use of PowerLab and supplementary [[ADInstruments]] products have been demonstrated on the Journal of Visualised Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jove.com/search.php?q=adinstruments JOVE: Journal of Visualised Experiments] using PowerLab&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''MacLab''' unit was developed in the late 1980s to run with only [[Macintosh]] computers to perform computer-based [[data acquisition]] and analysis. The MacLab product range was renamed "PowerLab" in 1997 to reflect the cross-platform nature of the system.

The PowerLab system is essentially a peripheral device designed to perform various functions needed for [[data acquisition]], [[signal conditioning]] and pre-processing.&lt;ref name="powerlab" &gt;{{cite web  | title = Pushing Hardware to the Limits. | page  =  | work =   | publisher = Apple Inc Online | year = 2003   | url = https://www.apple.com/au/pr/casestudies/2003/09/adinstruments/scientific5.html| accessdate = 2008-12-22 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versatile display options and analysis functions are complemented by the ability to export data to other software (such as Microsoft Excel).

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Front office quantitative analyst===
In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

'''''Rise of Industry''''' is a business [[tycoon game]], developed by British indie team Dapper Penguin Studios and published by Kasedo Games. The game sees players build and manage their industrial empire as they attempt to grow and expand in the early 20th century. 

The game was released to [[early access]] on February 9, 2018, primarily through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com|GOG]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Gameplay ==
In ''Rise of Industry'', players begin with a sum of money and a map on which to build which is shared with several AI controlled towns and villages. It is your aim as the player to build an industrial empire by supplying these towns and villages with the products they demand.

There are currently two main game modes, Career and Sandbox. In career mode, the player must choose a specialism in which to begin their empire. There are four specialisms to choose from: Gathering, Farming, Industry and Logistics. While all remain open for the player to use, the chosen specialism will grant more Research &amp; Development points, which are used to upgrade in the tech tree. In Sandbox mode, all unlocks are available and the player can build without research and financial limitations.

A game is played on a map which is broken up into regions, each requiring the player to buy a permit in order to build within that region. There are two permit types; a full build permit which enables you to build anything within that region and a logistical permit which will allow the placement of network elements such as railway tracks and roads but not buildings. The player can then start to place buildings such as factories, farms, gatherers etc and then sell products to towns and villages requiring them. The price paid for your products is set by a global supply and demand system. The more of a product that is available, the less money you will receive, however towns will pay a premium for good that aren't as plentiful. The towns won't just rely on the player to get produce though. They will look to either produce a demanded item themselves, or look for a trade connection with neighbouring towns. 

Trade routes play a large part in the game as a function to move your products from A to B. The player can create a trade route for a variety of transport including trucks, boats, trains and zeppelins with each mode of transport having an advantage over an other depending on the distance and capacity needed for each route.

== Development ==
The game was originally named ''Project Automata'' in early development. Its name was changed to ''Rise of Industry'' in early 2017.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

''Rise of Industry'' was released as a [[pre-alpha]] version on indie video game store, [[itch.io]] in order to gain player feedback in order to improve gameplay before the official [[early access]] release. During this time, Rise of Industry became the most purchased game of 2017 on Itch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/itch-io-had-a-bumper-2017-adding-100000-new-projects/|title=Itch.io Had A Bumper 2017, Adding 100,000 New Projects|date=2018-01-05|work=Kotaku Australia|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itch.io/blog/19998/itchio-year-in-review-2017|title=itch.io year in review 2017 - itch.io|website=itch.io|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun|''Rock Paper Shotgun'']] said that ''Rise of Industry''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s early access release was "full of neat ideas" but that "they might wait until further updates to play again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/27/rise-of-industry-early-access-review/#more-520439|title=Premature Evaluation: Rise of Industry|date=2018-02-27|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called it a "fairly deep sim", although they thought that the lack of flexibility in the game "could put people off".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/production-sim-rise-of-industry-enters-early-access/|title=Production sim Rise of Industry enters Early Access|last=|first=|date=|work=PC Gamer|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' however praised Dapper Penguin Studios for "their total openness to their community" and "great willingness to listen to player feedback", stating "this is exactly how an Early Access release should be handled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/02/12/get-deep-into-logistics-with-rise-of-industry/289885/|title=Get Deep into Logistics with Rise of Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=Hardcore Gamer|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Greene initially formulated some of the ideas in ''The 48 Laws of Power'' while working as a writer in [[Hollywood]] and concluding that today's power elite shared similar traits with powerful figures throughout history.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school, and met a [[book packaging|book packager]] named Joost Elffers.&lt;ref name="LATimes-in-house-guru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt; Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and six months later, Elffers requested that Greene write a treatment.&lt;ref name=LATimes-in-house-guru/&gt;

''The 48 Laws of Power'' has sold over 1.2 million copies in the United States and has been translated into 24 languages.&lt;ref name=LATimes-in-house-guru/&gt; ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' called the book a "mega cult classic", and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that ''The 48 Laws of Power'' turned Greene into a "cult hero with the hip-hop set, Hollywood elite and prison inmates alike".&lt;ref name=LATimes-in-house-guru/&gt;&lt;ref name="FastCompany"&gt;Johnson, Lynn.

{{Eastern Slavic name|Stepanovich|Chernomyrdin}}
'''Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Степа́нович Черномы́рдин}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈvʲiktər sʲtʲɪˈpanəvʲɪtɕ tɕɪrnɐˈmɨrdʲɪn|IPA}}; 9 April 1938{{spaced ndash}}3 November 2010) was a [[Russia]]n politician. He was the first chairman of the [[Gazprom]] energy company and the longest-serving [[Prime Minister of Russia]] (1992–1998) based on consecutive years. He was a key figure in Russian politics in the 1990s, and a participant in the transition from a [[Planned economy|planned]] to a [[Market economy|market]] economy. From 2001 to 2009, he was Russia's ambassador to [[Ukraine]]. After that he was designated as a presidential adviser.&lt;ref name="kremlin110609"/&gt;

Chernomyrdin is known in Russia and [[List of countries where Russian is an official language|Russian-speaking countries]] for his unique language style, containing numerous [[malapropism]]s and [[Syntax|syntactic]] errors.&lt;ref name="dosuga.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dosuga.net/?type=marazm&amp;seq=cherno&amp;mk=on&amp;num=|title=Collection of Chernomyrdin's quotes at a Russian humour website (in Russian)|publisher=Dosuga|date=25 August 1998|accessdate=3 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706221951/http://www.dosuga.net/?type=marazm&amp;seq=cherno&amp;mk=on&amp;num=|archive-date=6 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his sayings became [[aphorism]]s and [[idiom]]s in the [[Russian language]], the most famous being his expression ''"We wanted the best, but it turned out like always."'' ({{lang-ru|Хотели как лучше, а получилось как всегда}}).&lt;ref name="dushenko.ru"&gt;[http://www.dushenko.ru/news_archive/21/ A story of the main Chernomyrdin's proverb by Konstantin Dushenko, an aphorism collector (in Russian)]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernomyrdin died on 3 November 2010 after a long illness. He was buried beside his wife in [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] on 5 November, and his funeral was broadcast live on Russian [[Television in Russia|federal TV channels]].&lt;ref name=rbc/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Chernomyrdin was born in Chernyi Otrog, Orenburg Oblast, Russian SFSR. His father was a labourer and Viktor was one of five children. Chernomyrdin completed school education in 1957 and found employment as a mechanic in an [[oil refinery]] in [[Orsk]]. He worked there until 1962, except for his [[Conscription#Russia|military service]] from 1957 to 1960. His other occupations on the plant during this period included machinist, operator and chief of technical installations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

He became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] in 1961. In 1962, he was admitted to Kuybyshev Industrial Institute (which was later renamed [[Samara Polytechnical Institute]]). In his entrance exams he performed very poorly. He failed the maths sections of the test and had to take the exam again, getting a C. He got only one B, in Russian language, and Cs in the other tests. He was admitted only because of very poor competition. In 1966, he graduated from the institute. In 1972, he completed further studies at the Department of Economics of the Union-wide Polytechnic Institute by correspondence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Early career==
[[File:Оренбургский газоперерабатывающий завод. В. С. Черномырдин и А. Н. Косыгин..jpg|thumb|left|Chernomyrdin with Soviet Deputy Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] in 1975]]
Chernomyrdin began developing his career as a politician when he worked for the CPSU in [[Orsk]] between 1967 and 1973. In 1973, he was appointed the director of the natural gas refining plant in [[Orenburg]], a position which he held until 1978. Between 1978 and 1982, Chernomyrdin worked in the heavy industry arm of the CPSU [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]].

In 1982, he was appointed deputy Minister of the natural gas industries of the [[Soviet Union]]. Concurrently, beginning from 1983, he directed Glavtyumengazprom, an industry association for natural gas resource development in [[Tyumen Oblast]]. During 1985–1989 he was the minister of gas industries.

==Founder of Gazprom==
In August 1989, under the leadership of Chernomyrdin, the [[Ministry of Gas Industry]] was transformed into the ''State Gas Concern'', [[Gazprom]], which became the country's first [[state corporation|state-corporate enterprise]]. Chernomyrdin was elected its first chairman. The company was still controlled by the state, but now the control was exercised through shares of stock, 100% of which were owned by the state.&lt;ref name="faq_jsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.gazpromquestions.ru/?id=10 |title=Gazprom – Joint Stock Company |publisher=Gazprom |accessdate=18 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122202622/http://eng.gazpromquestions.ru/?id=10 |archivedate=22 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Marshall I.|title=Petrostate: Putin, Power and the New Russia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|chapter=5|isbn=978-0-19-534073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Union dissolved in late 1991, assets of the former Soviet state in the gas sector were transferred to newly created national companies such as [[Ukrgazprom]] and [[Turkmengazprom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarentsen|first=Maarten|title=National reforms in European gas|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gazprom kept assets located in the territory of Russia, and was able to secure a monopoly in the gas sector.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt;

Gazprom's political influence increased markedly after Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed the company's chairman Chernomyrdin as his [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] in 1992. [[Rem Viakhirev]] took Chernomyrdin's place as Chairman both of the Board of Directors and of the Managing Committee.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; Gazprom was one of the backbones of the country's economy in 1990s, though the company underperformed during that decade. In the 2000s, however, Gazprom became the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest [[Economy of Russia|Russian company]].

==Prime Minister of Russia==
In May 1992, [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed Chernomyrdin as Deputy Prime Minister in charge of fuel and energy.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; On 14 December 1992, Chernomyrdin was confirmed by the VII Congress of People's Deputies of Russia as Prime Minister.

While he had been voicefully critical of his predecessor Gaidar, Chernomyrdin largely continued Gaidar's policies.&lt;ref name=authoritarian&gt;{{cite book |last=Gel-Man |first=Vladimir |year=2015  |title=Authoritarian Russia |url= |location=Pittsburgh |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995, he formed a political bloc called [[Our Home – Russia]], which was aimed at becoming the central force in the parliament, but failed in this, gaining only 10% of votes.

In 1995, Chernomyrdin signed a decree calling for the development of a national strategy for tiger conservation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Russia’s Tough Tigers - National Zoo{{!}} FONZ|url = http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2008/1/Amur_tigers.cfm|website = nationalzoo.si.edu|access-date = 2016-02-03|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160220033557/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/2008/1/amur_tigers.cfm|archivedate = 20 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 1995, as a result of [[Shamil Basayev]]-led terrorists [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis|taking over 1500 people hostage]] in [[Budyonnovsk]], negotiations between Chernomyrdin and Basayev led to a compromise which became a turning point for the [[First Chechen War]]. In exchange for the hostages, the [[Russian government]] agreed to halt military actions in Chechnya and begin a series of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/01/world/facing-threat-in-parliament-yeltsin-removes-3-ministers.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=Facing Threat in Parliament, Yeltsin Removes 3 Ministers|first=Steven|last=Erlanger|date=1 July 1995|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Boris Yeltsin was undergoing a heart operation on 6 November 1996, Chernomyrdin served as [[Acting President of the Russian Federation|Acting President]] for 23 hours.&lt;ref name="HoffmanWashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=David|title=Yeltsin Heart Operation Called a Success|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|date=6 November 1996|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/success110696.htm|accessdate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Decree of President of Russian Federation No. 1378 of 19 September 1996; [http://www.businesspravo.ru/Docum/DocumShow_DocumID_49072.html Temporary discharge of duty of President of Russian Federation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183246/http://www.businesspravo.ru/Docum/DocumShow_DocumID_49072.html |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernomyrdin remained Prime Minister until his sudden dismissal on 23 March 1998. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] in August, Yeltsin re-appointed Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, and attempted to groom him as his successor. However, the [[State Duma|Duma]] twice refused to confirm Chernomyrdin as the head of the government. Rather than to risk the third rejection and thus to force the [[Dissolution of parliament#Russia|dissolution of the State Duma]] and political crisis, Chernomyrdin withdrew his nomination and the President asked the more popular [[Yevgeny Primakov]] to [[Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet|form a new cabinet]].

==Diplomatic career==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 19 June 2001-1.jpg|thumb|right|Chernomyrdin with [[Vladimir Putin]] in June 2001 after being appointed as [[Ambassador of Russia to Ukraine]].]]
[[File:Виктор Черномырдин.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Viktor Chernomyrdin in 2010]]
During the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999 Chernomyrdin was a special representative of Russia in Yugoslavia. It was he who persuaded [[Slobodan Milošević]] to agree to an armistice and to place [[Kosovo]] under UN control.&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt;

In December 1999 Chernomyrdin was [[Russian legislative election, 1999|elected]] a member of the [[State Duma]]. In May 2001, [[Vladimir Putin]] appointed Chernomyrdin [[Ambassador of Russia to Ukraine]]. This action was interpreted by some Russian media agencies as a move to distance Chernomyrdin from the centre of [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]]. In 2003, he dismissed talk of an apology for the [[Holodomor|Holodomor Famine]] made by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4471256.stm|work=BBC|title=Ukraine demands 'genocide' marked|date=25 November 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 Chernomyrdin again strained the [[Russia–Ukraine relations|relations between Ukraine and Russia]] when he in an interview said "It is impossible to come to an agreement on anything with the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian leadership]]. If different people come in, we'll see". The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian foreign ministry]] said in a response it could declare Chernomyrdin "[[persona non grata]]" over the row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-301448.html|title=Russia warns it will hit back if Ukraine expels envoy – reports|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sayings ==
{{Copy section to Wikiquote}}
In Russian-speaking countries, Chernomyrdin is famous for his numerous [[malapropism]]s and [[Syntax|syntactically]] incorrect speech.&lt;ref name="dosuga.net"/&gt; His idioms received the name ''Chernomyrdinki'', and are somewhat comparable to [[Bushism]]s in style and effect.

One of his expressions ''"We wanted to do it better, but it turned out as always"'' (''Хотели как лучше, а получилось как всегда'' in Russian) about the economic reforms in Russia became a very popular proverb.&lt;ref name="dushenko.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=ru&amp;q=%22%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8+%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA+%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D1%88%D0%B5%22+%22%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8C+%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA+%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B4%D0%B0%22&amp;btnG=%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA&amp;lr= |title=Google search for the main Chernomyrdin's proverb quoted and re-used (in Russian)|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was uttered after a [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1993|highly unsuccessful monetary exchange]] performed by the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation|Russian Central Bank]] in July 1993.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Among his other sayings were:&lt;ref name="dosuga.net"/&gt;

'''Willie Revillame''' (born '''Wilfredo Buendia Revillame''', January 27, 1961) is a Filipino television host, singer, songwriter, businessman, actor and comedian.

==Life and career==
Revillame started out as the host of [[GMA Network]]'s noontime variety program ''[[Lunch Date]]'' in the early 1980s together with [[Randy Santiago]]. After his hosting stint he started appearing on different movies playing sidekick to big-named stars. In 1998, he started co-hosting the [[ABS-CBN]] noontime show "'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila". After the show was cancelled to make way for his big break in ''[[Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'', he also started appearing in [[Richard Loves Lucy]]. Other shows he hosted within the network were "Willingly Yours", ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'', and ''[[Wowowee]]'', as well as [[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] variety programs like ''[[Willing Willie]]'', ''[[Wil Time Bigtime]]'' and ''[[Wowowillie]]''.

On March 2015, Revillame marked his homecoming in [[GMA Network]] (his original home network), his long-awaited return to Philippine showbiz and to Philippine television via his newest weekly-variety program ''[[Wowowin]]'', airing on [[GMA Network]] every Sunday afternoon since May 10, 2015 until it became a weekday-variety program in February 2016 due to the huge popularity of the show.

==Business ventures==
Revillame is known for developing a business, the Wil Tower Mall near ABS-CBN Eugenio Lopez Drive in Quezon City with business partner [[Manny Villar]]. It held its grand opening on September 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/13/09/willies-mall-soon-rise-qc Wil Tower Mall]&lt;/ref&gt; Revillame is also a former owner of the restaurants W Bar and Wil Steak Town at Wil Events Place located near Wil Tower Mall and ABS-CBN along Sgt. Esguerra Avenue in South Triangle, Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. Wil Tower Mall was developed by the real estate firm Vista Land, but Revillame's holdings were sold to his business partner and friend, former Senator [[Manny Villar]].

Revillame was interviewed for the April 2015 episode of [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]] at his own rest house in [[Tagaytay|Tagaytay City]] after the signing of contract with [[GMA Network]]. During the interview, [[GMA Network|GMA 7]] broadcast journalist [[Jessica Soho]] said that Revillame is planning to build a 5-star resort-hotel located within the 5 hectare lot that he acquired from the Madrigal family. His own rest house is also located within the same lot.

==Personal life==
Revillame married Liz Almoro in a civil ceremony at Lipa, [[Batangas]] in March 2005, officiated by Mayor [[Vilma Santos]]. This was followed shortly by a church wedding in June 2005, their marriage annulled in 2008. Prior to his marriage to Almoro, Revillame was married to actress [[Princess Punzalan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/2536/Willie-Revillame-opens-up-about-the-women-in-his-life.aspx ABS-CBN.com - Willie Revillame Opens Up About the Women in His Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/181168/pep-princess-punzalan-is-happy-for-ex-husband-willie-revillames-success GMA News - PEP: Princess Punzalan Is Happy for Ex-Husband Willie Revillame's Success]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Undue weight|date=May 2013}}

On February 4, 2006, while Willie was hosting ''[[Wowowee]]'', the [[PhilSports Arena stampede]] occurred.

On August 25, 2007, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] dismissed criminal charges against Revillame in connection with the stampede. However, [[Secretary of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] [[Raul M. Gonzalez]] affirmed the charge against 14 others, including [[ABS-CBN]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/57523/(Update)-DOJ-drops-raps-vs-Revillame-over-Ultra-tragedy GMA NEWS.TV, DOJ drops raps vs Revillame over Ultra tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 3, 2009 episode of ''Wowowee'', during which the show was interrupted for live coverage of the transfer of President [[Cory Aquino]]'s remains from La Salle Greenhills to the [[Manila Cathedral]],  Revillame said that he could not make people happy while the entire country was mourning. The Alliance of Filipino Journalists denounced his remarks as a sign of disrespect towards Aquino. Revillame said he had no intention of defaming the former president and her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22736/Criticisms-mount-against-%20Wowowee-%20host-Willie-Revillame|title=Criticisms mount against Wowowee host Willie Revillame - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|publisher=PEP.ph}} Retrieved on 2011-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; ABS-CBN senior executive [[Cory Vidanes]] said the network supported Revillame's action, stating that his outburst did not run afoul of the Broadcast Code of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22858/abs-cbn?backs-willie-revillame-says-wowowee-host-did-not-violate-broadcast-code-of-the-philippines|title=ABS-CBN backs Willie Revillame; says Wowowee host did not violate Broadcast Code of the Philippines|publisher=PEP.ph|date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network entertainment official [[Johnny Manahan]] said Revillame was correct in saying that the footage should not have been inserted, but the way he said it was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/news/22768/%20PEP-EXCLUSIVE:%20-Johnny-Manahan%20speaks-up-for%20Willie-Revillame&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2010, Revillame went into another on-air tirade on his now-defunct noontime show "Wowowee", this time directing his anger at entertainment columnist and DZMM Radio host Jobert Sucaldito. Without mentioning him by name, he said he had enough of Sucaldito's alleged criticisms against the show having high-school contestants whose grades were below the passing mark for the Willie of Fortune segment and also ridiculing them on-screen. He threatened to resign from the show unless the ABS-CBN management dismissed Sucaldito, who described Revillame's rant as being "pikon" (Tagalog slang meaning 'touchy').&lt;ref&gt;http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20100506-268474/Willie-Revillame-threatens-to-resign-from-TVs-Wowowee&lt;/ref&gt; He went on an indefinite leave three weeks later after the network declined his resignation letter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/25/10/willie-revillame-takes-indefinite-break-wowowee&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference on August 9, 2010, Revillame announced that he was ending his contract with ABS-CBN, even if it is supposed to expire in September 2011. He also accused ABS-CBN of violating several provisions in his contract. He narrated that his decision came out of meetings between ABS-CBN production head Linggit Tan and network president Charo Santos-Concio regarding a return to the show on July 31. However, on July 20, Tan said the management will replace ''Wowowee'' with a [[Pilipinas Win na Win|new show]] on July 31 and also offered him a one-hour weekly show. She added negative feedback still prevailed among network employees about him going to work again. Despite the move, the network stated that Revillame's Wowowee tirade only highlighted his arrogance and stressed that the contract is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/271538/willie-revillame-rescinds-contract-with-abscbn&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2011, a "macho dance" by an apparently unhappy six-year-old boy on Revillame's primetime show, ''Willing Willie'', resulted in criticism, including the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development]] describing it as a case of child abuse. Revillame "sincerely and deeply" apologized for the segment, “which viewers may have found offensive or in bad taste.”&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20110325-327581/Willing-Willie-and-the-boy-who-wouldnt-smile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/28/11/boy-abused-%E2%80%98willing-willie%E2%80%99-dswd-says&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216365/entertainment/dswd-calls-for-censure-of-willie-for-boy-macho-dancer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/311671/revillame-s-hit-a-minor-causes-stir-cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]] pursued an investigation of the program for violating the law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/29/11/chr-investigate-jan-jan-case&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] allowed the arrest and prosecution of Revillame over the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres-Tupas|first1=Tetch|title=Willie Revillame ordered arrested over child abuse case|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/181276/willie-revillame-ordered-arrested-over-child-abuse-case|accessdate=October 18, 2015|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atty. Nards de Vera, lawyer of Revillame, clarified in a [[GMA News]] article that Revillame has already posted the bail for the two cases in September 2013, and does not need the warrant of arrest served against his client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/541138/news/metro/lawyer-on-ca-order-no-need-to-arrest-willie-he-already-posted-bail|title=Lawyer on CA order: No need to arrest Willie, he already posted bail | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 11, 2016, the 3rd division of the Court of Appeal (CA) had affirmed the Regional Trial Court Quezon City Judge Roberto Buenaventura Decision. The CA said that Judge Buenaventura hadn't committed no grave abuse of discretion. In the CA's Decision, written by Justice Maria Luisa Quijano-Padilla, on the arrest and to bring to trial Willie Revillame,  they said, " “as there is probable cause for the petitioner’s commission of a crime, his arrest and arraignment should now ensue so that this case may properly proceed to trial, where the merits of both parties’ evidence and allegations may be weighed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/194011/court-denies-revillame-plea-abuse-case | publisher = Philippine Daily Inquirer | title= Court denies Revillame plea in abuse case | accessdate = April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
