'''Anna Kennedy''' (born March 12, 1960) founded schools to provide an improved education and other facilities for special children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s. She has now expanded her support for these special children including two schools, a college, a respite home and a website with over 50,000 international followers &lt;ref name="Autism School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tescomagazine.com/mum-of-the-year/winners-2013/anna-kennedy.html|title=Autism School by Mum of the year award winner Anna Kennedy|publisher=''Tesco Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was appointed an OBE (Royal Reward for Inspirational Mother) Award by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] in 2012 for her services.&lt;ref name="OBE Reward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/story/2012-11-21/autism-mothers-obe/|title=Anna Awarded by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace|publisher=''[[ITV (TV network)]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anna born in [[Middlesbrough]], to Maria and Antonino Sammarone. She studied at Sacred Heart School Middlesbrough. Before leaving to Italy, she had set up a dance school which was owned and run by her for a number of years. She married Sean Kennedy, a qualified legal solicitor, in 1998.&lt;ref name="Anna’s Marriage "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1332830/A-truly-amazing-mother-When-Annas-autistic-sons-turned-away-26-schools-set-own.html|title=Anna Married to Sean Kennedy|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons, named Patrick and Angelo,&lt;ref name="award" /&gt; when these kids reached their school age, she then discovered that they were affected with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s.

==Turn in Anna's Life==
It was difficult for Anna and Sean to find a suitable education for their eight-year-old affected by Asperger Syndrome and a five-year-old with [[autism]], therefore they started a support group in their home which grew rapidly and was attended by 275 families.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tescomagazine.com/mum-of-the-year/winners-2013/anna-kennedy.html|title=Autism support group|publisher=''Tesco Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remortgaged their house in order to raise funds and to open a school with special educational needs for their kids.&lt;ref name="Autistic School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/248810.stm|title=Anna mortgaged her house to open the school|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|access-date=2016-09-26|date=1999-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hillingdon Manor School==
Anna and her husband prepared a feasibility report to convert a local school which was apparently to be demolished, into a school for Special Needs children.&lt;ref name="school"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tescomagazine.com/mum-of-the-year/winners-2013/anna-kennedy.html|title=School for special needs children|publisher=''Tesco Magazine''|access-date=2016-09-26|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was the place to play and laugh together in the playground for pupils who had been bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1332830/A-truly-amazing-mother-When-Annas-autistic-sons-turned-away-26-schools-set-own.html|title=School for Autistic Children|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, they took a huge financial risk by using their savings of £3000 and mortgaged their house in order to raise 627,000.&lt;ref name="Truly amazing mother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1332830/A-truly-amazing-mother-When-Annas-autistic-sons-turned-away-26-schools-set-own.html|title=Anna sets up her own school|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Volunteers were also coming out to help them which include carpenters, electricians and painters. Anna also approached the Probation Service for volunteers to come and help them. Finally school for autistic children was opened in 1999 with only 19 pupils.&lt;ref name="school"/&gt; Initially, this school had places for 14 children which were later increased to 63 places by 2002. The funding for places from local authority was based upon the condition that if parents of autistic children select this school as suitable place for their special children's needs.&lt;ref name="Autistic School"/&gt; This school is now building a brighter future with safe and structured education for 150 special children.&lt;ref name="special-school"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tescomagazine.com/mum-of-the-year/winners-2013/anna-kennedy.html|title=150 Special children in school|publisher=''Tesco Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was subject to an emergency [[Ofsted]] report in January 2017, the report for which was published in March. The inspection, the report of which was published in March 2017, found that the school does not meet all of the independent school standards that were checked during the inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/131940|title=Find an inspection report|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|date=2010-11-05|website=reports.ofsted.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">An '''audio signal''' is a representation of [[sound]], typically as an electrical [[voltage]] for [[analog signal]]s and a binary number for [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s. Audio signals have frequencies in the [[audio frequency]] range of roughly 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Human hearing range|limits of human hearing]]). Audio signals may be [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] directly, or may originate at a [[transducer]] such as a [[microphone]], [[Pickup (music technology)|musical instrument pickup]], [[phonograph]] cartridge, or [[tape head]]. [[Loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]] convert an electrical audio signal into sound.

[[Digital audio]] systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.1. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audio channel''' or '''audio track''' is an audio signal [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] in a [[data storage device|storage device]] or [[mixing console]], used in operations such as [[multi-track recording]] and [[sound reinforcement]].

== Signal flow ==
[[Audio signal flow|Signal flow]] is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a [[home audio]] system or long and convoluted in a [[recording studio]] and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large [[Mixing console|console]], external [[audio equipment]], and even different rooms.

==Parameters==
Audio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[nominal level]], [[Electric power|power]] level in [[decibel]]s (dB), and voltage level. The relation between power and voltage is determined by the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the signal path, which may be [[Single-ended signalling|single-ended]] or [[Balanced line|balanced]].

Audio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional [[Mixing console|mixing consoles]] are most commonly at [[line level]]. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a ''mic level''.

== Digital equivalent ==
The digital form of an audio signal is used in [[audio plug-in]]s and [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal.

A digital audio signal being sent through wire can use several formats including [[optical]] ([[ADAT]], [[TDIF]]), [[coaxial]] ([[S/PDIF]]), [[XLR connector|XLR]] ([[AES/EBU]]), and [[Audio over Ethernet|Ethernet]].

BBC R&amp;D is part of the wider [[BBC Design &amp; Engineering]], and is led by Andy Conroy, Controller Research &amp; Development.&lt;ref name="andyconroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015/09/introduction-to-the-controller|title=Introduction to the Controller|work=BBC R&amp;D Blog|date=9 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the North Lab moved into [[MediaCityUK]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]]  along with several other departments of the BBC, whilst the South Lab remained in [[BBC White City|White City]] in London.

==History==
[[Image:Rainbow over Kingswood Warren - geograph.org.uk - 137535.jpg|thumb|Former site at [[Kingswood Warren]]]]
The department as it stands today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as '''Research and Innovation'''  but has since reverted to its original name. '''BBC Research &amp; Development''' has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the [[peak programme meter]] (PPM) which became the basis for many world standards.

===Innovations===
It has also been involved in many well known consumer technologies such as [[teletext]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[NICAM]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It was at the forefront of development of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]], stereo FM, and [[Radio Data System|RDS]]. These innovations have led to [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Innovation]] in 1969, 1974, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2011.

In the 1970s, its engineers designed the famous [[LS3/5A]] studio monitor for use in [[outside broadcasting]] units.&lt;ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice&gt;Prakel, David (August 1979).

===Closure of Kingswood Warren and move to London and Salford===
In early 2010 the department had approximately 135 staff based at three locations:  White City in London, Kingswood Warren in [[Kingswood, Surrey]], and the R&amp;D (North Lab) at the BBC's Manchester offices at New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, [[Manchester]]. In early 2010 the Kingswood Warren site was vacated and the bulk of the department relocated to Centre House, in [[White City, London]] co-locating with the main campus of the BBC in London, whilst a significant number have moved to the new North Lab in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

==Future projects==
BBC R&amp;D engineers and researchers are currently active on approximately 50 projects, including 7 active national and international collaborative research efforts.

These include R&amp;D projects built around [[BBC Redux]]&lt;ref name="notube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|title=NoTube Archive Browser Experiment 1|work=NoTube Archive Browser|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306190402/http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|archive-date=6 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="james-archak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://custard-cat.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/archak-bbc-research-and-development.html|title=ArcHak|work=CustardCat|first=Bruce|last=James|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browser-extensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/08/-prototyping-weeknotes-29-2708.shtml|title=Prototyping Weeknotes #29|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=4296|title=BBC R&amp;D develops 'mood based navigation'|work=News|publisher=[[Digital TV Group]]|author=DTG staff|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/01/an-interface-for-mood-based-navigation.shtml|title=An Affective Interface for Mood-Based Navigation|first=Rosie|last=Campbell|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redux-mood-testing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/2009/10/mulitmedia_classification.shtml|work=Projects|title=Multimedia Classification|author=BBC Research and Development|accessdate=13 May 2012|quote=User Evaluation on BBC Redux (by BBC staff) …}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annual-2009-2010"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2009-2010.pdf|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 2009–2010|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Report 2010–2011|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2010-2011.pdf|page=5|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[proof of concept]] for the cross-platform, [[Flash video]]-based streaming version of the [[BBC iPlayer]].&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof13/Bird-Redux.pdf|first=Tom|last=Bird|date=28 May 2009|title=BBC Redux|publisher=[[UKNOF]] 13|location=Sheffield|pages=2–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''Balanced heave compensation''' is a technology engaging the principle of a [[balanced-arm lamp]] for offshore [[Motion compensator|motion compensation]].

== Working principle ==
The technical working principle can be summarized as converting the non-linear force of a gas spring or hydro-pneumatic spring into an adjustable, substantially linear force, by several mechanical measures. The technology comprises a series of patented inventions by NHLO licensed to and marketed by Seaqualize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seaqualize: Balanced heave compensation|url=http://www.nhlo.nl/seaqualize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research project ==
In cooperation with IHC and research partners MARIN and ECN a scale model of a first device comprising the technology, an offshore access bridge has been tested. Seaqualize is currently working on a full-scale prototype of the access bridge. The project has been subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Economical affairs as a Renewable Energy project.

The research project indicates balanced heave compensation enables a range of potential benefits compared to currently available solutions. This may lead to improvements and cost savings in (engaging) heave compensation systems.

== Comparison to traditional heave compensation systems ==
Balanced heave compensation (BHC) differs from traditional (spring based) [[Passive heave compensation|Passive Heave Compensation]] (PHC) and [[Active heave compensation|Active Heave Compensation]] ([[Active heave compensation|AHC]]) in several ways.

In traditional spring based heave compensation systems the movement of the mass is parallel to the movement of the spring cylinder. A passive heave compensation system is in effect a mass spring system: it stabilizes a certain mass in a single position of the spring, in that position only the spring and the mass are balanced. In other positions of the spring the mass and the spring are not balanced and the mass will tend to start moving towards the stabilized position due to residual forces in the spring.

Only in certain (preset) conditions a mass spring system can be beneficial for heave compensation: the spring, its excitation, the mass and the frequency of the excitation of the spring all need to be taken into account in order for a mass to be substantially stabilised in a moving environment. In other (unexpected) conditions, mass spring systems may experience unwanted effects such as load amplification: its mass may start to move viciously instead of being stabilised.

An active heave compensation system adds an active component to a traditional passive heave compensation system in order to counteract these residual forces / in order to counteract load amplification, in effect minimising the movement of the load.

In BHC systems the movement of the mass is not parallel to the movement of the spring, leading to significantly lower residual forces, and therefore lower requirements on the active components. In BHC systems, load amplification is unlikely to occur since the mass is substantially balanced in the whole range of movement of the spring. Residual forces are minimized and therefore unexpected conditions such as variations in the wave pattern have a negligible effect on the working principle. This leads to a better stabilisation of the mass compared to PHC systems.

An Active Balanced Heave compensation system (ABHC) adds an active component to a BHC for even further stabilisation of the mass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Bolster heath''' or '''cushion moorland''' is a type of vegetation community that features a patchwork of very low growing, tightly packed plants found at the limits of some [[Alpine climate|alpine]] environments. The [[cushion plant]]s form a smooth surfaced 'cushions' from several different plants, hence the common name of '''cushion heath'''.  The cushion growth habit provides protection against the desiccating wind and help keep the cluster warm.

Bolster heath is very slow growing and thus very fragile.  Most propagation is by slow expansion, although two species, ''[[Abrotanella forsteroides]]'' and ''[[Pterygopappus lawrencei]]'' produce enough viable seed to survive fire.  The other species are generally permanently destroyed by fire.

The soil in bolster heath is generally quite poor, often gravel with a thin layer of [[peat]].

The '''Bond albedo''', named after the American astronomer [[George Phillips Bond]] (1825–1865), who originally proposed it, is the fraction of [[power (physics)|power]] in the total [[electromagnetic radiation]] incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space.

Because the Bond albedo accounts for all of the light scattered from a body at all [[wavelength]]s and all [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]], it is a necessary quantity for determining how much energy a body absorbs.  This, in turn, is crucial for determining the [[equilibrium temperature]] of a body.

Because bodies in the outer Solar System are always observed at very low phase angles from the Earth, the only reliable data for measuring their Bond albedo comes from spacecraft.

==Phase integral==
The Bond albedo (''A'') is related to the [[geometric albedo]] (''p'') by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;A = pq&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is termed the ''phase integral'' and is given in terms of the directional scattered flux ''I''(''α'') into phase angle ''α'' (averaged over all wavelengths and azimuthal angles) as

:&lt;math&gt;q = 2\int_0^\pi \frac{I(\alpha)}{I(0)} \sin\alpha \, d\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase [[angle]] ''α'' is the angle between the source of the radiation (usually the Sun) and the observing direction, and varies from zero for light scattered back towards the source, to 180° for observations looking towards the source. For example, during opposition or looking at the full moon, α is very small, while backlit objects or the new moon have α close to 180°.

==Examples==
The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself).  This is in contrast to other definitions of  [[albedo]] such as the geometric albedo, which can be above 1. In general, though, the Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question.

The '''Byzantine text-type''' (also called '''Majority Text''', '''Traditional Text''', '''Ecclesiastical Text''', '''Constantinopolitan Text''', '''Antiocheian Text''', or '''Syrian Text''') is one of several [[Textual criticism#New Testament|text-types]] used in [[textual criticism]] to describe the textual character of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[New Testament]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]]. It is the form found in the largest number of surviving [[manuscript]]s, though not in the oldest. The New Testament text of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], the [[Patriarchal Text]], as well as those utilized in the [[lectionaries]], is based on this text-type. While considerably varying, it also underlies the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek text used for most Reformation-era translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. Modern translations mainly use [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] editions that conform more often to the [[Alexandrian text-type]].

The Byzantine text is also found in a few modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as standard Byzantine text.

The Byzantine textform is often marked with the abbreviations &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}&lt;/math&gt; or '''Byz'''.

== Manuscripts of the Byzantine text ==

[[File:Codex alexandrinus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Codex Alexandrinus''', the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the Gospels, close to the Family Π (''Luke 12:54-13:4'')]]

For some time following the fourth century different types of text were current in the East, but at the end the Byzantine text "almost wholly displaced the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort. ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'', 1925. p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine text-type has by far the largest number of surviving manuscripts, many of them written in the newer [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower case) style and in [[Polytonic orthography]] handwriting, which had been invented in the 3rd century BC by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] but which took many centuries to catch on outside scholarly circles. For example, of 522 complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the [[General epistles|General Epistles]] collated by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in [[Münster]], [[Germany]], 372 of them attest the Byzantine reading in at least 90% of 98 test places. Amongst the earliest surviving manuscripts, the position is reversed. There are six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (the oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament being Alexandrian. By comparison, the [[Alexandrian text-type]] is witnessed by nine surviving [[uncials]] earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be demonstrated in three earlier [[papyrus|papyri]]. Modern critical editions of the New Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses — especially [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]].

The earliest [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] to witness to a Byzantine text-type in substantial New Testament quotations is [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 349 — 407); although the fragmentary surviving works of [[Asterius the Sophist]] († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Fee, "The Use of Greek Patristic Citations in New Testament Textual Criticism: The State of the Question," pp. 344-359 in ''Studies in the Theory and Method of New Testament Textual Criticism'' (ed. Eldon J. Epp and Gordon D. Fee; Studies &amp; Documents 45; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and the incomplete surviving translation of [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] (d. 383) into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William, 1980, ''An Introduction to the Gothic Language'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysostom and Asterius used text only in 75% agreed with the standard Byzantine text. The second earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac [[Peshitta]] (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations |year=1977 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=0-19-826170-5 |pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the [[Garima Gospels]] and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as "early Byzantine". Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with [[Papyrus 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Zuurmond |first1=Rochus |last2=Niccum |first2=Curt |title="The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament" in Bart D. Ehrman and Michael W. Holmes eds "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn|year=2013|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-23604-2|pages= 231–252}}"One would say that the Ethiopian ''Versio Antiqua'' is basically a Byzantine text, with some Western elements and some remnants of the early Egyptian text.  For lack of a better term one could coin this "early Byzantine".&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the Byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole, and sometimes differs from a Byzantine sub-group of manuscripts that proliferated after the 11th century. Amongst the bulk of later manuscripts however, it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear Byzantine majority reading for each variant; and a Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings — "The Majority Text" — has been produced by [[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript.

== Characteristics of the Byzantine text ==
{{see also|List of major textual variants in the New Testament}}

Compared to [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts, the distinct Byzantine readings tend to show a greater tendency toward smooth and well-formed Greek, they display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel [[Synoptic Gospel]] passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or "[[Lectio difficilior potior|difficult]]" issues of [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Syrian text has all the appearance of being a careful attempt to supersede the chaos of rival texts by a judicious selection from them all." [[Brooke Foss Westcott]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]. ''The New Testament In The Original Greek'', 1925. p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 1:2 reads "As it is written in the prophets..." in the Byzantine text; whereas the same verse reads, "As it is written in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] the prophet..." in all other early textual witnesses. Since the quotation introduced is partly from [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], the Byzantine form of the verse avoids the difficulty that might be adduced were it to be concluded that Mark was presenting a factual inaccuracy.

Another characteristic is the grammar (e.g., οι δε ειπον; in Alexandrian text: οι δε ειπαν) and the different order of words. For example:

John 6:49

: εν τη ερημω το μαννα – codices [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|B]], [[Codex Ephraemi|C]], [[Codex Bezae|D]], T, [[Codex Washingtonianus|W]], [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]]
: το μαννα εν τη ερημω – codices [[Codex Sinaiticus|ﬡ]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|A]], [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|L]], [[Codex Athous Lavrentis|Ψ]], [[Family 1|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Family 13|''f''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]], mss. of the Byzantine text-type

Mark 1:9

: εις τον Ιορδανην υπο Ιωανου – codices ﬡ, B, D
: υπο Ιωανου εις τον Ιορδανην – codices A, W, and manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type

Also, the Byzantine text does not contain verses included by Textus Receptus: Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34.

There are no consistent Byzantine witnesses amongst the early New Testament [[papyri (chronology)|papyri]]. Nevertheless, instances of distinctive Byzantine readings are not unusual in the earliest texts — even though they otherwise conform more to other text-types or none. Hence, many (and possibly most) distinctive Byzantine readings are likely to be early in date. Two broad explanations have been offered for this observation:

* that the Byzantine text-type transmits a text closest to the primary form of the New Testament books; whose early manuscript witnesses have not survived, as this text-type predominated in regions where the climate did not favour the preservation of papyrus;
* that the Byzantine text represents a consistent exercise in textual compilation and correction from around the 4th century, the editors having eclectically selected those readings from a range of early manuscripts, that best conformed to their presupposed standards of the characteristics to be expected in the New Testament text.

=== Special cases ===

In Mark 6:33 and Luke 24:53 the Byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Western text. In other cases the situation is more complicated. Mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Caesarean text.

== Origin of the Byzantine text ==

In order to displace the [[Textus Receptus]] (see the following section) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the Greek New Testament, later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the Byzantine text which formed its base. This [[Westcott-Hort|Wescott and Hort]]'s Introduction accomplished in masterful detail (over the course of 600 pages) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part.

They summarize the problem early on in their work (p.&amp;nbsp;45) as follows:
"A theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa." In the discussion that follows, they reason that the "incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work" in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that "every ground for expecting 'a priori' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westcotthort.com/books/Westcott_Hort_-_Introduction_to_the_New_Testament_in_the_Original_Greek_(2nd_1896).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those modern scholars who believe that the Byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs, there is some debate concerning the origin of the Byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use. The suggestions that have been put forward are:

* That [[Lucian of Antioch]] used his [[Textual criticism|text critical]] skills to produce a [[recension]]. ([[Jerome]] makes reference to Lucian's recension of the Old Testament only. Wescott and Hort favored this theory.)
* That [[Constantine I]] paid for the wide distribution of manuscripts which came from a common source. (There are several references by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to Constantine paying for [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|manuscript production]]).
* That after the [[Western Roman Empire]] stopped using Greek, and because of [[Barbarian]] and [[Muslim]] invasions, eliminating the possibility for either [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] or [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]] to exercise any further influence on the text of the Greek New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

(See also [[State church of the Roman Empire]].)

The standard Byzantine text used by the Eastern, Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century. However, some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here. The early Byzantine text is near to the Alexandrian text in that it differs from the late Byzantine text in roughly 3000 places. Kurt Aland did not consider early Byzantine families such as E and Π to be classified as Byzantine manuscripts. He placed some of them into Category III of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. Aland placed all manuscripts with standard Byzantine text into Category V.

== The Textus Receptus ==

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [[Erasmus]] and published by [[Johann Froben]] of Basel on March 1, 1516 ([[Novum Instrumentum omne]]). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglot]], Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he back-translated from the Latin [[Vulgate]], and Erasmus also introduced many readings from the Vulgate and [[Church Fathers]]. This text came to be known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' or ''received text'' after being thus termed by [[Bonaventura Elzevir]], an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus' text. The New Testament of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the ''Textus Receptus''. The different Byzantine "Majority Text" of Hodges &amp; Farstad  as well as [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] &amp; Pierpont is called "Majority" because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. The Textus Receptus differs from the Majority Text in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent "translatable" differences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Marlowe states:[http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html] ''yet it differs from the Received Text in about a thousand places, most of them being trivial.'' while [[Daniel B. Wallace]] [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=673] ''has counted 1,838 differences between it and the Textus Receptus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern critical texts ==

[[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann|Karl Lachmann]] (1850) was the first New Testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the ''Textus Receptus'', relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. Although the majority of New Testament textual critics now favor a text that is [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] in complexion, especially after the publication of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]]'s [[Westcott-Hort|edition]], there remain some proponents of the Byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs. These critics include the editors of the Hodges and Farstad text (cited below), and the [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] and Pierpont text. Depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the Alexandrian text-type, then this will differ from the Hodges and Farstad text in around 6,500 readings (Wallace 1989).

To give a feel for the difference between the Byzantine form of text and the [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] text, which is mainly Alexandrian in character, of 800 variation units in the [[Epistle of James]] collected by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], the Byzantine and Eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places (a rate of 92.3%). Many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in English versions. According to the preface to the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible, the [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Alexandrian text-type]] and the Byzantine text-type are 85% identical (that is, of the variations that occur in any manuscript, only 15% actually differ between these three).

The Byzantine type is also found in modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John's gospel, (funded by the [[United Bible Societies]] in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in [[Birmingham]], UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, ''The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-According-John-Byzantine-Tradition/dp/1598563076|title=The Gospel According to John in The Byzantine Tradition|author=|editor-first1=Roderic L.|editor-last1=Mullen|editor-first2=Simon|editor-last2=Crisp|editor-first3=D. C.|editor-last3=Parker|date=14 July 2008|publisher=Hendrickson Pub|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:

* K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, hundreds of minuscules, among them codex [[Minuscule 2|2]], [[Minuscule 3|3]], [[Minuscule 8|8]], 14, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 73, 75, 76, 78, etc.
* K&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, no early minuscules, hundreds of minuscules: 18, 35, 55, 66, 83, 128, 141, 147, 155, 167, 170, 189, 201
* K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (subfamily of K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;) — S V Ω 461
* K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (Family E) — [[Codex Basilensis A. N. III. 12|E]] [[Codex Boreelianus|F]] [[Codex Seidelianus I|G]] [[Codex Seidelianus II|H]]
* I&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (also K&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), now Family Π — (A) K Y Π; this subgroup is the oldest, but only 5% of manuscripts belong to it. Majority of them have text mixed with other Byzantine subfamilies.

Since the discovery of the [[Papyrus 45]], [[Papyrus 46]], and [[Papyrus 66]], proof is available that occasionally the Byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness. Examples:

Other examples of Byzantine readings were found in p&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14.51; 5:8; 6:10.57; 7:3.39; 8:41.51.55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; 14:17. This supports the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and [[Maurice A. Robinson|Maurice Robinson]] (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date. (In 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.)&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''Chapters in the History of New Testament Textual Criticism'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids 1963, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of Textus Receptus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''Dean Burgon in the Light of Recent Research''; D. A. Waite, ''Defending the King James Bible'', Bible For Today, Collingswood, New Jersey 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wallace, ''The Majority Text Theory: History, Methods, and Critique'', in Studies &amp; Documents 1995, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cautelary jurisprudence''' is [[law]] made in a precautionary way prior to or outside of the normal [[Legislature|legislative enactment]]. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular [[jurisprudence]] which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall.&lt;ref&gt;Tuori, Kaius. ''Ancient Roman Lawyers and Modern Legal Ideals: Studies on the Impact of Contemporary Concerns in the Interpretation of Ancient Roman Legal History'' Vittorio Klostermann: 2007 {{ISBN|3-465-04034-1}} {{ISBN|9783465040347}}; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Its first proponent was [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex]], who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the ''[[cautio muciana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary law is a tentative "procedure" used by [[lawyers]]. Initially, in [[Ancient Rome]], the idea of [[inheritance]] as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With ''cautio muciana'' it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the ''[[legatee]]s'', a "negative authority" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the ''[[legator]]''. It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The legatee provides a [[stipulatio]] or ''cautio'', promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, "I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married."

The ''cautio muciana'' is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with [[inheritance law]] and the administration of [[trusts]]. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or [[judge]]s. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20501">In digital imaging systems, '''color management''' is the controlled [[Data conversion|conversion]] between the [[color]] representations of various devices, such as [[image scanner]]s, [[digital camera]]s, monitors, TV screens, film printers, [[computer printer]]s, offset presses, and corresponding media.

The primary goal of color management is to obtain a good match across color devices; for example, the colors of one frame of a video should appear the same on a computer [[LCD|LCD monitor]], on a plasma TV screen, and as a printed poster. Color management helps to achieve the same appearance on all of these devices, provided the devices are capable of delivering the needed color intensities. With photography it is often critical that prints or online gallery appear how they were intended. Color management cannot guarantee identical color reproduction, as this is rarely possible, but it can at least give more control over any changes which may occur.&lt;ref name=cambridgeincolour.com /&gt;

Parts of this technology are implemented in the [[operating system]] (OS), helper libraries, the application, and devices. A cross-platform view of color management is the use of an ICC-compatible color management system. The [[International Color Consortium]] (ICC) is an industry consortium that has defined:

* An open standard for a ''Color Matching Module'' (CMM) at the OS level
* [[ICC profile|color profiles]] for:
** Devices, including devicelink-profiles that represent a complete color transformation from source device to target device
** ''Working spaces'', the color spaces in which color data is meant to be manipulated

There are other approaches to color management besides using [[ICC profile]]s. This is partly due to history and partly because of other needs than the ICC standard covers. The film and broadcasting industries make use of some of the same concepts, but they frequently rely on more limited boutique solutions. The film industry, for instance, often uses [[3D LUT]]s ([[lookup table]]) to represent a complete color transformation for a specific RGB encoding. At the consumer level, color management currently applies more to still images than video, in which color management is still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Overview ==
#  Characterize. Every color-managed device requires a personalized table, or "color profile," which characterizes the color response of that particular device.
#  Standardize. Each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors (the "Profile Connection Space").
#  Translate. Color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another. This is usually performed by a color management module (CMM).&lt;ref&gt;Overview of Color Management,Camberidge in Colour,2016.1.23 http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-management1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==

=== Characterization ===
{{see also|ICC profile}}
To describe the behavior of various output devices, they must be compared (measured) in relation to a standard [[color space]]. Often a step called linearization is performed first, to undo the effect of [[gamma correction]] that was done to get the most out of limited [[8-bit color]] paths. Instruments used for measuring device colors include [[Tristimulus colorimeter|colorimeter]]s and [[spectrophotometer]]s. As an intermediate result, the device [[gamut]] is described in the form of scattered measurement data.  The transformation of the scattered measurement data into a more regular form, usable by the application, is called ''profiling''. Profiling is a complex process involving mathematics, intense computation, judgment, testing, and iteration. After the profiling is finished, an idealized color description of the device is created. This description is called a ''profile''.

===Calibration===
{{main|Color calibration}}
Calibration is like characterization, except that it can include the adjustment of the device, as opposed to just the measurement of the device.  Color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as [[sRGB]]; when such calibration is done well enough, no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently.  This avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of sRGB.

==Color profiles==
[[File:CTPgifsm.gif|thumbnail|right|A 3D view of two ICC profiles]]

=== Embedding ===
Image formats themselves (such as [[TIFF]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]) may contain embedded [[ICC Profile|color profiles]] but are not required to do so by the image format. The [[International Color Consortium]] standard was created to bring various developers and manufacturers together. The ICC standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of [[metadata]]. This allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory.

=== Working spaces ===
Working spaces, such as [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]] or [[ProPhoto]] are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing. For instance, pixels with equal values of R,G,B should appear neutral. Using a large (gamut) working space will lead to [[posterization]], while using a small working space will lead to [[clipping (photography)|clipping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Rodney|title=The role of working spaces in Adobe applications|url=http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_colspace.pdf|publisher=Adobe|series=Technical Paper|accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade-off is a consideration for the critical image editor.

==Color transformation==
Color transformation, or color space conversion, is the transformation of the representation of a color from one [[color space]] to another. This calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color-managed chain and carried out by a [[Color management#Color management module|Color Matching Module]]. Transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space. It makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device. By ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see, this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices. Color transformations can be represented by two profiles (source profile and target profile) or by a devicelink profile. In this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed.&lt;ref name="cambridgeincolour.com"&gt;http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-space-conversion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Profile connection space ===
In the terminology of the [[International Color Consortium]], a translation between two color spaces can go through a ''profile connection space'' (PCS): Color Space 1 → PCS ([[CIELAB]] or [[CIEXYZ]]) → Color space 2; conversions into and out of the PCS are each specified by a profile.&lt;ref name=rodney&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andrew|last=Rodney|title=Color Management for Photographers|year=2005|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|isbn=0-240-80649-2|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gamut mapping ===
In nearly every translation process, we have to deal with the fact that the color [[gamut]] of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible.&lt;ref name="cambridgeincolour.com"/&gt; They therefore need some rearrangement near the borders of the gamut. Some colors must be shifted to the inside of the gamut, as they otherwise cannot be represented on the output device and would simply be clipped. This so-called gamut mismatch occurs for example, when we translate from the RGB color space with a wider gamut into the CMYK color space with a narrower gamut range. In this example, the dark highly saturated purplish-blue color of a typical computer monitor's "blue" primary is impossible to print on paper with a typical [[CMYK]] printer. The nearest approximation within the printer's gamut will be much less saturated. Conversely, an inkjet printer's "cyan" primary, a saturated mid-brightness blue, is outside the gamut of a typical computer monitor. The color management system can utilize various methods to achieve desired results and give experienced users control of the gamut mapping behavior.

====Rendering intent====
When the gamut of source color space exceeds that of the destination, saturated colors are liable to become [[clipping (photography)|clipped]] (inaccurately represented), or more formally [[Burned (image)|burned]]. The color management module can deal with this problem in several ways. The ICC specification includes four different rendering intents, listed below.&lt;ref name=rodney/&gt;&lt;ref name="cic"&gt;[http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-space-conversion.htm Color Management: Color Space Conversion], Cambridge in Color&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf ICC Specification ICC.1:2010&lt;/ref&gt; Before the actual rendering intent is carried out, one can temporarily simulate the rendering by [[soft proofing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/soft-proofing.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is a useful tool as it predicts the outcome of the colors and is available as an application in many color management systems:

* '''Absolute colorimetric''' :
Absolute colorimetry and relative colorimetry actually use the same table but differ in the adjustment for the white point media.  If the output device has a much larger gamut than the source profile, i.e., all the colors in the source can be represented in the output, using the absolute colorimetry rendering intent would ideally (ignoring noise, precision, etc.) give an exact output of the specified CIELAB values.  Perceptually, the colors may appear incorrect, but instrument measurements of the resulting output would match the source. Colors outside of the proof print system's possible color are mapped to the boundary of the color gamut.

Absolute colorimetry is useful to get an exact specified color (e.g., IBM blue), or to quantify the accuracy of mapping methods.

* '''Relative colorimetric''' :
The goal in relative colorimetry is to be truthful to the specified color, with only a correction for the media. Relative colorimetry is useful in proofing applications, since it can be used to get an idea of how a print on one device will appear on a different device.  Media differences are the only thing that one really should adjust for, although some gamut mapping also needs to be applied. Usually this is done in a way where hue and lightness are maintained at the cost of reduced saturation.

Relative colorimetric is the default rendering intent on most systems.

* '''Perceptual''' and '''Saturation''' :
The perceptual and saturation intents are where the results really depend upon the profile maker. This is even how some of the competitors in this market differentiate themselves.  These intents should be created by the profile maker so that pleasing images occur with the perceptual intent while eye-catching business graphics occur with the saturation intent.  This is achieved through the use of different perceptual remaps of the data as well as different gamut mapping methods.

Perceptual rendering is recommended for color separation.

In practice, photographers almost always use relative or perceptual intent, as for natural images, absolute causes [[color cast]], while saturation produces unnatural colors.&lt;ref name="cic" /&gt; Relative intent handles out-of-gamut by clipping (burning) these colors to the edge of the gamut, leaving in-gamut colors unchanged, while perceptual intent smoothly moves out-of-gamut colors into gamut, preserving gradations, but distorts in-gamut colors in the process. If an entire image is in-gamut, relative is perfect, but when there are out of gamut colors, which is more preferable depends on a case-by-case basis.

Saturation intent is most useful in charts and diagrams, where there is a discrete palette of colors that the designer wants saturated to make them intense, but where specific hue is less important.

== Implementation ==

===Color management module===
''Color matching module'' (also -''method'' or -''system'') is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent. The key issue here is how to deal with a color that cannot be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color, just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different. There is no common method for this process, and the performance depends on the capability of each color matching method.

Some well known CMMs are [[ColorSync]], Adobe CMM, [[LittleCMS]], and ArgyllCMS.

===Operating system level===
[[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]] operating systems have provided OS-level color management APIs since 1993, through [[ColorSync]].  macOS has added automatic color management (assuming sRGB for most things) automatically in the OS, and applications have to work around this to provide more accurate color management.

Since 1997 color management in Windows is available through an ICC color management system (ICM). Beginning with [[Windows Vista]], [[Microsoft]] introduced a new color architecture known as [[Windows Color System]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Steve (February 2008). [http://www.colorwiki.com/wiki/Vista%27s_New_Color_Management_System_-_WCS Vista's New Color Management System: WCS].&lt;/ref&gt; WCS supplements the ''Image Color Management'' (ICM) system in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, originally written by [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Licenses LinoColorCMM Technology To Improve Color Management in Windows|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/apr97/linopr.mspx|date=1997-04-23|accessdate=2008-05-08|author=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The reader may verify this by examining the ''Properties'' of any ICM profile. The ''Profile Information'' tab should contain the entry "LinoColorCMM © by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG".&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating systems that use the [[X Window System]] for graphics can use [[ICC profile]]s, and support for [[Linux color management|color management on Linux]], still less mature than on other platforms, is coordinated through OpenICC at [[freedesktop.org]] and makes use of [[LittleCMS]].

===File level===
Certain image filetypes ([[TIFF]] and [[Photoshop]]) include the notion of [[color channels]] for specifying the ''color mode'' of the file. The most commonly used channels are [[RGB]] (mainly for display (monitors) but also for some desktop printing) and [[CMYK]] (for commercial printing). An additional [[Channel (digital image)#Alpha channel|''alpha'' channel]] may specify a transparency mask value. Some image software (such as [[Photoshop]]) perform automatic [[color separation]] to maintain color information in CMYK mode using a specified [[ICC profile]] such as '''US Web Coated (SWOP) v2'''.

===Application level===
{{As of|2005}}, most [[web browser]]s ignored color profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Colin |author2=Kabili, Jan |title=How to Wow: Photoshop CS2 for the Web|publisher=Peachpit Press |location=Berkeley, CA |year=2005 |pages=13 |isbn=0-321-39394-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1H0fNcAPHcC&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=web+browsers+ignore+%22icc+profiles%22 |doi= |accessdate=2008-05-08|quote=Many designers choose not to include ICC Profiles with Web files because most Web browsers can't read them and they increase the size of a file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable exceptions were [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], starting with version 2.0, and [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] starting with version 3. Although disabled by default in Firefox 3.0, ICC v2 and ICC v4 color management could be enable by using an add-on&lt;ref&gt;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/color-management/ Color Management add-on] by Sean Hayes.&lt;/ref&gt; or setting a configuration option.&lt;ref&gt;The value &lt;code&gt;gfx.color_management.enabled&lt;/code&gt; can be set to "true" in the "[[about: URI scheme|about:config]]" file of Firefox since version 3.

{{update|section|date=August 2012}}
{{As of|2012}}{{when|date=August 2012}}, notable browser support for color management is:
* Firefox: from version 3.5 enabled by default for ICC v2 tagged images,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=463221]&lt;/ref&gt; version 8.0 has ICC v4 profiles support,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679371]&lt;/ref&gt; but it needs to be activated manually.&lt;ref&gt;http://cameratico.com/guides/firefox-color-management/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Internet Explorer: version 9 is the first Microsoft browser to partly support ICC profiles, but it does not render images correctly according to the Windows ICC settings (it only converts non-sRGB images to the sRGB profile) and therefore provides no real color management at all{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* [[Google Chrome]]: uses the system provided ICC v2 and v4 support on [[macOS]], and from version 22 supports ICC v2 profiles by default on other platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=143 Issue 143: Handle color profiles in tagged images]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Safari: has support starting with version 2.0{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* Opera: has support since 12.10&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/unified/1210/ Opera Changelog 12.10 stable&lt;/ref&gt; for ICC v4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121004234405/http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/whats-new-in-opera-12-10-beta What's new in Opera 12.10 beta]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], an author uses '''contrast''' when he or she describes the difference(s) between two or more entities. For example, in the first four lines of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Sonnet 130]]'', Shakespeare contrasts a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.

Contrast is the antonym of [[simile]]. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, [[John Donne]] and the [[metaphysical poetry|metaphysical poets]] developed the [[conceit]] as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In [[Renaissance]] poetry, and particularly in [[sonnet]]s, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of ''my love is unlike all other women'' or ''I am unlike her other loves''.

In the early 18th century, a theory of [[wit]] developed by English writers (particularly [[John Locke]]) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In [[lyric poetry]], the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.

'''Corrected Flow''' is the mass flow that would pass through a device (e.g. compressor, bypass duct, etc.) if the inlet pressure and temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (e.g. 101.325 kPa, 300K).

Corrected Flow, '''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;''', can be calculated as follows, assuming Imperial Units:

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} = w\sqrt{T/518.7}/(P/14.696)&lt;/math&gt;'''

Corrected Flow is often given the symbol '''&lt;math&gt;wc&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''&lt;math&gt;wr&lt;/math&gt;''' (for referred flow).

So-called Non-Dimensional Flow, '''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}&lt;/math&gt;''', is proportional to Corrected Flow:

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}= w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} * \sqrt{518.7}/{14.696}&lt;/math&gt;'''

The equivalent equations for Preferred SI Units are: (101.325kPa, 288.15K)

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} = w\sqrt{T/288.15}/(P/101.325)&lt;/math&gt;'''

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}= w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} * \sqrt{288.15}/{101.325}&lt;/math&gt;'''

Nomenclature:

*'''&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''' Stagnation (or Total) Pressure (in kPa)
*'''&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' Stagnation (or Total) Temperature (in K)
*'''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''' Real Mass Flow
*'''&lt;math&gt;{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;''' Referred Pressure
*'''&lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;''' Referred Temperature

In relative form, Corrected Flow, Referred Flow and Non-Dimensional Flow are all measures of axial Mach number.

Side note:
If the mass flow can be considered an energy source such as fuel flow, the corrected flow is calculated as follows:

'''&lt;math&gt; w/(\delta * \sqrt{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;'''

Note: 

The source of coefficients is coming out from the fact that rotating components will in fact change the fluid properties, because of vibrations (compressibility of the flow change). 
So if one wants to correct the fuel flow then a theta correction exponent should be found through iterations, but for corrections for flow at engine entry (W2) then this aspect on rotating components vibration is not accounted because much smaller than one inside an engine. As a consequence the inlet flow is corrected just by square root of Theta and divided by delta.

== Overview ==
The Experimental Station marked its 100th anniversary in 2003. It was founded as an effort to move the DuPont Company from [[gunpowder]] and [[explosives]] into the new age of [[chemistry]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The site overlooks the original powder mills upon which the company was founded - now [[Hagley Museum and Library]], a nonprofit educational institution documenting the history of DuPont business and technology. The Experimental Station is east from Hagley Museum and west-southwest from the [[Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]].

As one of the first industrial research laboratories in the United States, the {{convert|150|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus-style Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, serves as the primary research and development facility for DuPont. It is home to DuPont's [[Central Research]] and most other business units of DuPont are also represented on site. The Experimental Station is the birthplace of many of the innovative materials and products developed by DuPont since 1903, including:

* [[Neoprene]] - the world's first [[synthetic rubber]];
* [[Nylon]] polyamide for [[fiber]]s and engineering polymers for machine parts, gears, electrical systems and even [[automobile]] air intake manifolds;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html History of Nylon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621045155/http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html |date=2008-06-21 }} US Patent 2,130,523 'Linear polyamides suitable for spinning into strong pliable fibers', U.S. Patent 2,130,947 'Diamine dicarboxylic acid salt' issued and U.S. Patent 2,130,948 'Synthetic fibers', all issued 20 September 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

For a more complete description of the inventions of the scientists and engineers of the Experimental Station, see the [[List of DuPont Experimental Station Inventions]].  

Today nearly 2,000 scientists and researchers - including roughly 600 with [[Ph.D.]]s - pursue new opportunities for a broad range of global markets including [[agriculture]] and [[nutrition]], [[electronics]], safety and protection, [[coatings]] and performance materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Science/en_US/rd/station/index.html DuPont.com: Experimental Station&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 50 buildings encompassing 250,000 square meters of research space.

Research and development now under way includes [[nanotechnology]], emerging [[video display]] technologies, [[fuel cells]], and [[biomaterials]] produced from [[renewable resources]] such as [[maize|corn]]. These developments could lead to foods that help prevent diseases and brittle bones, "smart" materials that can adjust performance on their own, microorganisms that produce [[biodegradable]] products and innovative materials for personal protection.

On the morning of January 24, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] became the first president to visit the Experimental Station.&lt;ref&gt;For more about Bush's visit and his speech on energy, see https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-5.html&lt;/ref&gt; He saw examples of how DuPont is putting science to work to provide products for agricultural [[energy crop]]s, feedstock processing and advanced [[biofuels]] such as [[ethanol]] and bio-[[butanol]]. He also viewed other [[alternative energy]] sources and technologies dealing with [[energy conservation]]. These are all part of DuPont’s sustainable growth mission.

In [[music]], the '''dynamics''' of a piece is the variation in [[loudness]] between [[note (music)|notes]] or [[phrase (music)|phrases]]. Dynamics are indicated by specific [[musical notation]], often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a ''piano'' (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in [[timbre]] and sometimes [[tempo rubato]].
==Purpose and interpretation==
Dynamics are one of the [[musical expression|expressive elements of music]]. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiemel|first1=Matthias|title=Dynamics|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08458|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2017|ref=Grove Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{serif|'''''p'''''}} never indicates a precise level of [[loudness]], it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than {{serif|'''''f'''''}}. There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a [[phrase (music theory)|musical phrase]] will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked {{serif|'''''p'''''}} throughout.  Similarly, in [[polyphony|multi-part music]], some [[part (music)|voices]] will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a [[tuba]] playing ''piano'' will likely be louder than a [[guitar]] playing ''fortissimo'', while a high-pitched instrument like the [[piccolo]] playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

Further, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A ''forte'' passage is not usually "the same as a ''piano'' passage but louder". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like [[timbre]] or [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to [[tempo]]. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed "don't speed up just because it's getting louder!". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.{{efn|For instance, in Schubert's string quartet ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', the ''dimenuendo'' marking is followed by ''[[a tempo]]'', indicating that the dimenuendo is a reduction in speed as well as in loudness. In the same work Schubert uses ''decrescendo'' to indicate a reduction in loudness with no change in speed.}}

In some [[scorewriter|music notation program]]s, there are default [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's [[Logic Pro]] 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:
* {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or ''piano'', meaning "soft".&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite book |first=Don Michael |last=Randel |authorlink=Don Michael Randel |publisher=Harvard University Press Reference Library |location=Cambridge, MA, US |year=2003 |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vtp"&gt;{{cite web | title=Piano  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textp/Piano.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* {{serif|'''''mp'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-piano'',  meaning "half soft".
* {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-forte'',  meaning "half loud".&lt;ref name="vtd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Dynamics.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'', standing for ''più piano'' and meaning "softer".
* ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', standing for ''più forte'' and meaning "louder".

Use of up to three consecutive {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s or {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s is also common:
* {{serif|'''''pp'''''}}, standing for ''pianissimo'' and meaning "very soft".
* {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}, standing for ''fortissimo'' and meaning "very loud".
* {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, standing for ''pianississimo'' and meaning "more than very soft".
* {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, standing for ''fortississimo'' and meaning "more than very loud".&lt;ref name="vtd" /&gt;

===Changes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Abrupt changes|Gradual changes}}
{{redirect-multi|2|Crescendo|Diminuendo}}

[[Image:Dynamic's Note Velocity.svg|thumb|350px|Note Velocity is a [[MIDI]] measurement of the speed that the key travels from its rest position to completely depressed, with 127, the largest value in a 7-bit number, being instantaneous, and meaning as strong as possible. {{audio|MIDI dynamics fff to ppp.mid|Play a C major chord at each dynamic from fff to ppp}}]]

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* '''''crescendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|cresc.}}'') translates as "increasing" (literally "growing").
* '''''decrescendo''''' (abbreviated to ''{{serif|decresc.}}'') translates as "decreasing".
* '''''diminuendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|dim.}}'') translates as "diminishing".

Signs sometimes referred to as "[[hairpin]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (1996), entry "Hairpins".&lt;/ref&gt; are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up ([[File:Music-crescendo.svg|15x15px]]), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually ([[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|15x15px]]), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #2.5
        a4._\mf\&lt; gis16 a\! c4.\&gt; b8\! a4
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

Hairpins are usually written below the [[staff (music)|staff]] (or between the two staves in a [[grand staff]]), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for [[singer]]s or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few [[bar (music)|bars]]), while ''{{serif|cresc.}}'', ''{{serif|decresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|dim.}}'' are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word ''morendo'' ("dying") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).

For greater changes in dynamics, ''{{serif|cresc. molto}}'' and ''{{serif|dim. molto}}'' are often used, where the ''molto'' means "much". Similarly, for more gradual changes ''{{serif|poco cresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|poco dim.}}'' are used, where "poco" translates as ''a little'', or alternatively with ''poco a poco'' meaning "little by little''.

Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word ''subito'' (meaning "suddenly") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. ''Subito piano (''abbreviated ''{{serif| sub. '''p'''}}'') ("suddenly soft") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the {{serif|'''''p'''''}} range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the ''piano'' {{serif|'''''p'''''}} dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.

{{anchor|Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes}}
[[Accent (music)|Accented notes]] can be notated  ''sforzando'', ''sforzato'', ''forzando'' or ''forzato'' (abbreviated {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}) ("forcing" or "forced"), or using the sign '''&gt;''', placed above or below the head of the note.

''Sforzando'' (or ''sforzato'', ''forzando'', ''forzato'') indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}} or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}. There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerou |first=Tom |first2=Linda |last2= Lusk |title= Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation |year=1996 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |location= Van Nuys, CA |isbn= 978-0882847306 |pages=37–38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=sf+sfz+fz#v=onepage&amp;q=sf%20sfz%20fz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the ''sforzando'' is determined purely by the performer.

The [[fortepiano (musical dynamic)|fortepiano]] notation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}} indicates a ''forte'' followed immediately by ''piano''. By contrast, {{serif|'''''pf'''''}} is an abbreviation for ''poco forte'', literally "a little loud" but (according to Brahms) meaning ''with the character of forte, but the sound of piano'', though rarely used because of possible confusion with ''[[#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|pianoforte]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreysolow.com/Writings/AnEnigmaticMarkingExplainedVcS.doc An Enigmatic Marking Explained], by Jeffrey Solow, Violoncello Society Newsletter, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While the typical range of dynamic  markings is from {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the [[orchestration]] of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

In [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} occurs twice in "Mars" and once in "Uranus", often punctuated by organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP05396-Holst_-_THE_PLANETS_-_Suite_for_Large_Orchestra_-_Partitur.pdf|title=The Planets|last=Holst|first=Gustav|publisher=Goodwin &amp; Tabb|year=1921|isbn=|location=London|pages=29, 42, 159|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] marks a bassoon solo {{serif|'''''pppppp'''''}} (6 {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s) in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Pathétique'' Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b5/IMSLP504312-PMLP2511-Tchaikovsky_-_Symphony_No.6_in_B_minor,_Op.74;_TH_30;_CW_27,_'Pathetic'.pdf|title=Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in Full Score|last=Tchaikovsky|first=Peter Ilyitch|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1979|isbn=048623861X|location=New York|page=First movement, just before Allegro vivo|nopp=y|oclc=6414366}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} in passages of his ''[[1812 Overture]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/f1/IMSLP01078-Tchaikovsky_-_1812_Overture.pdf|title=P.I.

==History==
''On Music'', one of the ''[[Moralia]]'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plutarch]] in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does [[rhythm]] or [[harmony]].

The [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[composer]] [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] was one of the first to indicate dynamics in [[music notation]], but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used some dynamic terms, including ''forte'', ''piano'', ''più piano'', and ''pianissimo'' (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} was considered to mean ''pianissimo'' in this period.

The fact that the [[harpsichord]] could play only "terraced" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the "somewhat misleading suggestion that [[Baroque music|baroque]] dynamics are 'terraced dynamics'," writes [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Donington|Donington, Robert]]: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote that "Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft."&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the [[harpsichord]] in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.

In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] specified six levels ({{serif|'''''pp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] used also {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}} (the latter less frequently), and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40)]], he uses the expressions {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, ''molto piano'', and ''[[quasi niente]]'' to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'' and ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', making for a total of ten levels between {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. [[Dynamic range compression]] is used to control the [[Dynamic range#Music|dynamic range]] of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Audio|last=Katz|first=Robert|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=0-240-80545-3|location=Amsterdam: Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and macro scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/dynamic-range-loudness-war|title='Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War|last=Deruty|first=Emmanuel|date=September 2011|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=2018-01-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, the meaning of the term ''dynamics'' is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term ''performed dynamics'' can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elowsson|first=Anders|last2=Friberg|first2=Anders|date=|title=Predicting the perception of performed dynamics in music audio with ensemble learning|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/4106.pdf|journal=The Acoustical Society of America|volume=141 |issue=3|pages=2224–2242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''endosperm''' is a tissue produced inside the [[seed]]s of most of the [[flowering plant]]s following fertilization. It surrounds the [[embryo]] and provides nutrition in the form of [[starch]], though it can also contain [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s and [[protein]]. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in animal diet. For example, [[wheat]] endosperm is ground into flour for [[bread]] (the rest of the grain is included as well in [[whole wheat flour]]), while [[barley]] endosperm is the main source of sugars for [[beer]] production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are [[coconut]] "meat" and coconut "water",&lt;ref&gt;[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph10.htm retrieved 14 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maize|corn]]. Some plants, such as [[orchid]]s, lack endosperm in their [[seed]]s.

==Origin of endosperm==

Ancestral flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and abundant endosperm, and the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with mature seeds with little or no endosperm. In more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is non developed or consumed before the seed matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp#evolution |title=The Seed Biology Place - Seed Dormancy |publisher=Seedbiology.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman1998&gt;{{citation | author = Friedman, William E. | year = 1998 | title = The evolution of double fertilization and endosperm: an "historical" perspective | journal = Sexual Plant Reproduction | volume = 11 | page = 6 | doi = 10.1007/s004970050114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double fertilization===
Endosperm is formed when the two [[sperm|sperm nuclei]] inside a [[pollen]] grain reach the interior of a female gametophyte (sometimes called the [[ovule|embryo sac]]). One sperm nucleus fertilizes the [[egg cell]], forming a [[zygote]], while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the binucleate central cell, forming a primary endosperm cell (its nucleus is often called the ''triple fusion nucleus''). That cell created in the process of [[double fertilisation|double fertilization]] develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm constitutes an organism separate from the growing embryo.

About 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are [[polyploid]].&lt;ref name=Olsen2007&gt;{{citation | author = Olsen, By Odd-Arne| year = 2007 | title = Endosperm: Developmental and Molecular Biology | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFEA8Gg5_hAC|journal = | isbn = 9783540712350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically [[triploid]] (containing three sets of chromosomes), but can vary widely from [[diploid]] (2n) to 15n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/rEVIEWS/1026/figure/F1 |title=Figure 1 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-reviews1026 |publisher=genomebiology.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has been shown to have endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a pollen nucleus with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. The same is supposed for some other basal angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identification of diploid endosperm in an early angiosperm lineage |author=Williams J. H., Friedman W. E. |journal=Letters to Nature |volume=415 |issue=6871 |pages=522 |date=2002 |doi=10.1038/415522a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm lineages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{citation | last = Friedman | first =  William E. | year = 2003 | title = Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants| journal = Evolution| volume = 57| pages = 216–30| doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118867819/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 | pmid = 12683519 | last2 = Williams | first2 = JH | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endosperm formation===
There are three types of Endosperm development:

'''Nuclear endosperm formation''' - where repeated free-nuclear divisions take place; if a cell wall is formed it will form after free-nuclear divisions. Commonly referred to as liquid endosperm. Coconut water is an example of this.

'''Cellular endosperm formation''' - where a cell-wall formation is coincident with nuclear divisions. Coconut meat is cellular endosperm. Acoraceae has cellular endosperm development while other monocots are helobial.

'''Helobial endosperm formation''' - Where a cell wall is laid down between the first two nuclei, after which one half develops endosperm along the cellular pattern and the other half along the nuclear pattern.

== Evolutionary origins ==
The evolutionary origins of double fertilization and endosperm are unclear, attracting researcher attention for over a century. There are the two major hypotheses:&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/reviews/1026 Célia Baroux, Charles Spillane, Ueli Grossniklaus (2002)]. Evolutionary origins of the endosperm in flowering plants. Genome Biol. 3(9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The double fertilization initially used to produce two identical, independent embryos ("twins"). Later these embryos acquired different roles, one growing into the mature organism, and another merely supporting it. Thus the early endosperm was probably diploid, like the embryo. Some [[gymnosperms]], such as ''[[Ephedra (genus)]]'', may produce twin embryos by double fertilization. Either of these two embryos is capable of filling in the seed, but normally only one develops further (the other eventually aborts). Also, most basal angiosperms still contain the four-cell embryo sac and produce diploid endosperms.
* Endosperm is the evolutionary remnant of the actual [[gametophyte]], similar to the complex multicellular gametophytes found in gymnosperms. In this case, acquisition of the additional nucleus from the sperm cell is a later evolutionary step. This nucleus may provide the parental (not only maternal) organism with some control over endosperm development. Becoming triploid or polyploid are later evolutionary steps of this "primary gametophyte". Nonflowering seed plants (conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, Ephedra) form a large homozygous female gametophyte to nourish the embryo within a seed.&lt;ref&gt;[Friedman WE (1995)] Organismal duplication, inclusive fitness theory, and altruism: understanding the evolution of endosperm and the angiosperm reproductive syndrome. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 25;92(9):3913-7.{{PMID|11607532}}[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42072/pdf/pnas01493-0289.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of endosperm in seed development==
In some groups (e.g. grains of the family [[Poaceae]]) the endosperm persists to the mature seed stage as a storage tissue, in which case the seeds are called "albuminous" or "endospermous", and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g., most members of the family [[Fabaceae]], including the [[common bean]], ''Phaseolus vulgaris''), in which case the seeds are called "exalbuminous" or "cotyledonous" and the function of storage tissue is performed by enlarged [[cotyledons]] ("seed leaves"). In certain species (e.g. corn, ''Zea mays''); the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo.  Some mature endosperm tissue stores fats (e.g. [[castor bean]], ''Ricinus communis'') and others (including grains, such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches.

The dust-like seeds of [[orchid]]s have no endosperm. Orchid seedlings are [[mycoheterotrophy|mycoheterotrophic]] in their early development. In some other species, such as [[coffee]], the endosperm also does not develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Houk | first1 = W. G. | title = Endosperm and Perisperm of Coffee with Notes on the Morphology of the Ovule and Seed Development | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–61 | doi = 10.2307/2436631 | year = 1938 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2436631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the [[nucellus]] produces a nutritive tissue termed "perisperm". The endosperm of some species is responsible for [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mechanisms of plant growth and improved productivity: modern approaches edited by  Amarjit S. Basra 1994.
{{ISBN|0-8247-9192-4}} p.&lt;/ref&gt; Endosperm tissue also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo, it acts as a location for gene imprinting, and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents.&lt;ref name="Olsen2007"/&gt; In angiosperms, the endosperm contain hormones such as [[cytokinin]]s, which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic organ formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Pearson, Lorentz C. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The diversity and evolution of plants | year=1995 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton  | isbn=0-8493-2483-1 | page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cereal grains==
[[Cereal]] crops are grown for their edible [[fruit]] ([[cereal|grains]] or [[caryopsis|caryopses]]), which are primarily endosperm. In the caryopsis, the thin fruit wall is fused to the seed coat. Therefore, the nutritious part of the grain is the seed and its endosperm. In some cases (e.g. wheat, rice) the endosperm is selectively retained in food processing (commonly called white flour), and the embryo (germ) and seed coat (bran) removed. The processed grain has a lower quality of nutrition. Endosperm thus has an important role within the human diet worldwide.

The [[aleurone]] is the outer layer of endosperm cells, present in all small grains and retained in many dicots with transient endosperm. The cereal aleurone functions for both storage and digestion. During germination, it secretes the [[amylase]] enzyme that breaks down endosperm starch into sugars to nourish the growing seedling.&lt;ref&gt;Becraft, P.W., and Yi, G. (2011). Regulation of aleurone development in cereal grains. J Exp Bot 62, 1669-1675.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">'''Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough''' (1893–1965) was a [[scholar]] in the [[history of religion]]. He is specifically noted for his study of the influence of [[Greek culture]] on [[Judaism]], what some call [[Hellenistic Judaism]].

Born in [[Brooklyn]], he studied at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], [[Drew Theological Seminary]], and then received a bachelor's degree in [[theology]] from [[Garrett Biblical Institute]] in 1917.  He went on to [[Harvard University]] for three years, then three more years at [[Oxford University]], where he received the [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] degree in 1923.

He then began teaching at [[Yale University]] in 1923, where he taught until he retired in 1962. He went on [[Brandeis University]], then was given an office in the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard. He received honorary degrees from Yale, [[Hebrew Union College]], and the [[University of Uppsala]].

He edited the ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature]]'' from 1934-1942.

His papers are archived at Yale.  After his death, he was honored by a volume of studies in his honor, ''Religions in Antiquity: Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough'', edited by [[Jacob Neusner]], published by E.J. Brill in 1968 (reprinted by Wipf and Stock in 2004).

'''Etruscan art''' was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 350-351&lt;/ref&gt; 

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.  

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects. 

[[Bucchero]] wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery.  There was also a tradition of elaborate [[Etruscan vase painting]], which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].  Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta [[antefix]]es and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished.  Etruscan art was strongly connected to [[Etruscan religion|religion]]; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.&lt;ref name="etruscianartmusic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Etruscan Art |first=Nigel |last=Spivey|year=1997 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see|Etruscan history}}
The Etruscans emerged from the preceding [[Villanovan culture]]. Due to the proximity and/or commercial contact to Etruria, other ancient cultures influenced Etruscan art, such as [[Ancient Greek art|Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Middle East]]. &lt;!--   The apparent simple character in the [[Hellenistic]] era conceals an innovative and unique style whose pinnacle coincided with the [[Archaic period in Greece|Greek archaic period]]. ??? What, if anything, does this mean?--&gt; The Romans would later come to absorb the [[Etruscan society|Etruscan culture]] into theirs but would also be greatly influenced by them and their art.

===Periods===
[[File:A dancing man from the painted walls of the tomb of the Augurs at Tarquinia, 525-500 BCE, Etruscan.jpg|thumb|[[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] dancer in the [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
Etruscan art is usually divided into a number of periods: 

*900 to 675 BC – '''Early Villanovan''' period. Already the emphasis on [[funerary art]] is evident. [[Impasto pottery]] with geometric decoration, or shaped as [[hut urn]]s.  Bronze objects, mostly small except for vessels, were decorated by moulding or by incised lines. Small statuettes were mostly handles or other fittings for vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;    
*675–575 BC – '''Oriental''' or Orientalising period.  Foreign trade with established Mediterranean civilizations interested in the metal ores of Etruria and other products from further north led to imports of foreign art, especially that of Ancient Greece, and some Greek artists immigrated.  Decoration adopted a Greek, Egyptian and Near Eastern vocabulary with [[palmette]]s and other motifs, and the foreign [[lion]] was a popular animal to depict. The Etruscan upper class grew wealthy and began to fill their large tombs with [[grave goods]].  A native [[Bucchero]] pottery, now using the [[potter's wheel]], went alongside the start of a Greek-influenced tradition of painted vases, which until 600 drew more from [[Corinth]] than [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (ii); Boardman, 349&lt;/ref&gt;   
*575–480 BC – '''Archaic''' period - Prosperity continued to grow, and Greek influence grew to the exclusion of other Mediterranean cultures, despite the two cultures coming into conflict as their respective zones of expansion met each other. The period saw the emergence of the Etruscan temple, with its elaborate and brightly painted [[terracotta]] decorations, and other larger buildings.  Figurative art, including human figures and narrative scenes, grew more prominent.  The Etruscans adopted stories from [[Greek mythology]] enthusiastically.  Paintings in [[fresco]] begin to be found in tombs (which the Greeks had stopped making centuries before), and were perhaps made for some other buildings.  The Persian conquest of [[Ionia]] in 546 saw a significant influx of Greek artist refugees.  Other earlier developments continued, and the period produced much of the finest and most distinctive Etruscan art.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iii)&lt;/ref&gt;   
*480–300 BC – '''Classical''' period - The Etruscans had now peaked in economic and political terms, and the volume of art produced reduced somewhat in the 5th century, with prosperity shifting from the coastal cities to the interior, especially the [[Po valley]].  In the 4th century volumes revived somewhat, and previous trends continued to develop without major innovations in the repertoire, except for the arrival of [[red-figure vase painting]], and more sculpture such as sarcophagi in stone rather than terracotta. Bronzes from [[Vulci]] were exported widely within Etruria and beyond.  The Romans were now picking off the Etruscan cities one by one, with [[Veii]] being conquered around 396.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iv)&lt;/ref&gt;
*300–50 BC – '''Hellenistic''' or late phase.  Over this period the remaining Etruscan cities were all absorbed into Roman culture, and the extent to which art and architecture should be described as Etruscan or Roman is often difficult to judge. Distinctive Etruscan types of object gradually ceased to be made, with the last painted vases appearing early in the period, and large painted tombs ending in the 2nd century.  Styles continued to follow broad Greek trends, with increasing sophistication and classical realism often accompanied by a loss of energy and character.  [[Bronze]] statues, now increasingly large, were sometimes replicas of Greek models.  The large [[Greek temple]] [[pediment]] groups of sculptures were introduced, but in terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (v)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etruscans were very accomplished sculptors for which notable examples in terracotta and bronze are testimony. Though the renowned "[[Capitoline Wolf]]" (at the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline Museum]] of Rome) is now suggested to have been manufactured in the 13th century AD, some of the more famous examples include (in rough chronological order):

*The [[Centaur of Vulci]], 590–580 BC, [[National Etruscan Museum]], from the [[Villa Giulia]]
*the painted terracotta [[Apollo of Veii]], 510–500 BC, from the temple at [[Portanaccio]] attributed to [[Vulca]] at the [[National Etruscan Museum]]
*the painted terracotta [[Sarcophagus of the Spouses]], late 6th century BC, from Cerveteri at the National Etruscan Museum
*the bronze [[Chimera of Arezzo]], dated 400 BC, at the National Archaeological Museum (Florence)
*The [[Mars of Todi]], a [[bronze sculpture]] from 400 BC in the [[Museo Etrusco Gregoriano]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] 
*The [[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]], 150–140 BC, a masterpiece of Etruscan art in terracotta, now at the [[British Museum]]
*[[The Orator]], or Aule Metele ("L'Arringatore" in Italian), bronze found in Umbria now at the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)]])

The [[Apollo of Veii]] is a good example of the mastery with which Etruscan artists produced these large art pieces. It was made, along with others, to adorn the temple at [[Portanaccio]]’s roof line. Although its style is reminiscent of the Greek [[Kroisos Kouros]], the notion of having statues on the top of the roof is entirely an Etruscan derivation.&lt;ref name ="Ramage 2009"&gt;(Ramage 2009: 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall-painting==
{{see|Tomb of the Leopards}}
[[File:Tomba del Triclinio SAM 3996.JPG|thumb|Fuller view of the tomb illustrated above]]
[[File:Tomba degli Auguri.jpg|thumb|Rear wall painting in [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
The Etruscan paintings that have survived are almost all wall [[fresco]]es from tombs, mainly located in [[Tarquinia]], and dating from roughly 670 BC to 200 BC, with the peak of production between about 520 and 440 BC.  The Greeks very rarely painted their tombs in the equivalent period, with rare exceptions such as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]] and southern Italy, and the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] royal tombs at [[Vergina]].  The whole tradition of Greek painting on walls and panels, arguably the form of art that Greek contemporaries considered their greatest, is almost entirely lost, giving the Etruscan tradition, which undoubtedly drew much from Greek examples, an added importance, even if it does not approach the quality and sophistication of the best Greek masters.  It is clear from literary sources that temples, houses and other buildings also had wall-paintings, but these have all been lost, like their Greek equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Steingräber, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etruscan tombs, which housed the remains of whole lineages, were apparently sites for recurrent family rituals, and the subjects of paintings probably have a more religious character than might at first appear. A few detachable painted terracotta panels have been found in tombs, up to about a metre tall, and fragments in city centres.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 243; Vermeule, 157-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The frescoes are created by applying paint on top of fresh plaster, so that when the plaster dries the painting becomes part of the plaster, and consequently an integral part of the wall. Colors were created from ground up minerals of different colors and were then mixed to the paint. Fine brushes were made of animal hair.

From the mid 4th century BC [[chiaroscuro]] modelling began to be used to portray depth and volume.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 352&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes scenes of everyday life are portrayed, but more often traditional mythological scenes. The depiction of human anatomy never approaches Greek levels. The concept of proportion does not appear in any surviving frescoes and we frequently find portrayals of animals or men out of proportion. One of the best-known Etruscan frescoes is that of the Tomb of the Lioness at Tarquinia.

==Vase painting==

{{main|Etruscan vase painting}}
Etruscan vase painting was produced from the 7th through the 4th centuries BC, and is a major element in Etruscan art. It was strongly influenced by [[Greek vase painting]], followed the main trends in style, especially those of [[Athens]], over the period, but lagging behind by some decades. The Etruscans used the same techniques, and largely the same shapes. Both the [[black-figure vase painting]] and the later [[red-figure vase painting]] techniques were used.  The subjects were also very often drawn from Greek mythology in later periods. 

Besides being producers in their own right, the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek pottery outside Greece, and some Greek painters probably moved to Etruria, where richly decorated vases were a standard element of grave inventories.  It has been suggested that many or most elaborately painted vases were specifically bought to be used in burials, as a substitute, cheaper and less likely to attract robbers, for the vessels in silver and bronze that the elite would have used in life.

More fully characteristic of Etruscan ceramic art are the burnished, unglazed [[bucchero]] terracotta wares, rendered black in a reducing kiln deprived of oxygen. This was an Etruscan development based on the pottery techniques of the Etruscans' Villanovan predecessors.

==Painted terracotta panels==
A few large terracotta [[Pinax|pinakes]] or plaques, much larger than are typical in Greek art, have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork==
[[File:Etruscan antiquities in the British Museum DSCF0012 02.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Relief mirror-back with "Herekele" ([[Hercules]]) seizing Mlacuch (500–475 BC)]]
The Etruscans were masters of bronze-working as shown by the many outstanding examples in museums, and from accounts of the statues sent to Rome after their conquest. &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome as a Museum: Power, Identity, and the Culture of Collecting, Steven Rutledge, OUP Oxford, 26 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pliny, the Romans looted 2,000 bronze statues from the city of [[Volsinii]] alone after capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny: Historia Naturalis xxxiv.16&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[Monteleone chariot]] is one of the finest examples of large bronzework and is the best-preserved and most complete of the surviving works.

The Etruscans had a strong tradition of working in [[bronze]] from very early times, and their small bronzes were widely exported. Apart from cast bronze, the Etruscans were also skilled at the engraving of cast pieces with complex linear images, whose lines were filled with a white material to highlight them; in modern museum conditions with this filling lost, and the surface inevitably somewhat degraded, they are often much less striking and harder to read than would have been the case originally. This technique was mostly applied to the roundish backs of polished bronze mirrors and to the sides of [[cista]]e.  A major centre for cista manufacture was [[Praeneste]], which somewhat like early Rome was an Italic-speaking town in the Etruscan cultural sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;  Some mirrors, or mirror covers (used to protect the mirror's reflective surface) are in a low [[relief]].

==Funerary art==
[[File:British Museum Etruscan 8-2.jpg|thumb|Painted terracotta [[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]], about 150–130 BCE]]

The Etruscans excelled in portraying humans. Throughout their history they used two sets of burial practices: [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]].&lt;ref&gt;(Turfa 2005: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Cinerary urns (for cremation) and sarcophagi (for inhumation) have been found together in the same tomb showing that throughout generations, both forms were used at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 56, note 1)&lt;/ref&gt;   
In the 7th century they started depicting human heads on canopic urns and when they started burying their dead in the late 6th century they did so in terracotta sarcophagi.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"&gt;(Ramage 2009:51)&lt;/ref&gt; These sarcophagi were decorated with an image of the deceased reclining on the lid alone or sometimes with a spouse.  The Etruscans invented the custom of placing figures on the lid which later influenced the Romans to do the same.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"/&gt; These urns were widely popular in Etruria and, from there, the style made its way to Chiusi. Etruscans made urns using unrefined clay such as impasto. This was discovered due to their almost exact resemblance to one another. They have been identified as far back as the third century B.C. and are technically still used to this day (caskets.) Examples of these pieces can be found today in museums all around the world.

The Hellenistic period funerary urns were generally made in two pieces. The top lid usually depicted a banqueting man or woman (but not always) and the container part was either decorated in relief in the front only or, on more elaborate stone pieces, carved on its sides.&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 34)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the terracotta urns were being mass-produced using clay in Northern Etruria (specifically in and around [[Chiusi]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 100)&lt;/ref&gt; Often the scenes decorated in relief on the front of the urn were depicting generic Greek influenced scenes.&lt;ref&gt;(Nielsen 1995:328)&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these urns did not require skilled artists and so what we are left with is often mediocre, unprofessional art, made en masse.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; However the color choices on the urns offer evidence as to dating, as colors used changed over time.

==Art and religion==
[[Image:5th-4th century BCE Etruscan necklace by Mary Harrsch.jpg|thumb|5th to 4th century BC necklace in gold]]
Etruscan art was often religious in character and, hence, strongly connected to the requirements of [[Etruscan religion]].  The Etruscan afterlife was negative, in contrast to the positive view in [[ancient Egypt]] where it was but a continuation of earthly life, or the confident relations with the gods as in [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greece]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}}  Roman interest in Etruscan religion centred on their methods of [[divination]] and propitiating and discovering the will of the gods, rather than the gods themselves, which may have distorted the information that has come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Most remains of Etruscan [[funerary art]] have been found in excavations of cemeteries (as at [[Cerveteri]], [[Tarquinia]], [[Populonia]], [[Orvieto]], [[Vetulonia]], [[Norchia]]), meaning that what we see of Etruscan art is primarily dominated by depictions of religion and in particular the [[funerary cult]], whether or not that is a true reflection of Etruscan art as a whole.

==Museums==
Etruscan tombs were heavily looted from early on, initially for precious metals.  From the Renaissance onwards Etruscan objects, especially painted vases and sarcophagi, were keenly collected. Many were exported before this was forbidden, and most major museum collections of classical art around the world have good selections.  But the major collections remain in Italian museums in Rome, Florence, and other cities in areas that were formerly Etruscan, which include the results of [[modern archaeology]].

Major collections in Italy include the [[National Etruscan Museum]] ({{lang-it|Museo Nazionale Etrusco}}) in the [[Villa Giulia]] in Rome, [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in Florence, [[Vatican Museums]], [[Tarquinia National Museum]], and the [[The Archeological Civic Museum (MCA) of Bologna|Archeological Civic Museum]] in [[Bologna]], as well as more local collections near important sites such as [[Cerveteri]], [[Orvieto]] and [[Perugia]].

The '''evolution of morality''' refers to the emergence of human moral behavior over the course of [[human evolution]]. [[Morality]] can be defined as a system of ideas about right and wrong conduct. In everyday life, morality is typically associated with [[human behavior]],  and not much thought is given to the social conducts of other creatures. The emerging fields of [[evolutionary biology]] and in particular [[sociobiology]] have argued  that, though human [[social behavior]]s are complex, the precursors of human morality can be traced to the behaviors of many other [[social animal]]s. Sociobiological explanations of human behavior are still controversial. The traditional view of social scientists has been that morality is a construct, and is thus culturally relative, although others argue that there is a [[science of morality]].

==Animal sociality==
{{see also|Social animal}}
Though other animals may not possess what humans may perceive as moral behavior, all social animals have had to modify or restrain their behaviors for group living to be worthwhile. Typical examples of behavioral modification can be found in the societies of [[ants]], [[bees]] and [[termites]]. Ant colonies may possess millions of individuals. [[E. O. Wilson]] argues that the single most important factor that leads to the success of ant colonies is the existence of a sterile worker caste. This caste of females are subservient to the needs of their mother, the [[Queen ant|queen]], and in so doing, have given up their own reproduction in order to raise brothers and sisters. The existence of sterile castes among these social insects significantly restricts the competition for mating and in the process fosters cooperation within a colony. Cooperation among ants is vital, because a solitary ant has an improbable chance of long-term survival and reproduction. However, as part of a group, colonies can thrive for decades. As a consequence, ants are one of the most successful families of species on the planet, accounting for a [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that rivals that of the human species.&lt;ref name="ants"&gt;{{cite book

The basic reason that social animals live in groups is that opportunities for survival and reproduction are much better in groups than living alone. The social behaviors of mammals are more familiar to humans. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like [[empathy]] and [[altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Richard|author2=Lee, P.C. |author3=Njiraini, N. |author4=Poole, J.H. |author5=Sayialel, K. |author6=Sayialel, S. |author7=Bates, L.A. |author8= Moss, C.J. |title=Do Elephants Show Empathy?|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2008|volume=15|series=10-11|pages=204–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"&gt;Rodriguez, Tommy (2011).

== Primate sociality ==
{{See also|Altruism in animals}}
Humanity’s closest living relatives are [[common chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s. These primates share a [[common ancestor]] with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of [[social norm]]s,  realization of "self", and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/14/AR2008081403049.html|title=Barbara J.

King|author=|date=|website=randomhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality.
Many social animals such as primates, dolphins, and whales have shown to exhibit what [[Michael Shermer]] refers to as premoral sentiments. According to Shermer, the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:

:'' attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group''.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer argues that these premoral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, lack of [[group cohesion]] could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of reciprocity. Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} For example, chimpanzees are more likely to [[food sharing|share food]] with individuals who have previously [[Personal grooming|groomed]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimpanzees Share Forbidden Fruit|first1=Kimberley J.|last1=Hockings|first2=Tatyana|last2=Humle|first3=James R.|last3=Anderson|first4=Dora|last4=Biro|first5=Claudia|last5=Sousa|first6=Gaku|last6=Ohashi|first7=Tetsuro|last7=Matsuzawa|date=12 September 2007|publisher=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000886|pmid=17849015 | pmc=1964537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/Wilkinson84.pdf|title=Reciprocal food sharing in the vampire bat|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals such as Capuchin monkeys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primates.com/monkeys/fairness.html|title=Monkey research : monkeys show sense of justice |website=www.primates.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/12/08/0810957105|title=The absence of reward induces inequity aversion in dogs|first1=Friederike|last1=Range|first2=Lisa|last2=Horn|first3=Zsófia|last3=Viranyi|first4=Ludwig|last4=Huber|date=7 December 2008|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=pnas.0810957105|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810957105|pmid=19064923|pmc=2629244}}&lt;/ref&gt; also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors.

Chimpanzees live in [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals.  As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of [[social control]], [[conflict resolution]] and group solidarity. This numerical limit is theorized to be hard coded in our [[gene]]s since even modern humans have difficulty maintaining stable social relationships with [[Dunbar's number|more than 100–200 people]].  According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. People also apply a degree of judgment and reason not seen in the animal kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==The punishment problems==
While groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing many of them, any characteristics that entail impunity are positively selected by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1979). Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically punishing individuals aware of their breach of rules would select against the ability to be aware of it, precluding any coevolution of both conscious choice and a sense of it being the basis for moral and penal liability in the same species.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). "Against 'Sociobiology'". [letter] New York Review of Books 22 (Nov. 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human social intelligence==
The [[Dunbar's number|social brain hypothesis]], detailed by [[Robin Dunbar|R.I.M Dunbar]] in the article ''The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution'', supports the fact that the brain originally evolved to process factual information. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of [[color vision]]. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. 2009. The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution. Annals of Human Biology 562-572.&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind as defined by [[Martin Brüne|M. Brune]], is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"&gt;Brune, M., and Brunecohrs, U. 2006. Theory Of Mind—Evolution, Ontogeny, Brain Mechanisms And Psychopathology. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, 30:437-455.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced [[social intelligence]]. Collectively, group living requires cooperation and generates conflict. Social living puts strong evolutionary selection pressures on acquiring social intelligence due to the fact that living in groups has advantages. Advantages to group living include protection from predators and the fact that groups in general outperform the sum of an individual’s performance. But, from an objective point of view, group living also has disadvantages, such as, competition from within the group for resources and mates. This sets the stage for something of an evolutionary arms race from within the species.

Within populations of social animals, altruism, or acts of behavior that are disadvantageous to one individual while benefiting other group members has evolved. This notion seems to be contradictory to evolutionary thought, due to the fact that an organism's fitness and success is defined by its ability to pass genes on to the next generation. According to [[Ernst Fehr|E. Fehr]], in the article, ''The Nature of Human Altruism'', the evolution of altruism can be accounted for when [[kin selection]] and [[inclusive fitness]] are taken into account; meaning [[reproductive success]] is not just dependent on the number of offspring an individual produces, but also the number of offspring that related individuals produce.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., &amp; Fischbacher, U. 2003.  The Nature Of Human Altruism. Nature 425:785-791.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of familial relationships altruism is also seen, but in a different manner typically defined by the [[prisoner's dilemma]], theorized by [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]]. The prisoner's dilemma serves to define cooperation and defecting with and against individuals driven by incentive, or in Nash's proposed case, years in jail. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat. In the tit-for-tat strategy, an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection.

Brune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human. The emergence of this unique trait is perhaps where the divergence of the modern human begins, along with our acquisition of language. Humans use metaphors and imply much of what we say. Phrases such as, "You know what I mean?" are not uncommon and are direct results of the sophistication of the human theory of mind. Failure to understand another's intentions and emotions can yield inappropriate social responses and are often associated with human mental conditions such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], some forms of [[dementia]], and [[psychopathy]]. This is especially true for autism spectrum disorders, where social disconnect is evident, but non-social intelligence can be preserved or even in some cases augmented, such as in the case of a savant.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"/&gt; The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior.

==Evolution of religion==
{{see also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents. By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

==The Wason selection task==
{{See also|Wason selection task|Altruism#Scientific viewpoints|}}
In an experiment where subjects must demonstrate abstract, complex reasoning, researchers have found that humans (as has been seen in other animals) have a strong innate ability to reason about social exchanges. This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1870/the-science-good-and-evil?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==
[[Disgust]], one of the [[basic emotions]], may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective. One example is things that increase the risk of an [[infectious disease]] such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological [[decomposition]], a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor [[hygiene]], and various body fluids such as [[feces]], [[vomiting|vomit]], [[phlegm]], and [[blood]]. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as [[incest]] (the [[incest taboo]]) or unwanted sexual advances.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"/&gt; Still another example are behaviors that may threaten group cohesion or cooperation such as cheating, lying, and stealing. [[MRI]] studies have found that such situations activate areas in the brain associated with disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J.

'''Fructification''' ({{Lang-la|fructificatio}}) are the generative parts of the [[plant]] ([[flower]] and [[fruit]]) (as opposed to its vegetative parts: [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], [[root]]s and [[Leaf|leaves]]). Sometimes it is applied more broadly to the generative parts of [[gymnosperm]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]], though they produce neither fruit nor flower.

Since the works of [[Andrea Caesalpino]] (1519–1603) the characters of fructification have been extensively used as a basis for the [[scientific classification]] of plants. [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) raised the description of the parts of fructification to an unprecedented level of precision. He insisted that [[genus|genera]] and the higher groups of plants must be characterised in terms of the fructification alone without using vegetative parts (which can be used only to characterise the [[species]] within genera). At that time it was believed that all plants have flowers and fruits. It was not until the nineteenth century that the important difference between [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s was recognised and the use of terms flower and fruit was restricted to the flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s).

Later plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] used a more balanced approach and re-introduced the use of the vegetative parts of the plant as a basis for characters at different levels of taxonomic [[hierarchy]].

{{Infobox Telescope|locmapin=Canary Islands}}
The '''Galaxy Hα Fabry-Perot System''' for WHT '''(GHaFaS)''' is an astronomical instrument installed on the 4.2 metre [[William Herschel Telescope|William Herschel Telescope (WHT)]] at [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]] on the Canary island of La Palma.&lt;ref name=wht/&gt; [[First light (astronomy)|First light]] was on 6 July 2007.&lt;ref name=firstlight /&gt; Its name is a play on the acronym: '''G'''alaxy '''Hα Fa'''bry-Perot '''S'''ystem and the Spanish word "''gafas''" meaning spectacles. It produces maps, in intensity and velocity, of extended objects in the sky (which could be external galaxies, star forming regions in the Galaxy, planetary nebulae, or supernova remnants, as examples), which radiate in the [[H-alpha line]], emitted by [[ionized hydrogen]] in interstellar space. It can also be used for a variety of other lines but these will not be covered in this short description.

The possibility to detect the emission line of interstellar neutral hydrogen at [[Hydrogen line|21 centimeters wavelength]] revolutioned astronomy in the second half of the 20 century, as it gave us a powerful tool to explore the structure and evolution of galaxies and the star formation within them. A second revolution came when, at millimetre wavelengths, molecular hydrogen could be detected and measured in directly using, above all, the emission from the lines of the CO molecule. Surprisingly the emission from the third phase of interstellar hydrogen, the ionized phase, which is at optical wavelengths, has hadless attention. The basic aim of '''GHaFaS''' is to make up for lost time by taking H-alpha velocity fields of galaxies at highspatial and spectral resolution.

The performance of '''GHaFaS''' is comparable to that of the largest radiotelescope producing 21&amp;nbsp;cm maps in atomic hydrogen: the [[Very Large Array|VLA]]. Over a field of 3.4 arcminutes in diameter it produces a map of ionized hydrogen emission with a nominal velocity resolution of 5&amp;nbsp;km/s and an angular resolution limited by the "seeing" due to atmospheric turbulence of less than 1 arcsecond when used on the [[William Herschel Telescope|WHT]]. These values are similar to the best figures obtainable with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]]. However a good quality map can be obtained in half a night's observing with '''GHaFaS''', which is considerably more time efficient than that on the [[Very Large Array|VLA]]. Comparison with [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]], the best system for observing molecular hydrogen, is not so easy. [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] produces maps at considerably higher angular resolution, but over a much smaller field. We could summarize by saying that at the moment '''GHaFaS''' is best suited to observing "local" galaxies, out of 100 Mpc distance, while [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] is superior at intermediate and high redshift, in terms of angular and velocity resolutions.

'''GHaFaS''' is very well suited to exploring the fine details of the internal kinematics of galaxies, as well as any phenomena related to the formation of high mass stars and their surroundings. It has been used to make the best measurements to date of the corotation radii of the density wave systems related to galaxy bars, and to explore the initial phases of the huge superbubbles caused by the combined stellar winds and supernovae of the OB associations of massive young stars, among a variety of its observing achievements.

The '''German Solar Mobility Association''' / German '''Bundesverband Solare Mobilität''' (Federal Association Solar Mobility) is an interest group in Germany to further electric mobility in combination of regenerative resources for the required electricity.  The BSM is the provider of the [[Park &amp; Charge]] network in Germany. The BSM is member of a number of committees of the German government including the [[National Electric Mobility Platform|Na]][[National Electric Mobility Platform|tional Electric Mobility Platform]].

== History ==
The association was founded on 2. December 1989 by Roland Reichel and Thomic Ruschmeyer to assemble a number of makers and drivers of solar cars that had been mostly [[Motorised quadricycle|electric quadricycle]]s at the time (often summarized in English in the [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]] class). Its original name ''Fahrer- und Konstrukteurverband Solarmobil'' points to the original research interest in [[solar vehicle]]s around that time (the [[Tour de Sol]] races began in 1985).

In that the association has a similar root as the Swiss ''Elektromobil Club der Schweiz'' (founded in 1993) and the German association took on a new name as ''Bundesverband Solarmobil'' (Federal Association Solar Mobiles) in 1992. Both organizations have since cooperated and in 1997 the BSM took over the responsibility for the parts of the Park &amp; Charge network in Germany (originally conceived from a pilot project in Switzerland to allow drivers of solar vehicles to plug into the public electricity grid to enlarge their operating range).

In the mid of 2004 the association was renamed to ''Federal Association Solar Mobility'' to emphasize its interest beyond construction of vehicles.

The periodical of the association is the quarterly "Solarmobil" journal that had been originally created by the Solar Mobile Association Erlangen (Solarmobil Verein Erlangen) in 1987. The journal serves as the joint organ of the regional solar mobile clubs and the federal association since 1991. The journal has a total circulation of 2000 copies (12-2008).

The '''Institute of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology''' (IBB) is an autonomous institute with an affiliation to the [[University of Pune]]. It was established in 2002 under the 'University with Potential for Excellence' program funded by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] of [[India]] (UGC). It was established with a view to promote [[research and development]] activities in [[bioinformatics]] and [[biotechnology]], with a focus on creation of high quality [[research]] environment and [[human resources]].

IBB is situated on the [[campus]] of [[University of Pune]], [[India]]. It has been widely regarded that IBB shares the same relationship with the [[University of Pune]] as the [[Center for Excellence in Basic Sciences, Mumbai]] shares with the [[University of Mumbai]].

== Programs at the Institute ==

===Contrast to technical colleges===
Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level -- parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]]-granting institution.  The academic level of these schools varies by course of study; some courses are geared toward immediate employment in a trade, while others are designed to transfer into a four-year program.  Some of these technical institutes are for-profit organizations (such as [[ITT Technical Institute]]) compared to most other non-profit educational institutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21694">An '''Internet leak''' occurs when a party's [[confidentiality|confidential]] information is released to the public on the [[Internet]]. Various types of information and data can be, and have been, "leaked" to the Internet, the most common being personal information, computer [[software]] and [[source code]], and artistic works such as books or [[album]]s. For example, a musical album is leaked if it has been made available to the public on the Internet before its official release date; and is still intended to be confidential.

== Source code leaks ==
'''[[Source code]] leaks''' are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] which allow people to get source files by exploiting, by software [[computer bug|bugs]], or by employees that have access to the sources of part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company.

There were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development.

For instance, as [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer IIS]] released in 1994 only a low quality version of their [[MP3]] encoding software ([[l3enc]]), a hacker named SoloH gathered the [[source code]] from the unprotected servers of the [[University of Erlangen]] and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/09/the-heavenly-jukebox/305141/ The heavenly jukebox] on [[The Atlantic]] ''"To show industries how to use the codec, MPEG cobbled together a free sample program that converted music into MP3 files. The demonstration software created poor-quality sound, and Fraunhofer did not intend that it be used. The software's "source code"—its underlying instructions—was stored on an easily accessible computer at the University of Erlangen, from which it was downloaded by one SoloH, a hacker in the Netherlands (and, one assumes, a Star Wars fan). SoloH revamped the source code to produce software that converted compact-disc tracks into music files of acceptable quality."'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=3M2hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;dq=SoloH+mp3+source+code&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FlIeulG_zi&amp;sig=VKYpKgUjOXqOk_aBEH5Kfi3WKk4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8la2n46TRAhUMe1AKHT7fBb4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=SoloH%20mp3%20source%20code&amp;f=false Pop Idols and Pirates: Mechanisms of Consumption and the Global Circulation ...] by Dr Charles Fairchild&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1765/989 Technologies of Piracy? - Exploring the Interplay  Between Commercialism and Idealism in the Development of MP3 and DivX] by HENDRIK STORSTEIN SPILKER, SVEIN HÖIER, page 2072, [[International Journal of Communication]] 7 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc/ euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1996 [[Electronic Arts]] accidentally put  the source code of [[FIFA 97]] on a demo disc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotaku.com/5882488/when-ea-sports-accidentally-put-a-games-source-code-on-a-demo-disc When EA Sports Accidentally Put a Game's Source Code on a Demo Disc] by Luke Plunkett on [[kotaku.com]] (02-05-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a [[software hacking|hacker]] exploited a security hole in [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Microsoft Office Outlook|Outlook]] to get the complete source of the video game ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', which was under development at the time.&lt;ref name="source code leak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/10/07/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ |title=Playable Version of Half-Life 2 Stolen |work=CNN Money |accessdate=February 14, 2007 | date=2003-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-21-the-boy-who-stole-half-life-2-article |title=The Boy Who Stole Half-Life 2 - The story behind the $250 million robbery. |first=Simon |last=Parkin |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |publisher=eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete source was soon available in various [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|file sharing network]]s.  This leak was rumored to be the cause of the game's delay,&lt;ref name="leak delays release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31783.html |title=Half Life 2 Source-Code Leak Delays Debut |work=TechNewsWorld |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later was stated not to be.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/ Catching up with the guy who stole Half-Life 2’s source code, 10 years later] by Simon Parkin on [[Ars Technica]] (Jun 19, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, source code to [[Diebold Election Systems]] Inc. [[voting machine]]s was leaked. Researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Rice University]] published a damning critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth.

In 2003 a Chinese Hacker acquired the [[Lineage II]] source code, and sold it to someone who set up alternative servers. Shutdown by [[FBI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmorpg.com/lineage-2/news/fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server-1000007104 fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server] on mmorpg.com (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212021338/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/feb07/iptheft020107.htm CRACKING THE CODE Online IP Theft Is Not a Game] on FBI.gov (02/01/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, one year after [[3dfx]] was bought by [[Nvidia]] and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/0305/25378.html Treiber-Quellcode von 3dfx im Netz aufgetaucht - Von Nvidia offenbar geduldet] by Christian Klaß on Golem.de (7 May 2003, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[fan-made]], updated drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuangel.net/NuDrivers/ NuAngel.net Drivers] on nuangel.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a large portion of [[Windows NT 4.0]]'s source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of [[Windows 2000]]'s were leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/114771/article.html Windows Code May Be Stolen] on [[PC World]] by Joris Evers (February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, allegedly "there are a dozen or so 'fucks' and 'shits', and hundreds of 'craps'." The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the "uglier" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atdt.freeshell.org/k5/story_2004_2_15_71552_7795.html|title=We Are Morons: a quick look at the Win2k source {{!}}{{!}} kuro5hin.org|website=atdt.freeshell.org|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from [[Mainsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also in 2004, partial (800&amp;nbsp;MB) proprietary source code that drives [[Cisco Systems]]' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which apparently enables some next-generation [[IPv6]] functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SecurityLab.ru|title=SecurityLab|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hackers stole source code (about 1&amp;nbsp;GiB) for [[Symantec]]'s [[pcAnywhere]] from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/symantec-suspected-breach-in-2006-didnt-confirm-until-anonymous-revealed-source-code.ars|title=Symantec suspected source code breach back in 2006|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, the source code of [[Norton Ghost|Norton Ghost 12]] and a [[Norton Anti-Spyware]] version were available via [[BitTorrent]].

In December 2007 and January 8, a [[Pirate Bay]] user published the sources of five [http://www.idera.com Idera] [[SQL]] products via BitTorrent.

In January 2011 the "stolen source code" of [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008]] was published on the Pirate Bay.

On May 20, 2011, [[EVE Online]]'s [[source code]] was published by someone on a [[GitHub]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/eve-online-source-code-posted-online-dmca-takedown-quickly-follows-1382821/ |title=Eve Online source code posted online, DMCA takedown quickly follows |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |publisher=geek.com |quote=It looks as though someone has posted the source code for the space MMO Eve Online there.

In 2011 the [[source code]] of [[GunZ: The Duel]] v1.5 [[Source code leak|became available]] online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ragezone.com/2011/11/20/gunz-1-5-source-code-released/ Gunz 1.5 Source Code released.] on ragezone.com (20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the source code of the [[Solaris 11]] operating system's kernel was leaked via BitTorrent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTAzMDE Oracle Solaris 11 Kernel Source-Code Leaked] on [[Phoronix]] by [[Michael Larabel]] (on 19 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 [[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'s [[X-Ray Engine]] [[source code]] (and its successor) became available on [[GitHub]] under a non-[[open-source license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray xray] on github.com (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16 xray-16] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2015 the [[AmigaOS]] 3.1 source code leaked to the web, confirmed by the rights holder [[Hyperion Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=AmigaOS-3.1-Leak-Confirmed| title=Hyperion Confirms Leak Of AmigaOS 3.1 Source Code

=== End-of-life leaks by developers ===
Sometimes software developers themselves will leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming [[abandonware]] after it has reached its [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]], allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to [[public domain]] or as [[open-source software|open-source]] can include scattered or lost [[intellectual property rights]]. An example is the [[video game]] ''[[Falcon 4.0]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408111542/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archivedate=2004-04-08 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |publisher=Boston.com|title=Diehard pilots keep Falcon flying|author=Hiawatha Bray|date=2004-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falcon4.0leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleared-to-engage.com/2011/03/12/interview-with-kevin-klemmick-lead-software-engineer-for-falcon-4-0/|title=Interview with Kevin Klemmick - Lead Software Engineer for Falcon 4.0 | publisher=Cleared-To-Engage |date=2011-03-12 |first=Giorgio |last=Bertolone |accessdate=2014-08-31 |quote=''[C2E] In 2000 the source code of Falcon 4.0 leaked out and after that groups of volunteers were able to make fixes and enhancements that assured the longevity of this sim.

Another notable example is an archive of [[Infocom]]'s video games [[source code]] which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the [[Internet Archive]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/ |title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=Apr 17, 2008|quote=''From an anonymous source close to the company, I've found myself in possession of the "Infocom Drive" — a complete backup of Infocom's shared network drive from 1989.[...] Among the assets included: design documents, email archives, employee phone numbers, sales figures, internal meeting notes, corporate newsletters, and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made''|publisher=waxy.org |first=Andy |last=Baio |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other leaks ==
* In late 1998, a number of confidential [[Microsoft]] documents later dubbed the ''[[Halloween documents]]'' were leaked to [[Eric S. Raymond]], an activist in the [[open-source software]] movement, who published and commented on them online. The documents revealed that internally Microsoft viewed free and open-source software such as [[Linux]] as technologically competitive and a major threat for Microsoft's dominance in the market, and they discussed strategies to combat them. The discovery caused a public controversy. The documents were also used as evidence in several court cases.
* [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting video game series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' has a history of having unconfirmed content leaked. While the first two games predated its online community, every game since has been leaked in some form:
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the [[Wii]] was leaked by a video on the [[Japanese language]] wii.com website, revealing unconfirmed playable characters on January 28, 2008 (three days before the game's Japanese release).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' was afflicted in August 2014 by the "ESRB leak", where many screenshots and limited video footage of the 3DS version were leaked by a supposed member of the [[ESRB]]. The leak gained traction very quickly due to the screenshots mostly containing elements that the game ratings board would be interested in, such as trophies of suggestively-dressed female characters (some of which were later found to be edited or cut altogether in the final game).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' was leaked in its entirety two weeks before its release, allowing many to play and datamine in advance. While the entire roster of characters and stages had already been officially revealed, many unrevealed collectibles, music tracks, and story elements were discovered and distributed. This prompted Nintendo to issue copyright strikes to many YouTube and Twitch channels.
* Several high-profile books have been leaked on the Internet before their official release date, including ''[[If I Did It]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', and an early draft of the first twelve chapters of ''[[Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]''. The leak of the latter prompted the author [[Stephenie Meyer]] to suspend work on the novel.
* On January 31, 2014 the original uncensored version of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" was leaked, when it was illegally pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without any approval by [[Comedy Central]]. The episode was heavily censored by the network when it aired in 2010 against the will of series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and was never formally released uncensored to the public. The episode was the second in a [[story arc|two parter]] and was censored after the airing of the [[200 (South Park)|first part]] as a result of [[death threats]] from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] who were angry of the episode's storyline satirizing censorship of [[depictions of Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=An uncensored version of South Park's controversial Muhammad episode has surfaced|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-uncensored-version-of-south-parks-controversia-107422|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015 the unaired ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "Boston" was leaked online. The episode was set to air during the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|fifth season]], but [[Adult Swim]] was forced to pull it to avoid further controversy surrounding the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzales|first1=Dave|title=Banned Aqua Teen Hunger Force Boston episode leaks online|url=http://www.geek.com/news/banned-aqua-teen-hunger-force-boston-episode-leaks-online-1620022/|publisher=[[Geek.com]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 13, 2016, the full list of qualifying teams and first round match-ups for the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] leaked on Twitter in the midst of a television special being broadcast by [[CBS Sports|CBS]] to officially unveil them. The leak exacerbated criticism of a new, two-hour format for the selection broadcast, which was criticized for revealing the full tournament bracket at a slower pace than in previous years.&lt;ref name="wp-ssratings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ratings for CBS's NCAA tournament selection show were almost as bad as show itself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/14/ratings-for-cbss-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-were-almost-as-bad-as-show-itself/|date=March 14, 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-twohour"&gt;{{cite news|title=NCAA says it's investigating the bracket leak that saved us from the two-hour Selection Sunday show|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-tournament-bracket-leak-20160314-story.html|date=March 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Jordania''' (born February 12, 1954 and also known under the misspelling of '''Joseph Zhordania''') is an [[Australian]]–[[Georgian people|Georgian]] [[ethnomusicologist]] and [[evolution]]ary [[musicologist]] and professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gelzer: Local Teacher Makes Mark On Georgian Folk Music|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5S0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RggGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6953,2060057&amp;dq=joseph-jordania&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=Nov 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Institute of Musicology of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Issue 5|year=2005|publisher=Muzikološki institut SANU|pages=197, 198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrifAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Joseph+Jordania%22&amp;dq=%22Joseph+Jordania%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BcYhUsGmGZSu4APvu4CgCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Honorary Fellow of the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the Head of the Foreign Department of the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] at [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]]. Jordania is known for his model of the origins of human [[choral singing]] in the wide context of [[human evolution]] and was one of founders of the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] in Georgia.

Jordania’s academic interests include study of worldwide distribution of choral [[polyphonic]] traditions, origins of [[choral singing]], origins of [[rhythm]], origins of human [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[behaviour]], cross-cultural prevalence of [[stuttering]], [[dyslexia]] and acquisition of [[phonological]] system in children, study of the [[cognitive]] threshold between animal and human cognitive abilities. His primary expertise is Georgian and Caucasian traditional music and vocal polyphony.

==Career==
Jordania was born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (former [[Soviet Union]]). He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in 1978. During 1979–1983 he was elected as the President of the Board of Creative Youth of Tbilisi. In 1982 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[musicology]]–[[ethnomusicology]] from Tbilisi Theatrical Institute, and served as lecturer, senior lecturer, assistant professor, and professor at the Department of Georgian Traditional Music at [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]]. For one year (in 1984) he served as a dean of the Faculty of Musicology. In 1991 he received the title [[D.Mus]] from [[Kiev Conservatory]]. From 1988 until 1995 Jordania was the head of the Musical Sector of the Centre of the Mediterranean Studies at the Tbilisi State University. He published his first monograph on choral polyphony in 1989. In 1984 he was instrumental in organizing the conference "Problems of Folk Polyphony". This conference became the beginning of the series of biannual international conferences (1984, 1986, 1988, 1998, 2000) and symposia (2002, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016) on traditional polyphony, and led to establishing the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] at Tbilisi State Conservatory in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doijašvili|first=Manana|title=The Vano Saradjishvili Tbilisi State Conservatoire, 1917-2007|year=2008|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|isbn=1600219101|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWOM8ia2-2wC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Joseph+Jordania%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-sUhUs-hFfLh4AP8wYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Joseph%20Jordania%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in recognition of "his contribution to systematic analysis of folk polyphonies of the world, proposing a new model for the origins of traditional choral singing in a broad context of human evolution" Jordania was awarded the [[Fumio Koizumi Prize for ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/21jj1e.html|title=21st Annual (2009) Koizumi Fumio Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Koizumi Fumio Prize|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering Program''' offers a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[industrial engineering]].  With a total of 133 credit hours, the program covers the major areas of industrial engineering, such as [[operations research]], production planning, [[inventory]] control, [[methods engineering]], [[quality control]], [[facility location]], [[manufacturing]], and facility layout.

==History==
The Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE) program in the Systems Engineering Department was first introduced in 1984 and has been revised in 1996 based on the '''Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology''' ([[ABET]]) recommendation after their first visit in 1993. The revision made in 1996 came after when the number of credit hours of the [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc) was reduced from 141 to 133 credit hours. The program has received ABET accreditation extension in 2010.

==Program Courses==
The ISE program has a total of 50 credit hours on required ISE courses, with the following descriptions:

A '''laconic phrase''' or '''laconism''' is a concise or [[wikt:terse|terse]] statement, especially a [[wikt:blunt|blunt]] and [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptical]] rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms'', 1984, ''s.v.'' 'concise' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8N4UReTJYhUC&amp;pg=PA172 p. 172].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Percy Smith, ''Synonyms Discriminated'' (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=17sXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA541 p. 541].&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Laconia]], the region of Greece including the city of [[Sparta]], whose ancient inhabitants had a reputation for verbal austerity and were famous for their blunt and often [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] remarks.

==Uses==
A laconic phrase may be used for efficiency (as in [[military jargon]]), for emphasis, for philosophical reasons (especially among thinkers who believe in minimalism, such as [[Stoicism|Stoics]]), or to better deflate a pompous individual.

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|138px|left|[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] ([[Hellenistic art#Later Roman copies|Roman copy]] of a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] bust)]]
A prominent example involves [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedon]]. After invading southern Greece and receiving the submission of other key [[city-state]]s, he turned his attention to Sparta and asked menacingly whether he should come as friend or foe. The reply was "''Neither''."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 233e [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html 1] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0198:chapter=69&amp;highlight=neither%2Cphilip 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing patience, he sent the message: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5n4iLuNvHlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0199766495&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikk--Mr6bXAhVJ7GMKHRt2BxEQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=raze&amp;f=false ''The Animal Spirit Doctrine and the Origins of Neurophysiology''], C.U.M. Smith, ''et al., Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Spartan [[ephor]]s again replied with a single word: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If.''&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De garrulitate'', 17 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0288%3Asection%3D17 1] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_garrulitate*.html 2] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20140804211840/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/49190/ 3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Subsequently, neither Philip nor his son [[Alexander the Great]] attempted to capture the city.{{refn|group=note|Sparta then declined to participate in Macedon's [[Wars of Alexander the Great#Persia|invasion of the Persian Empire]], a fact memorialized in a proclamation Alexander sent to Athens with armor captured at the [[Battle of the Granicus]]: [[:wikiquote:Macedonia#Historians|"Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia."]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'', I, 16, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Clear}}

===In humor===
The Spartans were especially famous for their dry, understated wit,&lt;ref name="Stuttard2014"&gt;{{cite book|first= David|last= Stuttard|title=A History of Ancient Greece in Fifty Lives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VAc7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;q=laconic+wit|date=14 October 2014| publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn= 978-0-500-77221-8|page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as "laconic humor". This can be contrasted with the "[[Attic Greek|Attic]] salt" or "Attic wit" {{ndash}} the refined, poignant, delicate humour of Sparta's chief rival, [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="Belfield1897"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry H.|last= Belfield|title= Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son and godson|url=

==History==
[[File:Chilon of Sparta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chilon of Sparta]]]]
Spartans paid less attention than other [[ancient Greeks]] to the development of [[Education in ancient Greece|education]], [[Ancient Greek art|arts]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Hippias Major]]'' 285b–d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some view this as having contributed to the characteristically blunt Laconian speech. However, [[Socrates]], in [[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']], appears to reject the idea that Spartans' economy with words was simply a consequence of poor literary education: "... they conceal their wisdom, and pretend to be blockheads, so that they may seem to be superior only because of their [[Spartan army|prowess in battle]] ... This is how you may know that I am speaking the truth and that the Spartans are the best educated in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]] and [[rhetoric|speaking]]: if you talk to any ordinary Spartan, he seems to be stupid, but eventually, like an expert marksman, he shoots in some brief remark that proves you to be only a child".&lt;ref&gt;''Protagoras'' 342b, d–e, from the translation given at the end of the section on Lycurgus in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207014704/http://www.e-classics.com/index.html e-classics.com].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|An alternative translation based on those by A. Beresford and R.E. Allen is as follows: "...they claim not to have any interest in [philosophy] and put on this big show of being morons...because...they want people to think that their superiority rests on fighting battles and being manly... You can tell that what I say is true, and that Spartans are the best educated in philosophy and argument, by this: if one associates with the most inferior Spartan, one at first finds him somewhat inferior in speech; but then at some chance point in the discussion he throws in a remark worthy of noticing, brief and terse, like a skilled marksman, so that the person he's talking to appears no better than a child."&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, R.E.|title=The Dialogues of Plato| volume= 3: Ion, Hippias Minor, Laches, and Protagoras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7StRBqCrebwC&amp;pg=203|year=1984|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300074383|pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Socrates was known to have admired Spartan laws,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Crito]]'' 52e.&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Laconophilia#Ancient Laconophilia|many other Athenians]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 544c.&lt;/ref&gt; but modern scholars have doubted the seriousness of his attribution of a secret love of philosophy to Spartans.&lt;ref name = "Taylor1949"&gt;[[A.E.

In general, however, Spartans were expected to be men of few words, to hold rhetoric in disdain, and to stick to the point. Loquacity was considered frivolous and unbecoming of sensible, down-to-earth [[Spartiate|Spartan peers]]. A Spartan youth was reportedly liable to have his thumb bitten as punishment for too verbose a response to a teacher's question.&lt;ref name="Cartledge2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Cartledge|title=Spartan Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgFlxZ14hkoC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=2012-12-13|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23124-5|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], '''letter notation''' is a system of representing a set of pitches, for example, the notes of a [[musical scale|scale]], by letters. For the complete Western [[diatonic scale]], for example, these would be the letters A-G, possibly with a trailing symbol to indicate a half-step raise--(a ''sharp'' {{music|#}}), or a half-step lowering (flat, {{music|b}}). This is the most common way of specifying a note in speech or in written text in English or German. In some European countries H is used instead of B, and B is used instead of B{{music|b}}.

Western letter pitch notation has the virtue of identifying discrete pitches, but among its disadvantages are its occasional inability to represent pitches or inflections lying outside those theoretically derived, or (leaving aside chordal and [[tablature]] notations) representing the relationship between pitches—e.g., it does not indicate the difference between a whole step and a half step, knowledge of which was so critical to Medieval and Renaissance performers and theorists.

==History==
{{main|Musical note#History of note names|l1=Note: History of note names}}

The earliest known letter notation in the Western musical tradition appear in the textbook on music ''De institutione musica'' by the 6th-century philosopher [[Boethius]]. A modified form is next found in the ''Dialogus de musica'' (ca. 1000) by Pseudo-Odo, in a discussion of the division of the [[monochord]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Medieval letter notations: a survey of the sources" by Alma Colk Browne (Ph. D. thesis. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1979) and "Medieval Canonics" by Jan Herlinger, in ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory,'' Thomas Christensen, ed., 2002. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-62371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guitar chords==
{{main|guitar chord}}
{{see also|Chord notation}}

Letter notation is the most common way of indicating chords for accompaniment, such as guitar chords, for example B{{music|b}}7. The bass note may be specified after a /, for example C/G is a C major chord with a G bass.

Where a [[capo]] is indicated, there is little standardisation. For example, after ''capo 3'', most music sheets will write A to indicate a C chord, that is, they give the chord ''shape'' rather than its pitch, but some specify it as C, others give two lines, either the C on top and the A on the bottom or vice versa. A few even use the /, writing C/A or A/C, but this notation is more commonly used for specifying a bass note and will confuse most guitarists.

==Choice of note names==

In the context of a piece of music, notes must be named for their [[diatonic functionality]]. For example, in the key of D major, it is not generally correct to specify G{{music|b}} as a melodic note, although its pitch may be the same as F{{music|#}}. (Note that in many [[musical tuning|tuning systems]] other than twelve tone [[equal temperament]], the pitch of G{{music|b}} is ''not'' the same as that of F{{music|#}}.) This is normally only an issue in describing the notes corresponding to the black keys of the piano; there is little temptation to write C as B{{music|#}} although both may be valid names of the same note. Each is correct in its context.

Note names are also used for specifying the natural scale of a [[transposing instrument]] such as a [[clarinet]], [[trumpet]], or [[saxophone]]. The note names used are conventional, for example a clarinet is said to be in B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, or A (the three most common registers), never in A{{music|#}}, and D{{music|#}}, and B{{music|bb}} (double-flat), while an [[alto flute]] is in G.

==Octaves==

Note names can also be qualified to indicate the octave in which they are sounded. There are several schemes for this, the most common being [[scientific pitch notation]].

Scientific pitch notation is often used to specify the range of an instrument. Where sharps or flats are necessary for this, these are related to the natural scale of the instrument if it has one, otherwise the choice is arbitrary.

==Other note naming schemes==

[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of [[solfege]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11826">In [[art history]], an '''[[Notname|anonymous master]]''' is an [[Old Master]] whose work is known, but whose name is lost.

==Renaissance==
Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''), such as those known by :
* Their true name or their father's name  :
** [[Filippino Lippi]] after his father [[Fra Filippo Lippi]]
* A chosen [[pseudonym]], possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :
** [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] worked on the gate of saint Gall
** [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)
** [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], after his father, a saddler (''sellier'')
** The [[Della Robbia]]s (after the Tuscan word ''robbia'', dyers' [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]], and his father, the dyer [[Luca della Robbia]])
** [[Masuccio Segondo]], student of [[Masuccio Primo]]
** etc.
* '''A surname attributed to him :'''
** [[Simone del Pollaiolo|Il Cronaca]], who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome
** [[Daniele da Volterra]], nicknamed  ''Il Braghettone'' (the [[breeches]] maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of [[pope Paul IV]]
** [[Luca della Robbia]], for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist
** [[Masaccio]], known as the idiot
** etc.
* '''A [[corporation]], whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :'''
** the [[Campionesi Masters]], sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, [[Bonino da Campione]], Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione)

==20th-century problems of attribution==
The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], to whom [[Bernard Berenson]] attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to [[Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like [[Barthélemy Eyck]]) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as [[Giovanni Gaddi (painter)|Giovanni Gaddi]] (after 1333 – 1383) maybe the ''Master of the Misericordia dell’Accademia''.

==Artists whose names have since been established==
In recent years the names of a variety of artists who were formerly listed as "anonymous" have become known; accordingly scholarly writings and museum labels have been changed to reflect their new identities. Much the most famous of these is the Master of Flémalle (c 1378–1445), painter of the [[comté de Hainaut]], who was established as [[Robert Campin]]. Other examples include:
* [[Jehan Bellegambe]], sometimes called the "master of colours".
* Master of 1419 – recognised as [[Battista di Biagio Sanguigni]], having painted and dated in 1419 the central panel for a triptych executed for Santa Maria a Latera, broken up and dispersed
* Master of the Chiostro degli Aranci – recognised as being [[Giovanni Consalvo]], fresco painter at the monastery at [[Badia Fiorentina]]
* [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] is the generally accepted as the painter known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of René of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts; he is also thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows
* The Dombild Master, as [[Stefan Lochner]]

[[File:Mac Cruimin (R. R. McIan).jpg|thumb|200px|"Mac Cruimin" a [[Romanticism|romanticised]] [[Victorian era]] depiction of a MacCrimmon [[Bagpipes|piper]] to MacLeod of MacLeod, illustrated by [[R. R. McIan]], from ''The Clans of the Scottish Highlands'', published in 1845.]]
The '''MacCrimmons''' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]: ''MacCruimein'') were a Scottish family, [[Bagpipes|pipers]] to the [[Scottish chief|chiefs]] of [[Clan MacLeod]] for an unknown number of generations.&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135"&gt;Gibson, pp. 127–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The MacCrimmon kindred was centred at [[Borreraig]] near the Clan MacLeod seat at [[Dunvegan]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]. At Borreraig the MacCrimmons taught at one of the best known "piping colleges" in the Highlands of Scotland.

Over time many pieces of ''[[Pìobaireachd]]'' (also known as ''[[Ceòl Mòr]]'': "Big music") have been attributed to the MacCrimmons by popular tradition, yet the actual authorship of these cannot be verified.&lt;ref name="Collinson(1966)--174–198"&gt;Collinson (1966), pp. 174–198.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular lore has made the MacCrimmon pipers one of the most famous families of ''hereditary pipers'' along with the [[Clan MacArthur|MacArthur]] (pipers to [[MacDonald of Sleat]]), [[Clan MacGregor|MacGregor]] (pipers to [[Campbell of Glenlyon]]), Rankins (pipers to the [[MacLeans of Coll, Duart and Mull]]).&lt;ref name="Gibson--138–143"&gt;Gibson, pp. 138–143.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''hereditary'' is not a native Gaelic term, though in popular lore it has been used to imply an above average skill or special status. In the [[Scottish Highlands]], and in Europe as a whole, until the [[Industrial Revolution]] most positions were [[inheritance|inherited]], "from the chief down to the humblest cotter".&lt;ref name="Gibson--13-14"&gt;Gibson, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, the MacCrimmon Memorial Piobaireachd Competition has taken place every year at [[Dunvegan Castle]] where players complete to win the 'silver chanter'. Competitors only play tunes attributed to the legendary MacCrimmon family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bagpipejourney.com/articles/results/silver-chanter.shtml Bagpipe Journey] bagpipejourney.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/courtsocial/article1812889.ece 'The Silver Chanter MacCrimmon Memorial Piobaireachd Competition'] thetimes.co.uk.

The origins of the MacCrimmons is debatable; even the genealogy of the pipers themselves is the subject of debate and speculation. In the 20th century the chiefs of Clan Macleod instated two MacCrimmons as hereditary pipers to the clan.

== Origins ==
The origin of the MacCrimmons is vague and has long been debated. One fanciful theory originating from Captain Neil MacLeod of Gesto was that the MacCrimmons descend from an Italian from the city of [[Cremona]]. Gesto was an intimate friend of Black John MacCrimmon (d 1822) the last hereditary piper to MacLeod, and it is reputed that from him Gesto received the "Cremona tradition". According to Gesto, the founder of the MacCrimmons was a priest from Cremona named Giuseppe Bruno, whose son Petrus (or Patrick Bruno) was born at Cremona in 1475 and later emigrated to [[Ulster]] in 1510. On Patrick's arrival in Ireland he then married the daughter of a piping family and [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] his name.&lt;ref name="Collinson(1975)--144"&gt;Collinson (1975), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Gesto's origin for the MacCrimmons is not taken seriously today.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}  According to [[Alastair Campbell of Airds]] the tradition was "fuelled by a non-Latinist finding the word 'Donald' in a 1612 Latin charter to Donald MacCrimmon, is that they were Italians from Cremona".&lt;ref name="Campbell--273" /&gt;

It is generally accepted that the surname may be of [[Norse language|Norse]] origin, with ''MacCrimmon'' being an [[Anglicised]] form of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Mac Ruimein'' meaning "son of ''Ruimean''". ''Ruimean'' is possibly a Gaelic form of the [[Old Norse]] personal name ''Hroðmundr'' which is composed of the elements ''hróð'' (meaning "fame") + ''mundr'' (meaning "protection").&lt;ref name="ancestry.com--McCrimmon-name-meaning"&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/McCrimmon-name-meaning.ashx McCrimmon Name Meaning and Origin] Retrieved on 2008-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

While this name origin would seem to tie in with the MacCrimmons' association with the MacLeods and the Isle of Skye the earliest references to a MacCrimmon (who were also pipers) appears in Campbell lands. The earliest reference is found in a bond of [[manrent]] of November 29, 1574 between Colin Campbell of [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]] and "John Tailzoure Makchrwmen in the Kirktoun of [[Balquhidder]] and Malccolme pyper Mackchrwmen in Craigroy", this reference being over ninety years before the MacCrimmons are found as pipers to MacLeod of Dunvegan in Skye.&lt;ref name="Campbell--273" /&gt; Another early reference is to a "Patrik Mcquhirryman, piper", mentioned in the ''Register of the Privy Council'', vol.5 (1592–99), who is mentioned in connection with a crime in [[Perthshire]].&lt;ref name="Gibson--336"&gt;Gibson, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alastair Campbell of Airds]] speculated that MacCrimmons were pipers to the Campbells of Glenorchy prior to the MacLeods of Dunvegan and Harris.&lt;ref name="Campbell--273"&gt;Campbell, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1690s the MacCrimmons are confirmed to have been located in the [[Hebrides]] and seem to have been recognised as masters of their craft. An order from [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|John Campbell]], [[Earl of Breadalbane]] to his [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], Campbell of Barcaldine reads: "Give McIntyre ye pyper fforty [[Pound Scots|pounds scots]] as his [[Apprenticeship|prentises(hi)p]] with McCrooman till May nixt as also provyde him in what Cloths he needs and dispatch him immediately to the Isles".&lt;ref name="Gibson--154"&gt;Gibson, p. 154. Rory Halford MacLeod dates the first quotation at 1698, however Keith Sanger gives 1697 referencing Breadalbane accounts dated 1697 ("Item sent with John MacIntyre the pyper at your Lordships desyre to be given McCrooman pyper in the Isles, £40")&lt;/ref&gt; The order seems to relate to a statement written by the mentioned earl of Breadalbane on April 22, 1697 at Taymouth in Perthshire: "Item paid to quantiliane McCraingie McLeans pyper for one complete year as prentyce fie for the Litle pyper before he was sent to McCrooman, the soume of £160" (modern translation: "Item, paid to Conduiligh Mac Frangaich [Rankin], MacLean's piper, for one complete year, as apprentice fee for the Little Piper before he [the Little Piper] was sent to MacCrimmon, the sum of £160").&lt;ref name="Gibson--69"&gt;Gibson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The MacCrimmon instructor that is referenced to may well be Pàdraig Òg.&lt;ref name="Gibson--154" /&gt;

Though much has been written about the MacCrimmon pipers to the MacLeods of [[Dunvegan]], there is little reliable information on them. The genealogy of the "hereditary pipers" has also been the subject of debate and speculation. The MacCrimmon of whom there is the most reliable information is Red Donald (''Dòmhnull Ruadh'')  (d July 31, 1825). Red Donald held [[Tacksman|tacks]] at Borreraig and Shader, and at Trien in [[Waternish]], and also a farm at [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]]. Red Donald's older brother was Black John (''Iain Dubh'') (d 1822), who also held the Boreraig tack. The MacCrimmon brothers had their most formative years during the [[Disarming Act]].&lt;ref name="Gibson--138–143" /&gt; Today it is accepted that these MacCrimmon brothers were sons of Malcolm (''Calum''), son of ''Pàdraig Òg'', who were both pipers to the chiefs of MacLeod and who also held land from them.&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135" /&gt; Red Donald and Black John's father and paternal uncle (Donald Ban) both piped for the Government forces in the 1745–46 Jacobite Rising.

==== Donald Ban ====
During the Jacobite Rising in 1745 the chief of Clan MacLeod supported the Hanoverians against the Jacobites.&lt;ref name="Adam&amp;Innes--167-168" /&gt; As MacLeod's piper, Donald Ban MacCrimmon (Dòmnhall/Dòmnhull Bàn MacCruimein – ''bàn'' meaning fairhaired cf [[Duncan Ban MacIntyre]]) took an active part in the conflicts against the Jacobite forces. Donald Ban was captured on December 23, 1745 following the Hanoverian defeat at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1745)]]. During his captivity, the pipers in the Jacobite army went on strike, refusing to play while the "King of Pipers" was held captive. According to popular tradition, Donald Ban wrote his well-known lament, ''Cha till, cha till, cha till, MacCruimein'' (meaning literally "MacCrimmon will not, will not, will not return." it has been variously titled "No more, no more, no more, MacCrimmon", "MacCrimmon shall never return", "MacCrimmon's Lament" among others) with an intimation of his fate.&lt;ref name="Campbell--137"&gt;Campbell, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eyre-Todd--223–228"&gt;Eyre-Todd, pp. 223–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Ban was eventually killed during the so-called "[[Rout of Moy]]" when on February 18, 1746, with the Jacobites marching on [[Inverness]], [[Lord Loudoun]] led 1,500 men in an attempt to capture [[Charles Edward Stuart]]. When the Government troops advanced upon [[Moy, Highland|Moy]] in the dark they encountered a watch made up of only a handful of [[Clan Mackintosh|Mackintoshes]]. In the encounter a single shot was fired and Donald Ban was instantly killed. With the death of their piper, panic quickly spread and Loudoun's forces fled in the "[[Rout of Moy]]".&lt;ref name="Campbell--137" /&gt; According to John William O'Sullivan's narrative, "McCloud had his Piper killed just by his side, &amp; was very much laughed at when he came back".&lt;ref name="Gibson--90"&gt;Gibson, p. 90. from the narrative of John William O'Sullivan (one of the ''Seven Men of Moidart'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Red Donald and Black John ====
===== Red Donald =====
The MacCrimmon of whom there is the most reliable information is Red Donald (''Dòmhnull Ruadh'')  (d July 31, 1825). Red Donald held tacks at Borreraig and Shader, and at Trien in Waternish, and also a farm at Glenelg. In the early 1770s he left Scotland and settled in North America in what is now North Carolina. He was away from Scotland for about seventeen years (1773–1790), though there is no record of him associated with his involvement with the pipes in any way. He settled in [[Anson County, North Carolina|Anson County]] (located in what is now North Carolina, USA). He took part in the [[American Revolutionary War]] as a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], raising troops for the  British forces and served as a Lieutenant. He claimed to have been present at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]] in 1776. He eventually lost an eye. Red Donald evidently evaded capture by the Americans at Yorktown in 1781. After the end of hostilities he spent seven years as a [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalist]] in [[Shelburne County, Nova Scotia]], (located in what is now Nova Scotia, Canada).&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135" /&gt;

He returned to Scotland in 1790, at the insistence of the Highland Society of London which defrayed the cost of MacCrimmon, his wife, and three of their four children's journey back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135" /&gt; In 1808 the [[Highland Society of London]] proposed that a College of Piping be re-established at [[Fort Augustus]], and that Lt. MacCrimmon should supervise instruction. This proposal was declined though, causing Red Donald "disappointment and mortification".&lt;ref name="Collinson(1975)--193–195"&gt;Collinson (1975), pp. 193–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Gibson Lockhart|J. G. Lockhart]]'s biography of [[Sir Walter Scott]]: "MacLeod's hereditary piper is called MacCrimmon, but the present holder of the office has risen above his profession. He is an old, a lieutenant in the army, and a most capital piper, possessing about 200 tunes and pibrochs, most of which will probably die with him as he declines to have any of his sons instructed in the art. He plays to MacLeod and his lady, but only in the same room, and maintains his minstrel privilege by putting on his bonnet so soon as he begins to play".&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135" /&gt;

Red Donald's decision not to pass his knowledge of piping on to his sons seems to be related to the massive emigration of the MacLeod estates in the 1770s, in which he himself gave up Borreraig and sailed for North America. Even in 1799 after his return to Scotland Macleod put many substantial tacks up for sale around Dunvegan. In his later life, he is associated with Glenelg, which MacLeod sold in 1798 and subsequently re-sold in 1811, 1824, 1837, further forcing the poorer Highlanders to emigrate to North America.&lt;ref name="Gibson--127–135" /&gt;

===== Black John =====
The last MacCrimmon to be hereditary piper to MacLeod of MacLeod (until the modern era) was Black John MacCrimmon. According to tradition in 1795 Black John decided to emigrate to America, though only got as far as [[Greenock]], before making up his mind to stay on the Isle of Skye, where he died in 1822 aged ninety-one.&lt;ref name="Adam&amp;Innes--167-168"&gt;Adam &amp; Innes, pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern Appointment of Hereditary Piper of MacLeod ====
The MacCrimmon piping dynasty is honoured in the form of cairn built in 1933, at Borreraig. This cairn, which overlooks Loch Dunvegan across to Dunvegan Castle, was paid for by clan societies and donations from around the world. The Gaelic inscription on the cairn reads in translation as: "The Memorial Cairn of the MacCrimmons of whom ten generations were the hereditary pipers of MacLeod and who were renowned as Composers, Performers and Instructors of the classical music of the bagpipe. Near to this post stood the MacCrimmons' School of Music, 1500–1800".&lt;ref name="ambaile.org.uk--38141"&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_photograph.jsp?item_id=38141 The MacCrimmon Memorial, Borreraig, Dunvegan, Skye] Retrieved on 2008-02-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last century, with a revival in clan interest, the modern chiefs of Clan MacLeod have instated two MacCrimmons as hereditary pipers to the chief. Malcolm Roderick MacCrimmon, a [[Canadians|Canadian]] born in 1918, started piping at the age of eight. With the start of the [[Second World War]] he joined the [[Calgary Highlanders]] and subsequently joined  the [[pipe band]]. At some point in time he wrote to Dame Flora MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod, asking for approval and support of his decorating his bagpipes in the MacLeod tartan. The chief then wrote to the regiment's [[Commanding Officer]] and permission was granted.&lt;ref name="calgaryhighlanders.com--macr"&gt;[http://www.calgaryhighlanders.com/history/macr.htm Malcolm MacCrimmon] Retrieved on 2008-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, MacCrimmon is said to have made a verbal agreement with the clan chief and became the ninth "hereditary piper" to the Chief of Clan MacLeod. MacCrimmon claimed there was proof of his descent from the MacCrimmons of Borreraig, and as such, that he was a descendant of the hereditary pipers to the Chief. In 1978, [[John MacLeod of MacLeod]], 29th chief of Clan MacLeod, while visiting [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, formally made Malcolm's son, Iain Norman MacCrimmon, the tenth hereditary piper to the Chief of Clan MacLeod.&lt;ref name="maccrimmonfamily.com--pipingtree"&gt;[http://www.maccrimmonfamily.com/pipingtree.html The Family Tree of Piping] Retrieved on 2008-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional MacCrimmons ==
A fictional member of the Clan is [[Jamie McCrimmon]], a piper to "[[Clan MacLaren]]" in the television series [[Doctor Who]], although in reality the MacCrimmons are pipers to Clan MacLeod. Much of the genealogical information for the family is fictional, for example, Finlay of the White Plaid, claimed as a MacCrimmon, by Dame Flora MacLeod and others, was always, in the oral traditions of Waternish, a celebrated Macleod.

Located in [[Portland, Maine]], the [http://www.mainehumanities.org Maine Humanities Council] 
was founded in 1975 as a private nonprofit affiliate of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. It is one of [[list of state humanities councils|56 humanities councils]] in the United States and its territories.

The organizational mission states: "The Maine Humanities Council engages the people of Maine in the power and pleasure of ideas, encouraging a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, fostering wisdom in an age of information, and providing context in a time of change. The Council uses the humanities to provide cultural enrichment for all Mainers and as a tool for social change, bringing people together in conversation that crosses social, economic and cultural barriers."

The Council's [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613145027/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/index.html programs] are statewide. They include literacy and reading and discussion initiatives for child care providers and preschoolers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070714063623/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/btr-home.html ''Born to Read'']), adult new readers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070630164534/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/new.html ''New Books, New Readers'']), rural Mainers and summer and year-round communities ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070714064609/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/talk.html ''Let's Talk About It'']), and health care professionals ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070613145027/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/index.html ''Literature &amp; Medicine: Humanities at the Heart of Health Care''], which was created by the Council and has traveled to other states, becoming a national model). The Council also offers a program for Maine teachers that introduces new content and new topics ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070617064406/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/teach.html ''Teachers for a New Century'']). The Council also offers [https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/letters.html Letters About Literature], a national program from the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress that encourages young people to write letters to their favorite authors, living or dead. In 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060621062933/http://mainehumanities.org/letters/national.html Lacy Craven], a Maine participant in this program, was a national winner.

In 1997, the Council incorporated into its organizational structure the Harriet P. Henry Center for the Book. The National Center for the Book was established in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1977 to promote books, reading, libraries, and literacy. The Maine Humanities Council established the Harriet P. Henry Center for the Book as one of the Maine state affiliates of the national program. It is one of only eight state humanities councils to be awarded this responsibility.

While most of the Council's work is in direct public humanities and educational programs that bring people together around books, it is also a grantmaker.  Since 1976, the Council has distributed over $4 million in grants to Maine libraries, museums, historical societies, colleges, schools, literacy groups, adult education programs, towns, and other organizations.

In 2002, the Council's Literature &amp; Medicine program was named as a Patient Quality Initiative by the Maine Hospital Association. The program then received the 2003 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize for Excellence in Public Programming from the [http://www.statehumanities.org Federation of State Humanities Councils]. The Council's national awards include a 1998 Award of Merit from the American Association of State and Local History for the Century Project and the 1998 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize for Excellence in Public Programming given by the Federation of State Humanities Councils for the Odyssey Project. Most recently, the Council received three national awards for its [https://web.archive.org/web/20070812210616/http://www.mainehumanities.org/taxingmaine.html Taxing Maine] program: the Award of Merit and the WOW award from the American Association for State and Local History and the 2007 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize from the Federation of State Humanities Councils. "Taxing Maine" is now available on the Council's [http://mainehumanities.org/podcast Humanities on Demand] podcast.

The Council is located on Brighton Avenue in Portland, Maine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1003">The '''Master of Science in Organizational Leadership''' (MSOL) is a multidisciplinary [[master's degree]] in [[leadership studies]].

It is an alternative to, not a substitute for, the traditional [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree. The MSOL degree is multidisciplinary and focuses more on people and [[organizational design|organization issues]], and relatively less on business topics such as finance, accounting and marketing. (For example, the MSOL will offer courses in psychology and philosophy as well as courses in business and management.) Also, The MSOL degree is intended for those who are already established in a career, while, in contrast, those who are preparing to enter the world of work or change careers often seek an MBA degree. 

The MSOL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Leadership]] (MSL) degree and the Masters of Organizational Leadership (MAOL).

The '''Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software''' ('''NOVAS''') is a [[software library]] for [[astrometry]]-related [[numerical analysis|numerical]] computations. It is developed by the Astronomical Applications Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]]. Currently, NOVAS has three different editions for [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Fortran]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], respectively.

==Algorithms==
The [[algorithm]]s used by NOVAS are based on vector astrometry theories and the [[IAU]] resolutions. Instead of using [[trigonometric]] formulae from spherical astrometry, NOVAS uses the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] formulation which is more rigorous. This version implements the resolutions on [[astronomical reference systems]] and Earth rotation models passed at the IAU General Assemblies in 1997, 2000, and 2006. According to the Astronomical Applications Department, the algorithms used in NOVAS are identical to those used in the production of the US part of the [[Astronomical Almanac]].&lt;ref name="novas_web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_info.php|title=NOVAS|accessdate=2015-07-16|author=Kaplan, George H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the algorithms can be found here: Kaplan, et al. (1989) ''Astron. J.'' '''97''', 1197.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaplan, George. H.|display-authors=etal|title=Mean and apparent place computations in the new IAU system. III - Apparent, topocentric, and astrometric places of planets and stars|journal=[[Astronomical Journal|Astron. J.]]|date=April 1989|volume=97|pages=1197–1210|doi=10.1086/115063|bibcode = 1989AJ.....97.1197K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The NOVAS library provides three levels of [[subroutines]] (functions): basic, utility, and supervisory.&lt;ref name="novas_web"/&gt; Basic-level subroutines supply the values of fundamental variables, such as the [[nutation]] angles and the heliocentric positions of [[solar system]] bodies for specific [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]es. Utility-level subroutines perform [[transformation (geometry)|transformations]], such as those caused by [[precession]], nutation and [[aberration of light|aberration]]. Supervisory-level subroutines serve as interfaces to the basic and utility subroutines to compute the coordinates of [[star]]s or Solar System bodies for specific dates and times.

== Usage ==
The NOVAS library can be [[Linker (computing)|linked]] by programs that work with positions of [[celestial bodies]]. For example, "Pocket Stars", an astronomy software for [[Smartphone]] and [[PDA]] platforms, used the NOVAS as its astrometry engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nomadelectronics.com/Products.aspx|accessdate=2008-08-01|title=Pocket Stars Product Versions (PDA, SP, PC)|author=Jay Alan Borseth|publisher=Nomad Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] edition allows calling the NOVAS functions from Python. It is mostly feature complete with respect to the C edition, with a few exceptions,&lt;ref name="novas_py_web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_py/novaspy_intro.php|title=NOVAS - Python|accessdate=2016-01-16|author=Kaplan, George H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares the C edition's API. The current edition uses Python's foreign function library, ctypes.

==Current status==

Future versions of the Python interface will add support for passing data via [[NumPy]] types (and therefore support vectorized operations), and present a more Pythonic interface.&lt;ref name="novas_py_announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_py/novas.pdf|title=Naval Observatory Vector AStrometry Software (NOVAS) Version 3.1, Introducing a Python Edition|accessdate=2016-01-16|author=Kaplan, George H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of [[social evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm "The Slow Birth of Agriculture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101201656/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm |date=2011-01-01 }}, [[Heather Pringle]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |title=Wizard Chemi Shanidar |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214404/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Levant]] saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, followed by sites in the wider [[Fertile Crescent]].

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005).

London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price |location=Madison |publisher=Prehistory Press |year=1992 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binford |first=Lewis R. |year=1968 |chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations |title=New Perspectives in Archaeology |editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |location=Chicago |pages=313–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]] posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by [[David Rindos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|date=December 1987|isbn=978-0125892810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.
* [[Peter Richerson]], [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]], and [[Robert Bettinger]]&lt;ref name="Richersonetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Richerson|first = Peter J.|authorlink =|year = 2001|title = Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?|journal = American Antiquity|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 387–411|doi = 10.2307/2694241|displayauthors = etal |jstor = 2694241|last2 = Boyd|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the [[Holocene]].

* The postulated [[Younger Dryas event|Younger Dryas impact event]], claimed to be in part responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafauna extinction]] and ending the last [[glacial period]], could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David G|author2=Albert C.

* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.E.

Volume 6, Number 2 / September 2007 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

[[File:Nile-River1.ogv|thumb|right|Nile River Valley, Egypt]]

On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopian highlands]], the [[Sahel]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 978-0393317558|title-link= Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast,   [[Agriculture in Egypt|Agriculture in the Nile River Valley]] is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C. A. |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; squash as early as 6000 BC, and beans by no later than 4000 BC. [[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as [[V. Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N. J., Tayles, N., Ikehara‐Quebral, R., &amp; Pietrusewsky, M. |title=From the mouths of babes: Dental caries in infants and children and the intensification of agriculture in mainland Southeast Asia |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |date=2013 |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=409–420 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22215 |pmid=23359102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

Funded voluntarily by Oklahoma's [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] producers and royalty owners, OERB conducts [[environmental restoration]] of orphaned and abandoned well sites, encourages the wise and efficient use of energy, and  promotes energy education.&lt;ref&gt;http://oerb.com/about/funding.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board is composed of 21 members. 7 members are appointed by the [[Governor of Oklahoma]], 7 are appointed by the [[President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate]], and 7 appointed by the [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]]. All members are either independent oil or natural gas producers or representatives of major oil companies that do business in Oklahoma. The Board, in turn, appoints an Executive Director to serve as the [[chief administrative officer]] of the Board.

The current board chairman is David House, president of Jireh Resources, LLC in Tulsa, OK.

OERB was created by the [[Oklahoma]] Legislature and energy industry leaders in 1993 during the term of [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[David Walters]].

==Mission==
The stated missions of the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board are:
*to educate Oklahomans about the importance of petroleum (oil and natural gas) in their lives through traditional and non-traditional school curricula, advertising, and public relations
*to environmentally restore abandoned well sites to productive land use
*to promote environmentally sound production methods and technologies
*to research and provide educational activities concerning the petroleum exploration and production industry

==Leadership==
OERB is under the leadership of the [[Oklahoma State Cabinet|Secretary of Energy]], the Chair of the Board, and the Executive Director of OERB. Under [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Mary Fallin]],  C. Michael Ming serves as Secretary, David House serves as the Chairman and Mindy Stitt serves as the Executive Director.

==Environmental restoration==
Since its creation in 1993, the OERB has committed $69 million to restore more than 11,800 abandoned and orphaned well sites as part of its [[environmental restoration]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oerb.com/restoration/environ-index.asp Well Site Cleanup&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has made restoration progress in 67 of Oklahoma's 77 counties and has a restoration budget of $6 million for the current {{when|date=June 2012}} [[fiscal year]].

Unique is OERB's funding process &amp;ndash; though it is funded by a 0.1% assessment on oil and gas sales (not uncommon among similar agencies), it is a '''''voluntary''''' assessment.  Any producer or royalty owner may opt out of the program by requesting OERB (between January 1 and March 31 of each year) for a refund of previously paid assessments.  OERB states that over 95% of participants remain in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oerb.com/Default.aspx?tabid=146|title=OERB|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxford Internet Institute Front Door.jpg|thumb|Front door of the Oxford Internet Institute on St Giles, Oxford.]]
The '''Oxford Internet Institute''' ('''OII''') is a multi-disciplinary department of social and computer science dedicated to the study of information, communication, and technology, and is part of the [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]] of the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is housed over three sites on [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles]] in [[Oxford]], including a primary site at 1 St Giles, owned by [[Balliol College]]. The department undertakes research and teaching devoted to understanding life online, with the aim of shaping [[Internet]] research, policy, and practice.

Founded in 2001, the OII has tracked the Internet's development and use, aiming to shed light on individual, collective and institutional behaviour online. The department brings together academics from a wide range of disciplines including political science, sociology, geography, economics, philosophy, physics and psychology.

Professor [[William H. Dutton]] served as Director of the OII from 2001 to 2011. Professor [[Helen Margetts]] occupied the Directorship between 2011 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/?id=580|title=Professor Helen Margetts Appointed Director of the Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=7 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Professor [[Philip N. Howard]].

== Research ==
Research at the OII covers a huge variety of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including [[privacy]] and [[Computer security|security]], [[e-government]] and [[e-democracy]], [[Virtual economy|virtual economies]], [[Smart city|smart cities]], digital exclusion, [[digital humanities]], online gaming, [[big data]] and [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]. The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: 
* Digital Politics and Government 
* Information Governance and Security 
* Social Data Science 
* [http://cii.oii.ox.ac.uk Connectivity, Inclusion and Inequality] 
* Internet Economies 
* [http://dkc.oii.ox.ac.uk Digital Knowledge and Culture]

* [http://epic.oii.ox.ac.uk Ethics and Philosophy of Information]

The faculty and students of the OII have made many advances to the study of technology and society. Director [[Helen Margetts]]' book Political Turbulence was the first book-length manuscript on the impact of social media on public life.  [[Viktor Mayer-Schönberger]]'s book Big Data was the first to define and explain the importance of big data in contemporary economics, culture, and politics.  Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] was the first political scientist to define and study [[astroturfing]] and has been responsible for significant research on fake news, bots and trolls in international affairs.  [[Luciano Floridi]] is the world's leading ethicist on AI and big data.

===Studies of Wikipedia===
OII has published several studies in Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, the Guardian Data Blog published maps of [[geotagged]] Wikipedia articles written in English, [[Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/11/wikipedia-map-world-languages | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Rogers | title=The world of Wikipedia's languages mapped | date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OII Senior Research Fellow Mark Graham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=165|title=Dr. Mark Graham|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the study and published the results on his blog, ''Zero Geography''.&lt;ref name="zerogeography"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Graham|title=Mapping Wikipedia's augmentations of our planet|url=http://www.zerogeography.net/2011/11/mapping-wikipedias-augmentations-of-our.html|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia's Networks and Geographies: Representation and Power in Peer-Produced Content|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=66|publisher=Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, OII researchers published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to "edit wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1305.5566v2|last1=Yasseri|first1=Taha|title=The most controversial topics in Wikipedia: A multilingual and geographical analysis|last2=Spoerri|first2=Anselm|last3=Graham|first3=Mark|last4=Kertész|first4=János|class=physics.soc-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of late, the OII has, amongst other things, been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the [[Big data ethics|ethics of big data]] in different contexts and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It closely collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the department for computer science and the Oxford Martin School.

== Teaching ==
Since 2006, the OII has offered a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] (doctoral) degree in "Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/teaching/dphil/|title=Oxford Internet Institute's D.

==History==
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the [[Shirley Foundation]] of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].

The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP, was quickly espoused by Colin Lucas, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol.  Two Balliol Fellows, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, approached Dame Stephanie for support.

The Oxford Internet Institute is part of a small network of research centres that includes the centres like the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and [[Information Society Project]] at Yale Law School.  But it is the only one that functions as a fully functioning, degree-granting department.

The '''Research Institute of Petroleum Industry''', also known as '''NIOC-RIPI''', often shortened to '''RIPI''' ({{lang-fa|پژوهشگاه صنعت نفت}}) is a governmental research institute founded in 1959 in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] and is affiliated with [[National Iranian Oil Company]].

The institute is a major research institute in Iran and is the largest of its kind in the Middle East. RIPI has become a major technology provider for Iran’s petroleum industry. In 2002, it developed a technology that converts heavy crude oil into the more desirable, a new generation of [[Gas to liquids|GTL]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/ipadvantage/en/details.jsp?id=2904 World Intellectual Property Organization's website, visited February 13, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Research Institute of Petroleum Industry was initially established under the title of “Iran Petroleum Industry Research Development Office” in 1959. ({{lang-fa|اداره توسعه و تحقیقات شرکت ملی نفت ایران}} ) Its primary aim was carrying out research on application of petroleum materials. After revolution of Islamic Republic of Iran, the office was changed into a center for “Research and Scientific Services”({{lang-fa|مرکز پژوهش و خدمات علمی}} ) and it has continued its activities in order to achieve the objectives. In 1989, upon the formal agreement of the development council of Department of Culture and Higher Education, the center was called “Research Institute of Petroleum Industry” and with the aim of carrying out fundamental, applied, and developmental researchers has continued doing its activities.

Strategy of PIRI is creating added value via production and commercialization of technology, with the approach of carrying out research for development of new technologies and indigenization of new technologies.

55-year history of this center in research and development and also its many extra organizational projects and effective activities in the industry have resulted in its growth over the time.  Regarding its record and history, now PIRI is known as a pioneer of developing the technologies required by the industry.

Production of valuable products such as technical knowledge, patents, and presentation of papers in reputable magazines are other brilliant activities besides its main mission; and PIRI has had excellent performance in all of them. Of course among these activities, technical knowledge and patents are more important and PIRI has done very well in these fields, too.

Existence of huge investments such as human resources, equipment and unique capabilities of  PIRI have resulted in success and high income of PIRI in activities of  technology development (industrial and semi-industrial); among unique capabilities of  PIRI  we can refer to : technical development, transfer &amp; indigenization of refinery technologies, advisory services for optimizing and solving the industries problems (petroleum industry, in particular),  giving license and designing the units which are under the license of oil and gas condensates refineries, comprehensive reservoir studies and presentation of  the field development plan, development of new technologies for solving the problem of  water, air and soil pollution, and protecting the oil facilities.  It should be mentioned that for the fourth consecutive year, PIRI has won the award on technical and engineering field.

In proclamation of supreme leader of Iran on general policies of resistive economy, there are two clauses which relate to enhancement in strategic reservoirs of oil and gas and increase in added value through completion of the value chain of gas and oil industry. PIRI is the key element in realization of these objectives. PIRI believes that the main factors in realization of these objectives are creation, development, and indigenization of required technologies in oil recovery and completion of the cycle of “science up to wealth”; thus one of the ways for reaching these goals is establishment of science-based companies.

In line with the goals of vision2025 document in which Iran is considered as a developed country occupying the first economic, scientific and technological place in the region; and by establishing an effective interaction in its international affairs, PIRI tries to reach the first scientific rank in the region. So, PIRI plays an outstanding role in realization of the vision document and even aims to realize science-based economy and international interactions.  The role of energy in Iran’s economy and increase of its consumption in the country, made PIRI develop a complete and comprehensive plan for optimization of energy consumption.

PIRI, enjoying  from efficient and expert staff and also modern technologies and equipment, mostly has aimed to produce more added value  in order to achieve macro policies of the country in realization of science-based economy as the pivotal  pillar of the resistive economy,

Relying on new management, PIRI believes that with support and cooperation of managers, universities, scientific research centers, science-based companies and experienced contractors in the area of oil and gas industry, we can take big steps towards realization of high objectives of policyholders and planners of the country. Among those high objectives, we can refer to production and optimum use of reservoirs, offer and development of new technologies and consistent progress with protecting the production resources. Therefore, PIRI warmly welcomes all powerful and capable companies’ cooperation in industrialization of domestic technologies which we have referred to some of them in this booklet.

In line with macro policies of the oil industry and employing  a new approach,  PIRI  has classified its major activities into three sections of “production and optimum use of strategic oil and gas reserves”, “ offer and development of  new technologies in industries”, and “ consistent development   and protection of resources” and they have been publicized in 19th exhibition .

The research activities of RIPI are divided into three main sections, namely “Research and development of upstream petroleum industry Research Center”, “research and development of downstream petroleum industry Research Center” and “research and development of energy and environment Research Center”.

==Staff==
'''RIPI''' has 1628 staff including 145 Ph.Ds, 458 M.Scs and 281 B.Scs.

==Sections==
RIPI has three campuses:
* Upstream Petroleum Industry - studies are in association with geology, hydrocarbon reservoir, exploration, production and petroleum engineering and field management and development are performed. 
* Downstream Petroleum Industry - studies on refinery and petrochemical processes especially catalysts synthesis and characterization, nanotechnology, gas processing and distribution and polymer synthesis.
* Energy and Environment - deals with renewable energy such as [[fuel cell]] technology and the environmental issues regarding energy conversions.

Sub-sections and faculties are included in each campus, which in turn are hosts to research groups in the fields of oil and gas.

In [[stream restoration]], [[river engineering]] or [[coastal engineering]], '''revetments''' are sloping structures placed on banks or cliffs in such a way as to absorb the energy of incoming [[water]].  In [[military engineering]] they are structures, again sloped, formed to secure an area from artillery, bombing, or stored explosives.  River or coastal revetments are usually built to preserve the existing uses of the shoreline and to protect the slope, as defense against [[erosion]].

==Freshwater revetments==

Many revetments are used to line the banks of freshwater [[rivers]], [[lake]]s, and man-made [[reservoirs]], especially to prevent damage during periods of [[floods]] or heavy seasonal rains (see [[riprap]]).  Many materials may be used: wooden piles, loose-piled boulders&lt;ref&gt;Lake Ontario Riparian Alliance.

Concrete revetments are the most common type of infrastructure used to control the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mississippi-river-infrastructure/|title=The struggle to control the Mississippi can help us understand the U.S.|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than {{Convert|1000|miles|km}} of concrete matting has been placed in river bends between [[Cairo, Illinois]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to slow the natural erosion that would otherwise frequently change small parts of the river's course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Revetments as coastal defence==
Revetments are used as a low-cost solution for coastal erosion defence in areas where crashing waves may otherwise deplete the coastline. Wooden revetments are made of planks laid against wooden frames so that they disrupt the force of the water. Although once popular, the use of wooden revetments has largely been replaced by modern concrete-based defence structures such as [[Tetrapod (structure)|tetrapods]].

==Tetrapods==
[[File:MumbaiCaltroplikeSeashoreDefence.JPG|thumb|right|{{center|Tetrapod revetment along the waterfront at [[Mumbai]]}}]]
{{main|Tetrapod (structure)}}

In coastal engineering, a tetrapod is a four-legged [[concrete]] structure used as armour unit on [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s. The tetrapod's shape is designed to dissipate the force of incoming waves by allowing water to flow around rather than against it, and to reduce displacement by allowing a random distribution of tetrapods to mutually interlock.

==Fortifications==

According to the U.S. [[National Park Service]], and referring mostly to their employment in the [[American Civil War]], a revetment is defined as a "[[retaining wall]] constructed to support the interior slope of a [[parapet]]. Made of logs, wood planks, fence rails, [[fascine]]s, [[gabion]]s, hurdles, sods, or stones, the revetment provided additional protection from enemy fire, and, most importantly, kept the interior slope nearly vertical. Stone revetments commonly survive. A few log revetments have been preserved due to high resin pine or cypress and porous sandy soils. After an [[Fortification|entrenchment]] was abandoned, many log or rail revetments were scavenged for other uses, causing the interior slope to slump more quickly.  An interior slope will appear more vertical if the parapet eroded with the revetment still in place."&lt;ref name=NPS-MILITARY-EARTHWORK-TERMS&gt;{{cite web

The '''Schmidt Ocean Institute''' is a non-profit [[private foundation]] focused on [[oceanography]], founded in March 2009 by [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Wendy Schmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2010_audited_financial_statement.pdf | publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAG"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/life-after-google-eric-schmidts-60-million-ocean-adventure-2011-2?op=1 |title = LIFE AFTER GOOGLE: Eric Schmidt's $60 Million Ocean Adventure, |author = TheoDP |date = 15 Feb 2011 |work = Businessinsider.com. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute’s goal is to advance ocean exploration, discovery, and knowledge using technological advances, data-rich observation and analysis, and open sharing of information.

The Schmidt Ocean Institute, which was previously known as the Schmidt Research Vessel Institute, has been awarded grants from the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]] for the purpose of owning and operating scientific [[research vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation 2009 IRS Form 990-PF |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2009_TSF_Foundation_990_PF.pdf  |publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research vessels==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has operated two research vessels, RV ''Lone Ranger'' and RV ''Falkor''.

''Lone Ranger'', a 255-foot former ocean tug, was donated to the Institute by [[Peter B. Lewis]] in 2009 and was operated by the Institute in various Atlantic Ocean research cruises.&lt;ref name="LAG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute website |title = Sargasso Sea research expedition equipment |url = http://www.mbari.org/expeditions/Sargasso/equip.htm |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lone Ranger'' was decommissioned from the Schmidt Ocean Institute scientific fleet in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Previous Ship, Lone Ranger |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/65 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lone Ranger's'' successor is RV ''Falkor'', a 272-foot former German fisheries protection vessel purchased from the German government in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Field Trials 2012 |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/713 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2012, ''Falkor'' underwent an extensive refit at the Peters Schiffbau shipyard in Germany to convert it into a globally capable oceanographic research vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Specifications |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/47 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Refit |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/80 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Germany: Peters Schiffbau Shipyard Completes RV FALKOR's Refit Project |url = http://shipbuildingtribune.com/2012/04/23/germany-peters-schiffbau-shipyard-completes-rv-falkors-refit-project/ |date = 23 April 2012 |work = Shipbuildingtribune.com |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refit cost $60 million, and in addition to its own equipment, ''Falkor'' will at times also carry equipment from other oceanographic organizations, such as the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]’s [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus underwater vehicle]], for exploring the [[Mariana Trench]].&lt;ref name="Witze"&gt;{{cite news |title = Private research ship makes waves |url=http://www.nature.com/news/private-research-ship-makes-waves-1.12680 |author = Alexandra Witze |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research proposals for time aboard ''Falkor'' are peer reviewed by independent scientists. Program managers favor [[open data]] projects, but data sharing is not a requirement. If a project is accepted, the ship time is free to the researchers, but they must find additional funding for their salaries and post-cruise science.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat"&gt;{{cite news |title = Push the boat out |url=http://www.nature.com/news/push-the-boat-out-1.12669 |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Falkor'' is intended to be a long-term global resource, integrating the latest technology into ocean exploration. Schmidt Ocean Institute program managers have encouraged scientists from around the world to apply for ship time; although the first cruises scheduled will be led by US and Canadian researchers, researchers from 23 countries applied in the most recent round of research proposals.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat" /&gt;

==Activities and expeditions==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has undertaken multiple research projects in collaboration with organizations including the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]], the [[Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping|Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center]], [[IFREMER]], the Center for Environmental Visualization, the Marine Science and Technology Foundation, and various universities and oceanographic research institutions.

Schmidt Ocean Institute researchers and research vessels have studied remote [[coral reef]] conditions at the [[Kiritimati|Kiritimati atoll]], [[deep-water coral]] habitats using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]], Atlantic marine pollutants and [[biofuel]] candidates in the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] and [[Sargasso Sea]], and the long-term effects of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Projects |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/science |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Expeditions |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/expeditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a team aboard RV ''Falkor'' started conducting a multibeam mapping survey of the Campeche Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico, which may provide insight into geological records for the [[Chicxulub crater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Imaging the K-T Boundary |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/1453 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During field trials in July 2012 of the multibeam [[echo sounding]] equipment on RV ''Falkor'', the team aboard discovered the wreck of lost polar expedition ship ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'' off the southern coast of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Scott's wrecked ship Terra Nova found off Greenland |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19288188 |author = Paul Rincon |date = 16 August 2012 |work = BBC News. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

==Voices==
[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |title=Singing
 |work=[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Music/|title=Ancient Greek Music|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include [[vocal coaches]], [[choral music|choral directors]], [[Music education|vocal music educators]], [[List of opera directors|opera directors]], and other teachers of singing.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000).

Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14104">The '''system size expansion''', also known as '''van Kampen's expansion''' or the '''Ω-expansion''', is a technique pioneered by [[Nico van Kampen]]&lt;ref name = "vankampen"&gt;van Kampen, N. G. (2007) "Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry", North-Holland Personal Library&lt;/ref&gt; used in the analysis of [[stochastic processes]]. Specifically, it allows one to find an approximation to the solution of a [[master equation]] with nonlinear transition rates. The leading order term of the expansion is given by the '''linear noise approximation''', in which the master equation is approximated by a [[Fokker–Planck equation]] with linear coefficients determined by the [[Markov process|transition rates]] and [[stoichiometry]] of the system.

Less formally, it is normally straightforward to write down a mathematical description of a system where processes happen randomly (for example, radioactive atoms randomly [[Radioactive decay|decay]] in a physical system, or genes that are [[cellular noise|expressed stochastically]] in a cell). However, these mathematical descriptions are often too difficult to solve for the study of the systems statistics (for example, the [[Mean (statistics)|mean]] and [[variance]] of the number of atoms or proteins as a function of time). The system size expansion allows one to obtain an approximate statistical description that can be solved much more easily than the master equation.

== Preliminaries ==

Systems that admit a treatment with the system size expansion may be described by a [[probability distribution]] &lt;math&gt;P(X, t)&lt;/math&gt;, giving the probability of observing the system in state &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be, for example, a [[Tuple|vector]] with elements corresponding to the number of molecules of different chemical species in a system. In a system of size &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (intuitively interpreted as the volume), we will adopt the following nomenclature: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of macroscopic copy numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{X}/\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of concentrations, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of deterministic concentrations, as they would appear according to the rate equation in an infinite system. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; are thus quantities subject to stochastic effects.

A [[master equation]] describes the time evolution of this probability.&lt;ref name = "vankampen" /&gt; Henceforth, a system of chemical reactions&lt;ref name = "elf"&gt;Elf, J. and Ehrenberg, M. (2003) "Fast Evaluation of Fluctuations in Biochemical Networks With the Linear Noise Approximation", ''Genome Research'', 13:2475–2484.&lt;/ref&gt; will be discussed to provide a concrete example, although the nomenclature of "species" and "reactions" is generalisable. A system involving &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; species and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; reactions can be described with the master equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d P(\mathbf{X}, t)}{dt} = \Omega \sum_{j = 1}^R \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}} - 1 \right) f_j (\mathbf{x}, \Omega) P (\mathbf{X}, t). &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the system size, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] which will be addressed later, &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the stoichiometric matrix for the system (in which element &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometry_matrix|stoichiometric coefficient]] for species &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; given a state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and system size &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; is a step operator,&lt;ref name = "vankampen" /&gt; removing &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th element of its argument. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^{-S_{23}} f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f(x_1, x_2 - S_{23}, x_3)&lt;/math&gt;. This formalism will be useful later.

The above equation can be interpreted as follows. The initial sum on the RHS is over all reactions. For each reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the brackets immediately following the sum give two terms. The term with the simple coefficient −1 gives the probability flux away from a given state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; due to reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; changing the state. The term preceded by the product of step operators gives the probability flux due to reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; changing a different state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X'}&lt;/math&gt; into state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The product of step operators constructs this state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X'}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example ===

For example, consider the (linear) chemical system involving two chemical species &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; and the reaction &lt;math&gt;X_1 \rightarrow X_2&lt;/math&gt;. In this system, &lt;math&gt;N = 2&lt;/math&gt; (species), &lt;math&gt;R = 1&lt;/math&gt; (reactions). A state of the system is a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \{ n_1, n_2 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2&lt;/math&gt; are the number of molecules of &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Let &lt;math&gt;f_1(\mathbf{x}, \Omega) = \frac{n_1}{\Omega} = x_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the rate of reaction 1 (the only reaction) depends on the concentration of &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;. The stoichiometry matrix is &lt;math&gt;(-1, 1)^T&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the master equation reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac{d P(\mathbf{X}, t)}{dt} &amp; = \Omega \left( \mathbb{E}^{-S_{11}} \mathbb{E}^{-S_{21}} - 1 \right) f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\Omega} \right) P(\mathbf{X}, t) \\
&amp; = \Omega \left( f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{\Delta X}}{\Omega} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{\Delta X}, t \right)  - f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\Omega} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}, t \right) \right),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta X} = \{1, -1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the shift caused by the action of the product of step operators, required to change state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; to a precursor state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Linear noise approximation ==

If the master equation possesses [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] transition rates, it may be impossible to solve it analytically. The system size expansion utilises the [[ansatz]] that the [[variance]] of the steady-state probability distribution of constituent numbers in a population scales like the system size. This ansatz is used to expand the master equation in terms of a small parameter given by the inverse system size.

Specifically, let us write the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, the copy number of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, as a sum of its "deterministic" value (a scaled-up concentration) and a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, scaled by &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; X_i = \Omega \phi_i + \Omega^{1/2} \xi_i. &lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; can then be rewritten in the vector of random variables &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; P(\mathbf{X}, t) = P(\Omega \mathbf{\phi} + \Omega^{1/2} \mathbf{\xi}) = \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t). &lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider how to write reaction rates &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the step operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of this new random variable. [[Taylor expansion]] of the transition rates gives:

:&lt;math&gt; f_j (\mathbf{x}) = f_j (\mathbf{\phi} + \Omega^{-1/2} \mathbf{\xi}) = f_j( \mathbf{\phi} ) + \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial f_j(\mathbf{\phi})}{\partial \phi_i} \xi_i + O(\Omega^{-1}). &lt;/math&gt;

The step operator has the effect &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} f(n) \rightarrow f(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} f(\xi) \rightarrow f(\xi + \Omega^{-1/2})&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}} \simeq 1 - \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i S_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{\Omega^{-1}}{2} \sum_i \sum_k S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} + O(\Omega^{-3/2}). &lt;/math&gt;

We are now in a position to recast the master equation.

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} &amp; {} \quad \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} - \Omega^{1/2} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i} \\
&amp; = \Omega \sum_{j = 1}^R \left( -\Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i S_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{\Omega^{-1}}{2} \sum_i \sum_k S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} + O(\Omega^{-3/2}) \right) \\
&amp; {} \qquad \times \left( f_j(\mathbf{\phi}) + \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i \frac{\partial f_j(\mathbf{\phi})}{\partial \phi_i} \xi_i + O(\Omega^{-1}) \right) \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This rather frightening expression makes a bit more sense when we gather terms in different powers of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. First, terms of order &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; give

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i} = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}) \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i}. &lt;/math&gt;

These terms cancel, due to the [[Rate equation|macroscopic reaction equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}). &lt;/math&gt;

The terms of order &lt;math&gt;\Omega^0&lt;/math&gt; are more interesting:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} = \sum_j \left( \sum_{ik} -S_{ij} \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial \phi_k} \frac{\partial (\xi_k \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t) )}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{1}{2} f_j \sum_{ik} S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2 \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} = -\sum_{ik} A_{ik} \frac{\partial (\xi_k \Pi)}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ik} [\mathbf{BB}^T]_{ik} \frac{\partial^2 \Pi}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k}, &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ik} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial \phi_k} = \frac{\partial (\mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{f})}{\partial \phi_k}, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; [ \mathbf{BB}^T ]_{ik} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij}S_{kj} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}) = [ \mathbf{S} \, \mbox{diag}(f(\mathbf{\phi})) \, \mathbf{S}^T ]_{ik}. &lt;/math&gt;

The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is then governed by the linear [[Fokker–Planck equation]] with coefficient matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{BB}^T&lt;/math&gt; (in the large-&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; limit, terms of &lt;math&gt;O(\Omega^{-1/2})&lt;/math&gt; may be neglected, termed the '''linear noise approximation'''). With knowledge of the reaction rates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; and stoichiometry &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the moments of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated.

The linear noise approximation has become a popular technique for estimating the size of [[Cellular noise|intrinsic noise]] in terms of [[Coefficient of variation|coefficients of variation]] and [[Fano factor]]s for molecular species in intracellular pathways. The second moment obtained from the linear noise approximation (on which the noise measures are based) are exact only if the pathway is composed of first-order reactions. However bimolecular reactions such as [[Enzyme kinetics|enzyme-substrate]], [[Protein-protein interaction|protein-protein]] and [[Protein-DNA interaction|protein-DNA]] interactions are ubiquitous elements of all known pathways; for such cases, the linear noise approximation can give estimates which are accurate in the limit of large reaction volumes. Since this limit is taken at constant concentrations, it follows that the linear noise approximation gives accurate results in the limit of large molecule numbers and becomes less reliable for pathways characterized by many species with low copy numbers of molecules. 

A number of studies have elucidated cases of the insufficiency of the linear noise approximation in biological contexts by comparison of its predictions with those of stochastic simulations.&lt;ref name="hayot"&gt;Hayot, F. and Jayaprakash, C. (2004), "The linear noise approximation for molecular fluctuations within cells", ''Physical Biology'', 1:205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ferm"&gt;Ferm, L. Lötstedt, P. and Hellander, A. (2008), "A Hierarchy of Approximations of the Master Equation Scaled by a Size Parameter", ''Journal of Scientific Computing'', 34:127&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the investigation of higher order terms of the system size expansion that go beyond the linear approximation. These terms have been used to obtain more accurate moment estimates for the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] concentrations and for the [[variance]]s of the concentration fluctuations in intracellular pathways. In particular, the leading order corrections to the linear noise approximation yield corrections of the conventional [[rate equation]]s.&lt;ref name = "grima2010"&gt;Grima, R. (2010) "An effective rate equation approach to reaction kinetics in small volumes: Theory and application to biochemical reactions in nonequilibrium steady-state conditions", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 132:035101&lt;/ref&gt; Terms of higher order have also been used to obtain corrections to the [[variance]]s and [[covariance]]s estimates of the linear noise approximation.&lt;ref name="grima2011"&gt;Grima, R. and Thomas, P. and Straube, A.V. (2011), "How accurate are the nonlinear chemical Fokker-Planck and chemical Langevin equations?", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 135:084103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grima2012"&gt;Grima, R. (2012), "A study of the accuracy of moment-closure approximations for stochastic chemical kinetics", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 136: 154105&lt;/ref&gt; The linear noise approximation and corrections to it can be computed using the open source software [[intrinsic Noise Analyzer]]. The corrections have been shown to be particularly considerable for [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric]] and non-allosteric enzyme-mediated reactions in [[Cellular compartment|intracellular compartments]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15966">'''TNP-ATP''' is a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[molecule]] that is able to determine whether or not a [[protein]] binds to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and the constants associated with that binding. It is primarily used in [[fluorescence]] [[spectroscopy]], but is also very useful as an acceptor molecule in [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]], and as a fluorescent [[Fluorophore|probe]] in fluorescence [[microscopy]] and [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[File:TNP BINDING.jpg|thumb|TNP BINDING]]

== Constituent parts ==
TNP refers to the [[chemical compound]] 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, also known as [[Picric acid]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Xiang |last2=Huang |first2=Xiaomei |last3=Wu |first3=Di |date=June 2015 |title=Förster Resonance-energy-transfer Detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol Using Copper Nanoclusters |journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry |volume=407 |issue=16 |pages=4607–4613 |doi=10.1007/s00216-015-8657-7 |pmid=25893800}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary constituent of many unexploded landmines, and is a cousin to [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], but less stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is recognized as an environmental contaminant and is [[Toxicity|toxic]] to many organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is still commonly used in the manufacturing of [[fireworks]], [[explosives]], and [[rocket fuels]], as well as in leather, pharmaceutical, and dye industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is an essential mediator of life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fluorescent and colored trinitrophenylated analogs of ATP and GTP |last=Hiratsuka |first=Toshiaki |date=February 2003 |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=270 |issue=17 |pages=3479–3485 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x |pmid=12919312 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x/asset/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to overcome unfavorable energy barriers to initiate and fuel chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also used to drive biological machinery and regulate a number of processes via protein-[[phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the proteins that bind ATP for both regulation and [[Enzymatic hydrolysis|enzymatic]] reactions are very diverse—many yet undiscovered—and for many proteins their relationship to ATP in terms of number of [[binding site]]s, [[binding constant]]s, and [[dissociation constant]]s remain unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== TNP-ATP ==
Conjugating TNP to ATP renders this nucleotide triphosphate fluorescent and colored whilst allowing it to retain its biological activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; TNP-ATP is thus a  [[Fluorophore|fluorescent]] [[Substrate analog|analog]] of ATP.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fujita |first1=Suguru |last2=Nawata |first2=Tomoko |last3=Yamada |first3=Kazuhiro |date=March 1999 |title=Fluorescence Changes of a Label Attached near the Myosin Active Site on Nucleotide Binding in Rat Skeletal Muscle Fibres |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=515 |issue=3 |pages=869–880 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.869ab.x |issn=1469-7793 |pmc=2269193 |pmid=10066911}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conjugation is very useful in providing information about interactions between ATP and an ATP-binding protein because TNP-ATP interacts with proteins and enzymes as a substitute for its parent nucleotide, and has a strong binding affinity for most systems that require ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TNP is [[Excited state|excited]] at a [[wavelength]] of 408 and 470&amp;nbsp;nm, and [[Fluorescence|fluoresces]] in the 530–560&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiratsuka |first1=T. |last2=Uchida |date=October 1973 |first2=K. |title=Preparation and Properties of 2′(or 3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) Adenosine 5′-triphosphate, an Analog of Adenosine Triphosphate |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=320 |issue=3 |pages=635–47 |doi=10.1016/0304-4165(73)90143-8 |pmid=4270904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guarnieri |first1=Michael T. |last2=Blagg |first2=Brian S.

Thus, with enhanced fluorescence, it can be seen whether or not a protein binds to ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When TNP-ATP in water is excited at 410&amp;nbsp;nm, TNP-ATP shows a single fluorescence maximum at 561&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This maximum shifts as the fluid's viscosity changes. For example, in [[Dimethylformamide|N,N-dimethylformamide]], instead of having its maxima at 561&amp;nbsp;nm as in water, the maxima is instead at 533&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Binding to a protein will also change the wavelength of maximal emission, as well as a change in fluorescent intensity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, binding to the [[chemotaxis]] protein CheA indicates a severalfold enhancement of fluorescence intensity and a blue-shift in wavelength of the maximal emission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Using this TNP nucleotide analog has been shown in many instances to be superior to traditional [[Nucleotide|radionucleotide-labelling]] based techniques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The health concerns and the cost associated with the use of radioactive [[isotope]]s makes TNP-ATP an attractive alternative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first fluorescent [[ribose]]-modified ATP is 2’,3’-O-(2,4,7-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene) adenosine 5’triphosphate (TNP-ATP), and was introduced in 1973 by Hiratsuka and Uchida.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  TNP-ATP was originally synthesized to investigate the ATP binding site of [[myosin ATPase]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Reports of TNP-ATP’s success in the investigation of this motor protein extended TNP-ATP’s use to other proteins and enzymes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; TNP-ATP has now been used as a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] probe for numerous proteins suspected to have ATP interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These include several protein [[kinase]]s, [[ATPase]]s, [[myosin]], and other nucleotide binding proteins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over the past twenty years, there have been hundreds of papers describing TNP-ATP’s use and applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many applications involving this fluorescently labeled nucleotide have helped to clarify structure-function relationships of many ATP-requiring proteins and enzymes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There have also been a growing number of papers that display TNP-ATP use as a means of assessing the ATP-binding capacity of various mutant proteins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Preparation ==
Preparing TNP-ATP is a one-step synthesis that is relatively safe and easy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adenosine’s ribose moiety can be trinitrophenylated by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonate ([[2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid|TNBS]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The resulting compound assumes a bright orange color and has visible absorption characteristics, as is characteristic of a [[Meisenheimer complex|Meiseinheimer spiro complex compound linking]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

To see the exact method of preparion, please refer to T. Hiratsuka's and K. Uchida's paper ''"Preparation and Properties of 2'(r 3')-O(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) Adenosine 5'-triphosphate, an Analog of Adenosine Triphosphate,"''  found in the reference section.

To revert TNP-ATP back to its constituent parts, or in other words to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] TNP-ATP to give equilmolar amounts of picric acid (TNP) and ATP, TNP-ATP should be treated with 1 M [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] at 100 degrees Celsius for 1.5 hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is because if TNP-ATP is acidified under mild conditions, it results in the opening of the [[dioxolane]] ring attached to the 2’-oxygen, leaving a 3’O-TNP derivative as the only product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Storage ==
TNP-ATP should be stored at −20 degrees Celsius, in the dark, and used under minimal lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When in solution, TNP-ATP has a shelf-life of about 30 days.

== pKa and Isosbestic Point ==
When absorption was measured against wavelength at various pH values, the changes at wavelength 408&amp;nbsp;nm and 470&amp;nbsp;nm yielded a [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] line with a midpoint at 5.1.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This indicated that the absorbance at these two wavelengths depends upon the ionization of the [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] portion of TNP-ATP and is unaffected by ionization of ATP.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although this [[ionization]] constant of 5.1 is not in physiological range, it has been shown that the absorbance of TNP-ATP is sensitive enough to detect changes due to slight shifts in neutral pH.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] superposition indicated TNP-ATP’s [[Isosbestic point|isosbestic]] point to be 339&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Constants and calculations ==
At low concentrations of TNP-ATP (≤1&amp;nbsp;μM), fluorescent intensity is proportional to the concentration of TNP added.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, at concentrations exceeding 1&amp;nbsp;μM, inner filter effects cause this relationship to no longer be linear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To correct this, researchers must determine the ratio of the predicted theoretical fluorescence intensity (assuming linearity) to the observed fluorescence intensity and then apply this correction factor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in most cases, researchers will try to keep the concentration of TNP to lower than 1&amp;nbsp;μM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

To determine binding affinities, TNP-ATP is added to a solution and then titrated with protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This produces a saturation curve from which the binding affinity can be determined.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The number of binding sites may also be determined through this saturation curve by looking to see if there are sudden changes in slope.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One can also [[Titration|titrate]] a fixed amount of protein with increasing additions of TNP-ATP to obtain a saturation curve.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To do so, however, may get complicated due to the inner filter effects that will need to be corrected for.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

To determine dissociation constants, TNP-ATP can be competed off of a protein with ATP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The value of the dissociation constant K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; for a single-site binding can then be obtained by applying the [[Langmuir adsorption model|Langmuir equation]] for a curve fit:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} = \mathrm{RFU_{free}} + \frac{(\mathrm{RFU_{bound}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}) \times \left( (\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \mathrm{K_d}) - \sqrt{(\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \mathrm{K_d})^2 - (4 \times \mathrm{[protein]_{total}} \times \mathrm{[TNP]})} \right)}{2 \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where RFU is relative fluorescent units, RFU&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence observed, RFU&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence of free TNP-ATP, and RFU&lt;sub&gt;bound&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence of TNP-ATP when completely bound to a protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

To measure an ATP competitor, one can add competitor to pre-incubated samples of protein:TNP-ATP. The fraction of TNP-ATP bound to the protein can be calculated via:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}}{\mathrm{RFU_{max}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is that fraction, and RFU&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of fluorescence intensity at saturation, meaning when 100% of TNP-ATP is bound.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The dissociation constants for TNP and competitor can then be calculated through the equation:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{[TNP]} \times \left( \mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \frac{\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \times \mathrm{[competitor]} + \mathrm{[TNP]} + \mathrm{[protein]} - \sqrt{\left( \mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \frac{\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \times \mathrm{[competitor]} + \mathrm{[TNP]} + \mathrm{[protein]}\right)^2 - 4 \times \mathrm{[TNP]} \times \mathrm{[protein]}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For reasons not yet fully understood, TNP-ATP typically binds the ATP binding sites of proteins and enzymes anywhere from one to three times tighter than regular ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dissociation constants are usually around 0.3–50&amp;nbsp;μM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Other uses ==
In addition to using TNP-ATP to determine whether or not a protein binds ATP, its binding affinity and dissociation constants, and number of binding sites, TNP-ATP can also be used in ligand binding studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To do this, titrations of the protein are added to TNP-ATP. Then, ligand is added to displace the bound analog.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is measured by decreases in fluorescence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One can also do this by titrating protein with TNP-ATP in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of the ligand of interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using either experiment will allow the binding affinity of the ligand to protein to be measured.

TNP-ATP is also valuable fluorescence acceptor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because, as with any good acceptor, TNP-ATP absorbs over a wide wavelength range that corresponds to the range of emission of common [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] donors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, TNP-ATP can be used to look at the conformational changes that proteins undergo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, Na+/K+ ATPase, the distance between the active site and Cys457 was shown to change from 25 Angstroms to 28 Angstroms in changing from the Na+ conformation to the K+ conformation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to fluorescent spectroscopy, TNP-ATP is very useful in fluorescent [[microscopy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is because it greatly increases the sensitivity of the observations when bound to proteins—the enhanced fluorescence greatly reduces the problem of background fluorescence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is especially true under [[Epifluorescence microscopy|epifluorescent]] illumation (illumination and light are both on the same side of the specimen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TNP-ATP has also been used in [[X-ray crystallography]] because it can be used to determine binding constants of crystallized substrates. This technique also demonstrates the structure of proteins in the presence or absence of TNP-ATP, which may or may not correspond to the structure of proteins when they bind ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Terrorism Research Centre LOGO.jpg|thumb|right|TRC Logo]]
The '''Terrorism Research Center (TRC)''' is non-profit [[think tank]] focused on investigating and researching global [[terrorism]] issues through multi-disciplinary collaboration amongst a group of international experts.

== History 1996 to 2012==
The TRC was founded in 1996 by Matthew Devost, Brian Houghton, and Neal Pollard to establish an organization with a specific focus on terrorism and emerging international security issues like [[information warfare]].  It was purchased by [[Academi|Blackwater]]'s [[Erik Prince]] in 2007.  Over the course of 14 years, the TRC conducted research, analysis, and training on variety of [[Counter-terrorism|counterterrorism]] and [[homeland security]] issues.

The TRC web site (which operated at www.terrorism.com since 1996 and then also mirrored at www.homelandsecurity.com starting in 2000) was the top search engine result for “terrorism” and other security keywords for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrorism.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The site regularly received as many as 5,000,000 hits per month and had tens of thousands of active registered users.  The site has also been cited in thousands of books, news articles, academic papers, and other works.

== Major projects (1996 to 2012) ==
The TRC was involved in several major projects, from 1996:&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.terrorism.org/historic-projects/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/02/AR2007110202165_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Responder Knowledge Base.
* Terrorism Early Warning Group Expansion Project.
* Mirror Image Training.
* RealNews List.
* Project Pediatric Preparedness.
* Lecture Series.

===Responder Knowledge Base===
The TRC conceived, prototyped, designed, built and operated the RKB over a period of six years.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  The RKB provided emergency responders, purchasers, and planners with a trusted, integrated, online source of information on products, standards, certifications, grants, and other equipment-related information. The RKB was operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from 2008 until it was decommissioned in September 2013.

===Terrorism Early Warning Group Expansion Project===
The TRC has worked with the Los Angeles Terrorism Early Warning (TEW) Group since 1997.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://file.lacounty.gov/lasd/cms1_144939.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The TRC and [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) submitted a grant application to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism to expand the Terrorism Early Warning Group concept to six high threat cities in the U.S.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  The Terrorism Early Warning Group concept fulfills the intelligence requirements outlined in Homeland Security Directive 8: Interim National Preparedness Goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devost.net/2005/06/13/utilizing-terrorism-early-warning-groups-to-meet-the-national-preparedness-goal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrorism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TEW_and_National_Preparedness_Goal-TRC-May2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the formation of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], the Terrorism Early Warning Group program was migrated to DHS and expanded to cover 56 high threat urban areas.  The TRC worked with these 56 cities to develop early warning and intelligence centers that became the precursor the national Fusion Center network.

===Mirror Image training===
The TRC developed the renowned Mirror Image training program in 2001 to allow military, intelligence, security and first responder personnel to better understand the international terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ooda.com/mirror-image-training/&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants were subjected to an intense immersion program where they were trained to think and act like the adversary and adopt their tactics, techniques, and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/10558/&lt;/ref&gt;  TRC Mirror Image training became a U.S. Army Foundry course, was featured in major news media, and became the most popular training course the TRC ever developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devost.net/2005/05/20/mirror-image-on-cnn/&lt;/ref&gt;

===RealNews List===
The TRC provided a free daily [[news clipping]] service on a variety of global security issues.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  An archive of several hundred thousand clippings was available via the TRC web site. The mailing of the TRC free daily news clipping service, became known as the 'early bird of global risk issues'.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Project Pediatric Preparedness===
The TRC 'Project Pediatric Preparedness' report responded to emergency preparedness and response planning, technology investments, and training frequently, in respect to the unique requirements of responding to pediatric victims of a larger scale terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riskintel.com/reference-library/?did=647&lt;/ref&gt;
The project explained these unique needs and gaps, and provided a foundation for homeland security planning for pediatric victims of terrorism. The final report described the minimum capabilities essential for emergency response to pediatric victims.&lt;ref name=repfin&gt;http://www.terrorism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PPP_Report_Final_4-11-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report laid out fifteen Functional Areas for pediatric response – general areas describing functions, tasks, and missions of emergency response. This report is available on the TRC website.&lt;ref name=repfin/&gt;

===Lecture series===
The TRC developed a lecture series, that brought together a wide array of experts to discuss emerging threats.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  These lectures were then released as audio downloads on the site.  Popular speakers from the lecture series included [[Brian Michael Jenkins]], [[Rohan Gunaratna]], and Hekmat Karzai.

== 2005 U.S. Capitol flag honor ==
In 2005, to honor of TRC’s contributions to the first responder community through the development of the RKB system, it received a U.S. flag that had been flown over the U.S. Capitol building (one of more than 100,000 such flags flown annually).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capitol Flags|{{cite web |url=http://www.capitolflags.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155842/http://www.capitolflags.gov/ |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today==
Early in 2009, none of the TRC founders were still involved with the center.  The Terrorism Research Center ceased operations in 2010 at the discretion of new owners and managers.&lt;br /&gt;
In April 2012, the founders of the TRC announced it was being reconstituted as a non-profit at www.terrorism.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2012/04/20/Counter-terror-think-tank-goes-non-profit/UPI-41581334935744/&lt;/ref&gt; The new focus was on sponsoring research publications, and facilitating research. In December 2014, the TRC was included as a collaborating partner with the Microsimulation &amp; Risk Modelling Group at the [[University of Wollongong]]. The project with them is assessing the tactics and counter tactics involved in lone wolf knife attacks on the public.&lt;ref&gt;Microsimulation &amp; Risk Modelling Group (University of Wollongong), Collaborating Partners, International Partners https://uow-mrmg.github.io/collaboration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012-2013 publications ===
The Terrorism Research Center has initiated sponsorship of new publications in terrorism, and related research areas. The main focus has been research into [[Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures]] by its research associates, such as Dr. [[Robert J. Bunker]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Robert-J.-Bunker/e/B0088PBTYA/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_1&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Chris Flaherty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christopher-James-Flaherty/e/B001K880TO/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_7?qid=1378463748&amp;sr=1-7&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012-2014 Terrorism Research Center sponsored publications:

'''''(Documents Relating to) The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire''''' is a 1983 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fifth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises a set of documents that describe the final days of the Volyen Empire, located at the edge of our galaxy and under the influence of three other galactic empires, the benevolent [[Canopus]], the tyrannical [[Sirius]], and the malicious Shammat of Puttiora. It was first published in the United States in March 1983 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in May 1983 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' is a social satire written in the tradition of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[George Orwell]],&lt;ref name=Kakutani&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE4DF1539F937A25750C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |authorlink=Michiko Kakutani |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=14 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the debasement of language in [[rhetoric|political rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EED61039F930A35757C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Against Galactic Rhetoric |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Edward  |last=Rothstein |authorlink=Edward Rothstein |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=3 April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lessing's [[fictional universe]] it is propaganda that keeps the fragile empires afloat, and when language becomes too distorted, some of her characters succumb to a condition called "undulant rhetoric" and are placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=pp. 11 &amp; 15}}

Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, this book is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} While ''The Sentimental Agents'' can be read as a stand-alone book, Lessing does continue with the history of the Sirian Empire, picking up from where she left off in ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980), the third book in the ''Canopus'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994b}}{{sfn|Lessing|1994c}}

==Reception==
[[Edward Rothstein]] in a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes ''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' as "a satirical romp through rhetoric in a foreign empire", but complains that the tone of the book "wavers uncertainly, mixing farce, cynicism and banal religiosity."&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;

In another New York Times review, [[Michiko Kakutani]] writes that in this book Lessing has "narrowed her cosmic focus to a specific issue, namely the manipulative use of language and words" which, she believes, was handled with "more acerbity and more humour" by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name=Kakutani/&gt;

==Plot==
The Volyen Empire is a relatively weak interstellar empire situated at the edge of our galaxy.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 13}} It comprises the planet Volyen, its two moons, Volyenadna and Volyendesta (also referred to as planets), and two neighbouring planets, Maken and Slovin.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 12}} Intelligent life evolved independently on each of these five "planets", and over time unstable empires formed, where each planet for a period ruled the others. The Volyen Empire is the last of these empires and rules the region with force and repression.

Although this system is at the edge of the Canopean Empire's sphere of influence, Canopus sends agents to the region because Volyen's colonisation of Maken and Slovin provoked the Sirian Empire who had earmarked these planets for "possible expansion". In addition, Shammat, Canopus's enemy, had established a presence in the region.

Disillusioned and oppressed, the citizens of Volyen and its colonies start speaking out against the Volyen government. Revolutionary groups form and counter the Empire's rhetoric with rhetoric of their own. Krolgul of Shammat, buoyed by the turmoil, encourages anti-government behaviour. Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, is sent to Volyen to observe the unfolding events, and to monitor Incent, one of his agents who has been caught up in the sentiment of the revolutionary rhetoric. Incent has also fallen prey to Krolgul's propaganda and is withdrawn from the field by Klorathy and placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases on Volyendesta.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 15}}

Sirius is now threatening to invade the region, and this is welcomed by the downtrodden in the Volyen Empire because they are sure that Sirius will set them free. Many citizens became Sirian agents and provide Sirius with information and support. But the Sirian Empire is itself in turmoil. A conflict on Sirius split the governing oligarchy into the Questioners, led by the Five who want Sirius's expansion program halted, and the Conservers, who believe Sirius should continue colonising other planets.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.14}} The Five were defeated and Sirius resumed its expansion, but this time with an uncontrolled brutality that turned the Sirian Empire into a tyranny. When the Sirian agents learn about Sirius's tyranny, their loyalties are divided between Sirius and Volyen, and they become known as "sentimental agents".{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.190}}

Sirius invades the Volyen Empire with troops from nearby Sirian occupied planets. The troops, themselves colonial subjects of the now declining Sirian Empire, were told that Volyen is poor and deprived and needs Sirius's help. But when they land they discover that the Volyens are better off than they are, and return home and declare their own planets independent from Sirius. Volyenadna and Volyendesta, with Klorathy's help, become self-sustaining and declare ''their'' independence from the crumbling Volyen Empire.

The change of circumstances in the region weakens Krolgul and his influence, and he returns to Shammat. Incent, now "recovered" from his illness, decides that he is going to help Krolgul. Klorathy, still Incent's custodian, follows him to Shammat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">'''Ultra-high vacuum''' ('''UHV''') is the [[vacuum]] regime characterised by [[pressure]]s lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] or 100 nanopascals (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[milli|m]][[Bar (unit)|bar]], ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the [[mean free path]] of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km, so the gas is in [[free molecular flow]], and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. [[Surface science]] experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted [[Adsorption|adsorbates]]. Surface analysis tools such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] and [[low energy ion scattering]] require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] are kept at UHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100&amp;nbsp;°C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which [[adsorption|adsorb]] on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon "cycling" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an "interlock" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a "puff" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: "through-gassing"):
* Majority of [[organic compounds]] cannot be used:
** [[Plastics]], other than [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]]: [[gasket]]s are made of copper, and are single-use; plastics in other uses are replaced with [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] or metals.  Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as [[Viton]]) and perfluoroelastomers (such as [[Kalrez]]) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive.
** [[Glue]]s: special glues for high vacuum must be used.
* Some [[steels]]: due to oxidization of [[carbon steel]], which greatly increases adsorption area, only [[stainless steel]] is used.  Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] grades such as [[304 stainless steel|304]] and [[316 stainless steel|316]] are preferred.  These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel.  Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as [[304L]] and [[316L]]), and grades with additives such as [[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]] to reduce the formation of [[chromium carbide]] (which provides no corrosion resistance).  Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen).  Chromium carbide precipitation at the [[grain boundaries]] can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.  
* [[Lead]]: Soldering is performed using [[Solder#Lead-free solder|lead-free solder]].
* [[Indium]]: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems.
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]]: High vapor pressures during system bake-out.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV.  Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, [[organic solvents]], or [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  [[Electropolishing]] is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface.  This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* [[Screws]]: Threads have a high surface area and tend to "trap" gases, and therefore, are avoided.  Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a "virtual leak".  This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vented Screws - AccuGroup|url=https://www.accu.co.uk/en/971-vented-screws|publisher=accu.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Welding]]: Processes such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[shielded metal arc welding]] cannot be used, due to the deposition of [[slag|impure material]] and potential introduction of voids or porosity. [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as [[electron beam welding]] or [[laser beam welding]], are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential [[slag]] inclusions (such as [[submerged arc welding]] and [[flux-cored arc welding]]) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS)
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES)
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS)
* [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy]] (TPD)
* [[Thin film]] growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), UHV [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) and UHV [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD)
* [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES)
* [[Field emission microscopy]] and [[Field ion microscopy]]
* [[Atom Probe|Atom Probe Tomography]] (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period.  At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* [[Particle accelerator]]s The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) 
* [[Gravitational wave detector]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]]. The [[LIGO]] experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravity waves to be sensed. 
* [[Atomic physics]] experiments which use cold atoms, such as [[ion trap]]ping or making [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s
and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Electron beam evaporation|E-beam evaporation]], [[sputtering]] and other deposition techniques.   
* [[Atomic force microscopy]]. High vacuum enables high [[Q factor]]s on the cantilever oscillation.
* [[Scanning tunneling microscopy]]. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and [[semiconductor]] surfaces, e.g. imaging the [[surface reconstruction]] of the unoxidized [[silicon]] surface.
* [[Electron-beam lithography]]

== Achievement ==
Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed &amp;mdash; possibly multiple [[vacuum pump]]s in series and/or parallel
*Minimize surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps &amp;mdash; short and fat, without obstruction
*Use low-[[outgassing]] materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*[[Electropolishing|Electropolish]] all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Bake the system to remove water or hydrocarbons [[adsorbed]] to the walls
*Chill chamber walls to [[cryogenic]] temperatures during use
*Avoid all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint &amp;mdash; always use gloves

[[Outgassing]] is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, [[stainless steel]], and [[ceramic]]s) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce outgassing further.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the [[grain boundaries]] in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

There is no single [[vacuum pump]] that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:
*[[Turbomolecular pump]]s (especially compound and/or [[magnetic bearing]] types)
*[[Ion pump]]s
*[[Titanium sublimation pump]]s
*[[Non-Evaporable Getter|Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps]]
*[[Cryopump]]s

UHV pressures are measured with an [[ion gauge]], either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).

== UHV manipulator ==
A '''UHV manipulator''' allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned.  It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both.  The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes.  To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side.  Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, [[stepping motor]]s, [[piezoelectric motor]]s, and [[pneumatics]].

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field.  Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat.  For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.
