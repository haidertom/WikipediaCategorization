[[File:Bertillon, Alphonse, fiche anthropométrique recto-verso.jpg|thumb|Anthropometric data sheet (both sides) of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], a pioneer in anthropological criminology]]
'''Anthropological criminology''' (sometimes referred to as '''criminal anthropology''', literally a combination of the study of the [[human]] species and the study of [[crime|criminals]]) is a field of [[offender profiling]], based on perceived links between the nature of a [[crime]] and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. Although similar to [[physiognomy]] and [[phrenology]], the term "criminal [[anthropology]]" is generally reserved for the works of the [[Italian school of criminology]] of the late 19th century ([[Cesare Lombroso]], [[Enrico Ferri]], [[Raffaele Garofalo]]). Lombroso thought that criminals were born with inferior physiological differences which were detectable. He popularized the notion of "born criminal" and thought that criminality was an [[atavism]] or [[hereditary]] disposition. His central idea was to locate crime completely within the individual and utterly divorce it from the surrounding social conditions and structures. A founder of the [[Positivist school]] of criminology, Lombroso opposed the social positivism developed by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and [[environmental criminology]].

On the other hand, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853&amp;ndash;1914) created a [[mugshot]] identification system for criminals prior to the invention of [[fingerprinting]]. [[Hans Gross]] (1847&amp;ndash;1915), leading worker in the field of [[criminology]] was also involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;''Anthropological Criminology, North Carolina Wesleyan College, retrieved from [http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm here] on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009044430/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm |date=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Darwinism ==
The theory of anthropological criminology was influenced heavily by the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882). However, the influences came mainly from philosophy derived from Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], specifically that some species were morally superior to others. This idea was in fact spawned by [[Social Darwinism]], but nevertheless formed a critical part of anthropological criminology.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The work of Cesare Lombroso was continued by Social Darwinists in the [[United States]] between 1881 and 1911.

==The theory==

In the 19th century, Cesare Lombroso and his followers, performed autopsies on criminals and declared that they had discovered similarities between the [[physiologies]] of the bodies and those of "primitive humans", monkeys and apes. Most of these similarities involved receding foreheads, height, head shape and size, and based on these Lombroso postulated the theory of the ‘born criminal’. Lombroso also declared that the female offender was worse than the male, as they had strong masculine characteristics.

Lombroso outlined 14 physiognomic characteristics which he and his followers believed to be common in all criminals: unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances (bumps) on head, in back of head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos on body; receding hairline; bumps on head, particularly above left ear; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets, but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders, but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Lombroso published several works regarding his work, ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''L'Homme Criminel (The Criminal Man)'', ''The Female Offender'' (original titled ''Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman'') and ''Criminal Man, According to the Classification of Cesare Lombroso''.

==Rejection==

During Lombroso's life, British scientist [[Charles Buckman Goring]] (1870&amp;ndash;1919) was also working in the same area, and concluded that there were no noticeable physiological differences between law-abiding people and those who committed crimes. Maurice Parmelee, seen as the founder of modern criminology in America, also began to reject the theory of anthropological criminology in 1911, which led to its eventual withdrawal from the field of accepted criminology research.

==Modern times==

Despite general rejection of Lombroso's theories, anthropological criminology still finds a place of sort in modern criminal profiling. Historically (particularly in the 1930s) criminal anthropology had been associated somewhat with [[eugenics]] as the idea of a physiological flaw in the human race was often associated with plans to remove such flaws. This was found particularly in America, with the American Eugenics Movement between 1907 and 1939, and the [[Anti-miscegenation laws]], and also in Germany during the [[Third Reich]] where 250,000 mentally disabled Germans were killed.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Criminal anthropology, and the closely related study of Physiognomy, have also found their way into studies of [[social psychology]] and [[forensic psychology]]. Studies into the nature of [[twins]] also combines aspects of criminal anthropology, as some studies reveal that identical twins share a likelihood of criminal activities more so than non-identical twins. Lombroso's theories are also found in studies of [[Galvanic skin response]] and [[XYY syndrome|XYY chromosome syndrome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Autassassinophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which a person is [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by the risk of being killed. The [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] may overlap with some other fetishes that risk one's life, such as those involving drowning or choking. This does not necessarily mean the person must actually be in a life-threatening situation, for many are aroused from dreams and fantasies of such.
[[File:Joe Weiss 1957 Gang Girl.jpg|thumb]]

The term was introduced by [[John Money]] who also defined [[erotophonophilia]] as the "reciprocal condition" in which one is aroused by "stage-managing and carrying out the murder of an unsuspecting sexual partner". Money classified both these paraphilias as "of the sacrificial/expiatory type". These concepts, especially their imperfect reciprocity, were criticized by [[Lisa Downing]] who wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The autassassinophiliac, for Money, is more interested in his orgasm than in his death, resulting in a compulsion to 'stage manage the ''possibility'' rather than the ''actuality'' of his end at the hands of another person. The erotophonophiliac, on the other hand, is driven by the actualization of the other's death and &amp;ndash; crucially &amp;ndash; this other must be unaware of the would-be killer's intentions. These definitions, then, effectively preclude reciprocity and are constructed here in such a way as to prevent the possibility of consent. The sexologist, it seems, is incapable of imagining mutuality in this context. [...] The imagined pact is used here as an incentive to the would-be libertarian to support the suppression of paraphilia and the conversion of a death-related desire to a life-giving form."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Downing, "Eros and Thanatos in European and American Sexology" in Kate Fisher, Sarah Toulalan (eds.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''BMW Guggenheim Lab''' is a collaboration between the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[BMW]] Group.  It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] mobile laboratory that visited three cities around the world between 2011 and 2013.  The lab is part urban [[think tank]], part [[community center]], and part gathering space, and explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse.&lt;ref name="bmw"&gt;McHugh, Sharon. [http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16691 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in NYC"], ''World Architecture News'', May 17, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which would travel to three cities.  The lab has an advisory committee of experts and is operated by a lab team.

The Lab was expected to travel to nine cities over the course of six years.  In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project, and the project ended in 2014, with an exhibition in New York.&lt;ref name=BMWend&gt;Vogel, Carol. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/bmw-ends-support-for-guggenheim-lab-project/ "BMW Ends Support for Guggenheim Lab Project"], ''The New York Times'', July 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept, organization and structures==
The concept behind the lab was developed by David van der Leer, assistant curator, architecture and urban studies, and Maria Nicanor, assistant curator, architecture, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. The lab's advisory committee is composed of internationally renowned experts in a range of fields and nominates members for each city's lab team, an interdisciplinary group that will help create the programming for that location.&lt;ref name=vogel1&gt;Carol Vogel, "A Lab on a Mission", ''The New York Times'', May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;"Six-Year Collaboration to Examine Contemporary Urban Issues in Nine Cities Around the World – International Advisory Committee Selects New York BMW Guggenheim Lab Team – Design of First Mobile Laboratory", Associated Press, May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which could be moved and would travel to three cities. Only one structure was built.  It was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm [[Atelier Bow-Wow]]. [[Seoul]]-based graphic designers Sulki &amp; Min created the graphic identity for the project, including an interactive logo that changed over the course of the project.&lt;ref name=mobile&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/4121-bglmay6 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in New York City on August 3 Before Traveling to Berlin and Asia"], Guggenheim Foundation, May 6, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vogel2&gt;Vogel, Carol.

The lab's three-city cycle was designed around the theme ''Confronting Comfort'', which explores ways of making urban environments more responsive to people's needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility.  The program was designed to proactively engage residents from each city, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and it addressed ideas and issues of particular relevance to each city.&lt;ref name=GuggLabSite&gt;[http://www.bmwguggenheimlab.org "What Is the Lab?"], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee members are: [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[Nicholas Humphrey]], [[Muchadeyi Masunda]], [[Enrique Peñalosa]], [[Juliet Schor]], [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]], and [[Wang Shi (entrepreneur)|Wang Shi]].&lt;ref name=vogel1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

==New York City==
The lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries.&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;  Members of the New York Lab Team were Omar Freilla, founder and coordinator of [[Green Worker Cooperatives]], [[Bronx]], New York; [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], Canadian journalist and urban experimentalist; Olatunbosun Obayomi, Nigerian [[microbiologist]] and inventor; and architects and [[urbanists]] Elma van Boxel and Kristian Koreman, founders of [[Zones Urbaines Sensible (consulting)|Zones Urbaines Sensible]], [[Rotterdam]]. The first Public Programs Manager in New York City was Rosanna Flouty.&lt;ref&gt;Boscawen, Rosanna.

==Berlin==
From June 15 to July 29, 2012, the lab was open in Pfefferberg, a complex of galleries and artist studios in [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/04/following-threats-bmw-guggenheim-lab-finds-new-berlin-location/1665/ "Following Threats, BMW Guggenheim Lab Finds a New Berlin Location"], ''The Atlantic Cities'', April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Berlin Lab were José Gómez-Márquez, program director for the [[Innovations in International Health]] Initiative (IIH) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT); Italian architect and engineer [[Carlo Ratti]], who directs the [[MIT Senseable City Lab]]; Berlin-based artist Corinne Rose, who works with photography and video and teaches at the Bern University of the Arts, Switzerland; and Rachel Smith, principal transport planner with [[AECOM]], based in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;&lt;ref name=berlin&gt;[https://www.dexigner.com/news/24158 "BMW Guggenheim Lab Berlin to Open in May 2012"], Dexigner, November 9, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (Gómez-Márquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Mumbai==
The lab opened in [[Mumbai]], India on December 9, 2012 and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the [[Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum]] in Mumbai’s [[Byculla]] neighborhood, with additional satellite locations around the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/objectlessons/2012/10/22/the-bmw-guggenheim-lab-gets-a-mumbai-makeover/ The BMW Guggenheim Lab Gets a Mumbai Makeover], Artinfo.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The lab's team consisted of Aisha Dasgupta, a British demographer based in Malawi; Neville Mars, a Dutch architect based in China; Trupti Amritwar Vaitla, an architect and urban transport designer from Mumbai; and Héctor Zamora, a Mexican artist based in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/58322/bmw-guggenheim-lab-to-launch-in-mumbai/  "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in Mumbai"], Architizer.com, accessed October 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects, including a competition to redesign Mumbai's Kala Nagar Junction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitednetworker.com/us/2012/10/22/bmw-guggenheim-lab-mumbai-to-open-december-9-2012-at-dr-bhau-daji-lad-museum-with-pop-up-sites-throughout-the-city/ BMW Guggenheim Lab Mumbai to Open December 9, 2012], UnitedNetworker.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/six-designs-selected-as-solutions-for-congested-kala-nagar-junction/articleshow/18079917.cms Six designs selected as solutions for congested Kala Nagar junction], ''Times of India'', January 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final exhibition==
The program concluded with an exhibition, ''Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab'', which was on view at the New York museum from October 2013 through January 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=BMWend/&gt; The exhibition featured photos and videos from the Lab's public programs and displayed 100 terms representing the "most-talked about words" during the Lab's activities in New York, Berlin, and Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/10/131017-BMW-Guggenheim-Lab-Comes-to-a-Close-with-Exhibition.asp BMW Guggenheim Lab Comes to an Early End], Architectural Record, October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework for the Big Bang model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using [[Type Ia supernova]]e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]], the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "[[age of the universe]]" — is 13.799 ± 0.021&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Planck Collaboration |title=Planck 2015 results.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name=gl1927&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to [[Hubble's law]] (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the relative abundances of light elements produced by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles. Peaking at around {{val|372|14|u=kyr}},&lt;ref name="WMAP2003Spergel" /&gt; the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than &lt;chem&gt;^3He&lt;/chem&gt;, and in constant ratios, too.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|182–185}}

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored [[cold dark matter]] model which include the [[dwarf galaxy problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullock |first1=James |title=Notes on the Missing Satellites Problem |journal=XX Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics on Local Group Cosmology |arxiv=1009.4505|bibcode = 2010arXiv1009.4505B |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cuspy halo problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diemand |first1=Jürg |last2=Zemp |first2=Marcel |last3=Moore |first3=Ben |last4=Stadel |first4=Joachim |last5=Carollo |first5=C.

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D. N. |display-authors=etal |title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology |pages=377–408 |format=PDF |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=170 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Penrose|title=The Road to Reality|publisher=Vintage books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-679-77631-4|title-link=The Road to Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2015}}

A '''binary system''' is a system of two [[astronomical bodies]] which are close enough that their [[gravitational]] attraction causes them to [[orbit]] each other around a [[barycenter]] ''(also see [[Barycenter#Gallery|animated examples]])''. More restrictive definitions require that this common center of mass is not located within the interior of either object, in order to exclude the typical planet–[[Natural satellite|satellite]] systems and planetary systems.

The most common binary systems are [[binary star]]s and [[binary asteroid]], but [[brown dwarf]]s, [[planet]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[black hole]]s and [[galaxies]] can also form binaries.

A ''multiple system'' is like a binary system but consists of three or more objects such as for [[trinary star]]s and [[trinary asteroid]]s.

== Classification ==

In a binary system the brighter object is referred to as '''primary''', and the other the '''secondary'''. 

They are also classified based on orbit. '''Wide binaries''' are objects with orbits that keep them apart from one another. They evolve separately and have very little effect on each other. '''Close binaries''' are close to each other and are able to transfer mass from one another.

They can also be classified based on how we observe them. '''Visual binaries''' are two stars separated enough that they can be viewed through a telescope or binoculars.

'''Eclipsing binaries''' are where the objects' orbits are at an angle that when one passes in front of the other it causes an [[eclipse]], as seen from Earth.
 
'''Astrometric binaries''' are objects that seem to move around nothing as their companion object cannot be identified, it can only be inferred. The companion object may not be bright enough or may be hidden in the glare from the primary object.

A related classification though not a binary system is '''Optical binary''' which refers to objects that are so close together in the sky that they appear to be a binary system but are not. Such objects merely appear to be close together, but lie at different distances from the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.space.com/22509-binary-stars.html |title=Binary Star Systems: Classification and Evolution |publisher=[[Space.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= [[Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg]] |title=Analysis of Spectroscopic Binaries |author=Holger Lehmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Binary companion (minor planets) ==
[[File:Pluto-Charon System.gif|thumb|right|Pluto and its moon Charon are often described as a binary system.]]
{{main|Binary asteroid}}

When binary minor planets are similar in size, they may be called "[[Binary asteroid|binary companions]]" instead of referring to the smaller body as a satellite.&lt;ref name="IAU-list"&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-09-17 |title=Satellites and Companions of Minor Planets |publisher=IAU / [[Minor Planet Center]] |url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/minorsats.html |accessdate=2011-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121153650/http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/minorsats.html |archivedate=2011-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good examples of true binary companions are the [[90 Antiope]] and the [[79360 Sila–Nunam]] systems. [[Pluto]] and its largest moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] are sometimes described as a binary system because the [[barycenter]] (center of mass) of the two objects is not inside either of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/can-we-call-pluto-and-charon-a-binary-planet-yet-140808.htm |title=Can We Call Pluto and Charon a 'Binary Planet' Yet? |author=Ian O'Neill |website=Discovery News |date=8 August 2014 |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{main|Binary stars in fiction}}
*In the Discovery program ''[[Alien Planet]]'', the planet [[Darwin IV]] orbits a binary system.
*In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]] orbits a binary system
*In the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' episode "Planet Jackers", one of the aforementioned Jackers mentions a binary system.
*Binary sun systems are featured in the ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' game, these systems are in the [[Milky Way]] as explorable areas.
*A binary sun system is featured in the short story by Dan Simmons, "Orphans of the Helix."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">A '''canonical cover''' &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; for F (a set of [[Functional dependency|functional dependencies]] on a [[Relation (database)|relation scheme]]) is a set of dependencies such that F logically implies all dependencies in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; logically implies all dependencies in F.

The set &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; has two important properties:
# No functional dependency in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; contains an extraneous attribute.
# Each left side of a functional dependency in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; is unique. That is, there are no two dependencies &lt;math&gt;a \to b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \to d&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;.

A canonical cover is not unique for a given set of functional dependencies, therefore one set F can have multiple covers &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algorithm for computing a canonical cover &lt;ref&gt;''Database system concepts'' by Abraham Silberschatz et al&lt;/ref&gt;==

# &lt;math&gt;F_c = F&lt;/math&gt;
# Repeat:
## Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;a \to b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \to d&lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;a \to bd&lt;/math&gt;  ..
## Find a functional dependency in &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; with an extraneous attribute and delete it from &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt;
# ... until &lt;math&gt;F_c&lt;/math&gt; does not change

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8348">The '''Center for Media and Public Affairs''' ('''CMPA''') is a self-described  [[nonpartisan]] and [[nonprofit]] [[research]] and educational organization that is affiliated with [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].  It was founded in 1985 by political scientists [[S. Robert Lichter]] and his ex-wife Linda Lichter. It published a newsletter called ''Media Monitor'' from 1987 to 2010.

==Research==
The CMPA conducts studies of the [[news]] and entertainment [[Mass media|media]]. Among its activities are a continuing [[analysis]] and [[tabulation]] of late night [[political jokes]],&lt;ref&gt;Political Humor in TV Talk Shows. In Schaefer, Todd and Thomas Birkland, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Media and Politics in America'' Washington DC: CQ Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, D., Lichter, S.R., and Amundson, D: The Political Content of Late Night Comedy. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Summer 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; an annual report on diversity among network news journalists,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Johnson, “Rising News Diversity Makes News,” USA Today, Feb. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[content analysis]] of the nightly news on the major broadcast and cable news networks.

The results of the latter are compiled in the CMPA newsletter.  CMPA engages in [[health communication]] research, investigating the way in which [[science|scientific issues]] are conveyed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Assessing Local Television News Coverage of Health Issues. Menlo Park, CA: Kaiser Family Foundation, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  CMPA also engages in [[survey research]] to determine the accuracy of media's reports of scientific opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Food for Thought: Reporting of Diet, Nutrition and Food Safety.  Washington, DC: International Food Information Council, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMPA conducts [[social science|social scientific]] research on [[mass media|media coverage]] with the use of such techniques as [[content analysis]] and [[survey research]]. Its studies appear in [[academic journals]] and reference works as well as in popular media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Media and Public Affairs. In Schaefer, Todd and Thomas Birkland, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Media and Politics in America.'' Washington DC: CQ Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: Ideological Bias. In Wolfgang Donsbach, ed., ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' London: Blackwell/ICA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: "The Presidency and the Press -- Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush." In Stephen Vaughan, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of American Journalism''. New York: Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dye, T., Ziegler, H., and Lichter, S.R: American ''Politics in the Media Age''. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1992. Fourth edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Stanley and Richard Niemi ''Vital Statistics on American Politics''. Washington D.C.: CQ Press, 2008, pp.183-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMPA's signature activity is its "rapid response" studies of media coverage of current issues, which appear quickly enough to influence ongoing [[debate|public debates]], such as [[election|presidential campaigns]], [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation hearings, and major policy debates in [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: A Plague on Both Parties: Substance and Fairness in TV Election News. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics''. Vol. 6, No. 3 (Summer 2001) 8-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, S. and Lichter, S.R: The Mediated Congress. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'', Vol 10, no 2 (Spring 2005) 94-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, S. and Lichter, S.R: New Presidents and Network News. ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', Vol 34, no 3 (September 2004) 674-690.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although CMPA avoids taking stands on political issues, its studies have sometimes become part of the public debate over the media's role in [[politics]] and [[society]]. For example, in 1992 a CMPA study found that the average length of a presidential candidate's [[soundbite]] on the evening news had dropped to less than ten seconds, down from 42 seconds in 1968. In response CBS adopted a policy requiring longer soundbites on the [[CBS Evening News]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Kurtz, “Media Notes,” ''Washington Post'', July 7, 1992; Rick Schindler, “CBS Vows to Serve Up Chewier Sound Bites,” ''TV Guide'', July 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] note that the CMPA, along with several other nonpartisan non-profit organizations, help to police the media through the creation of  "flak," which they define as "negative responses to a media statement or program" and which they maintain is part of a project of "[[dominant ideology|disciplining]] the media." &lt;ref&gt;Edward S.

CMPA studies of entertainment media have been used by members of the [[United States Congress]] such as Sen. [[Joe Lieberman]] (I-CT) in their efforts to reduce gratuitous violence and sex in television entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;David Hatch, “Every Four Minutes,” ''Electronic Media'', Sept. 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; CMPA's research on entertainment media has also included studies of how various groups have been portrayed on television, such as studies of Hispanic Americans' portrayals commissioned by the National Council of [[La Raza]] and the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Don't Blink: Hispanics in Television Entertainment.'' Washington, DC: National Council of La Raza, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Monitor==
Media Monitor was the bi-monthly publication of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which presented the central findings of one or more research studies on [[media monitoring]]. It was started in 1987 and last published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Monitor|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/media-monitor/oclc/556100519|work=WorldCat|accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a concise analysis of contemporary [[media coverage]] and the controversies that surround it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major Findings|url=http://www.cmpa.com/files/1995-1.pdf|accessdate=August 10, 2015|work=Media Monitor|issue=IX|date=December 1995}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research published was the result of quantitative [[content analysis]] of television, print, and radio [[news]].

==Funding==

The media watchdog group [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) has challenged CMPA's non-partisan claim, based on the argument that much of its funding has come from conservative sources, and that its founder, Dr. [[S. Robert Lichter]], once held a chair in [[mass communications]] at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and was a [[Fox News]] contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2515|title=Study of Bias or Biased Study?|last=Press Release|date=May 14, 1992|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=Peter|author2=Steve Rendall|date=July–August 1998|title=Meet the Myth-Makers: Right-Wing Media Groups Provide Ammo for "Liberal Media" Claims|journal=Extra!|url=http://www.fair.org/extra/9807/myth-makers.html|access-date=2008-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200412/http://www.fair.org/extra/9807/myth-makers.html#|archive-date=2008-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a ''Washington Post'' article referred to CMPA as "[[conservative]]," the ''Post'' published a "Clarification," which concluded, "The Center describes itself as nonpartisan, and its studies have been cited by both conservative and liberal commentators."&lt;ref&gt;"Clarification," ''Washington Post'', February 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18871">'''Clathrin''' is a [[protein]] that plays a major role in the formation of coated [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Clathrin was first isolated and named by [[Barbara Pearse]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="pmid1063406"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearse BM | title = Clathrin: a unique protein associated with intracellular transfer of membrane by coated vesicles | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 1255–9 |year=1976 | pmid = 1063406 | pmc = 430241 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.73.4.1255 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a [[triskelion]] shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains. When the triskelia interact they form a [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] lattice that surrounds the vesicle. This is how clathrin gets its name, from the [[Latin]] ''clathratus'' meaning like a lattice. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116085409/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clathrin triskelion is composed of three clathrin heavy chains interacting at their [[C-terminus |C-termini]], each ~190 kDa heavy chain has a ~25 kDa light chain tightly bound to it. The three heavy chains provide the structural backbone of the clathrin lattice, and the three light chains are thought to regulate the formation and disassembly of a clathrin lattice. There are two forms of clathrin light chains, designated a and b. The main clathrin heavy chain, located on [[Chromosome 17 (human) |chromosome 17]] in humans, is found in all cells. A second clathrin heavy chain gene, on [[chromosome 22 (human) |chromosome 22]], is expressed in muscle.

Clathrin heavy chain is often described as a leg, with subdomains, representing the foot (the [[N-terminal]] domain), followed by the ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg, and trimerization domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The other domains form a super-helix of short alpha helices. This was originally determined from the structure of the proximal leg domain that identified and is composed of a smaller structural module referred to as clathrin heavy chain repeat motifs. The light chains bind primarily to the proximal leg portion of the heavy chain with some interaction near the trimerization domain. The β-propeller at the 'foot' of clathrin contains multiple binding sites for interaction with other proteins.

When triskelia assemble together in solution, they can interact with enough flexibility to form 6-sided rings ([[hexagons]]) that yield a flat lattice, or 5-sided rings ([[pentagons]]) that are necessary for curved lattice formation. When many triskelions connect, they can form a basket-like structure. The structure shown, is built of 36 triskelia, one of which is shown in blue. Another common assembly is a [[truncated icosahedron]]. To enclose a vesicle, exactly 12 pentagons must be present in the lattice.

In a cell, clathrin triskelion in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein that has bound membrane, linking one of its three feet to the membrane at a time. Clathrin cannot bind to membrane or cargo directly and instead uses adaptor proteins to do this. This triskelion will bind to other membrane-attached triskelia to form a rounded lattice of hexagons and pentagons, reminiscent of the panels on a soccer ball, that pulls the membrane into a bud. By constructing different combinations of 5-sided and 6-sided rings, vesicles of different sizes may assemble. The smallest clathrin cage commonly imaged, called a mini-coat, has 12 pentagons and only two hexagons. Even smaller cages with zero hexagons probably do not form from the native protein, because the feet of the triskelia are too bulky.

== Function ==

Clathrin performs critical roles in shaping rounded vesicles in the [[cytoplasm]] for intracellular trafficking. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) selectively sort cargo at the [[cell membrane]], trans-[[golgi apparatus|Golgi network]], and [[endosome|endosomal]] compartments for multiple membrane traffic pathways. After a vesicle buds into the cytoplasm, the coat rapidly disassembles, allowing the clathrin to recycle while the vesicle gets transported to a variety of locations.

Adaptor molecules are responsible for self-assembly and recruitment. Two examples of [[Adaptor proteins, vesicular transport|adaptor protein]]s are [[AP180]]&lt;ref name="urlClathrin and its interactions with AP180"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html| title =Clathrin and its interactions with AP180.| author =McMahon HT| date =| work =| publisher =MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090501052207/http://endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html| archivedate =2009-05-01| quote =micrographs of clathrin assembly| accessdate =2009-04-17| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[epsin]].&lt;ref name="urlEpsin 1 EM gallery"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/MonolayerEMs.html| title =Epsin 1 EM gallery| author =McMahon HT| date =| work =| publisher =MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology,| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090102032308/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/MonolayerEMs.html| archivedate =2009-01-02| quote =micrographs of vesicle budding| accessdate =2009-04-17| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11161218"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford MG, Pearse BM, Higgins MK, Vallis Y, Owen DJ, Gibson A, Hopkins CR, Evans PR, McMahon HT | authorlink2 = Barbara Pearse | title = Simultaneous binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and clathrin by AP180 in the nucleation of clathrin lattices on membranes | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5506 | pages = 1051–5 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11161218 | doi = 10.1126/science.291.5506.1051 | url = http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/ford.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121191304/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/ford.pdf | archivedate = 2008-11-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12076538"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Higgins MK, McMahon HT | title = Snap-shots of clathrin-mediated endocytosis | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12076538 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(02)02089-3 | url = http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/mcmahon.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121220307/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/mcmahon.pdf | archivedate = 2008-11-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; AP180 is used in synaptic vesicle formation. It recruits clathrin to membranes and also promotes its [[polymerization]]. Epsin also recruits clathrin to membranes and promotes its polymerization, and can help deform the membrane, and thus clathrin-coated vesicles can bud. In a cell, a triskelion floating in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein, linking one of its feet to the membrane at a time. The skelion will bind to other ones attached to the membrane to form a polyhedral lattice, skelion, which pulls the membrane into a bud. The skelion does not bind directly to the membrane, but binds to the adaptor proteins that recognize the molecules on the membrane surface.

Clathrin has another function aside from the coating of [[organelle]]s. In non-dividing cells, the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously. Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is shut down in cells undergoing [[mitosis]]. During mitosis, clathrin binds to the [[spindle apparatus]], in complex with two other proteins: [[TACC3]] and ch-TOG/[[CKAP5]]. Clathrin aids in the congression of chromosomes by stabilizing [[kinetochore]] fibers of the [[mitotic spindle]]. The amino-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the TACC domain of TACC3 make the microtubule binding surface for TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin to bind to the [[mitotic spindle]]. The stabilization of [[kinetochore]] fibers requires the trimeric structure of clathrin in order to crosslink microtubules.&lt;ref name="Clathrin is required for the function of the mitotic spindle"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Royle SJ, Bright NA, Lagnado L | title = Clathrin is required for the function of the mitotic spindle | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | pages = 1152–1157 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03502 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/full/nature03502.html | pmid = 15858577 | issue = 7037 | pmc = 3492753 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712175953/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/full/nature03502.html | archivedate = 2007-07-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coordination of adjacent domains mediates TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin assembly and mitotic spindle binding"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hood FE, Williams SJ, Burgess SG, Richards MW, Roth D, Straube A, Pfuhl M, Bayliss R, Royle SJ | title = Coordination of adjacent domains mediates TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin assembly and mitotic spindle binding | journal = [[Journal of Cell Biology]] | volume = 202 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–78 |year=2013 | pmid = 23918938 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201211127 | url = | pmc=3734082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Receptor-mediated endocytosis |Clathrin-mediated endocytosis]] (CME) regulates many cellular physiological processes such as the internalization of growth factors and receptors, entry of pathogens, and synaptic transmission. It is believed that cellular invaders use the nutrient pathway to gain access to a cell's replicating mechanisms. Certain signalling molecules open the nutrients pathway. Two chemical compounds called Pitstop 1 and Pitstop 2, selective clathrin inhibitors, can interfere with the pathogenic activity, and thus protect the cells against invasion. These two compounds selectively block the endocytic ligand association with the clathrin terminal domain in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;Role of the Clathrin Terminal Domain in Regulating Coated Pit Dynamics Revealed by Small Molecule Inhibition|Cell, Volume 146, Issue 3, 471-484, 5 August 2011 [http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2811%2900667-2 Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119233601/http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00667-2 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the specificity of these compounds to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been questioned.&lt;ref name="Pitstop 2 is a potent inhibitor of clathrin-independent endocytosis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutta D, Williamson CD, Cole NB, Donaldson JG | title = Pitstop 2 is a potent inhibitor of clathrin-independent endocytosis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | pages = e45799 | date = Sep 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045799 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045799 | pmid = 23029248 | issue = 9 | pmc = 3448704 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811163931/http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045799 | archivedate = 2014-08-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clearance cairn''' is an irregular and unstructured collection of [[fieldstone]]s which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective [[agriculture]] and collected into a usually low mound or [[cairn]]. Commonly of [[Bronze Age]] origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durham-pa.gov.uk/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PGlossary?readform&amp;GLOSSARY=clearance+cairns Keys to the Past Glossary.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 English Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124019/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 |date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Clearance cairns in Palestine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of clearance ==
[[File:AncientPlough.jpg|thumb|left|Single-handled [[ard_(plough)|ard]]]]
[[File:Mouldboard plough.JPG|thumb|A reconstructed mould board plough.]]
By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetrail.warwickshire.gov.uk/searchglossary.aspx?term=clearance%20cairn Warwickshire Time Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/cairns_moor.htm The Cairns of Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised [[ploughing]] resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.
[[File:Bellfield walled garden.JPG|thumb|A typical [[walled garden]] where the stone acts as a slow release radiator]]
Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc.  The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming.  Many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.

=== Heat radiation ===
The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"&gt;[http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm Archaeology of Pembrokeshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508151602/http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walled gardens produce the same effect.

== Creation ==
[[File:Eglinton mound feature.JPG|thumb|A mound associated with a bog-wood and a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]].]]
[[File:Bog-wood Eglinton.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bog-wood]] associated with a clearance cairn.]]
Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.

The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc.
Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the [[Gardberg site]] in [[Vestre Slidre]], [[Oppland]], [[Norway]]. A [[Bronze Age]] origin for clearance cairns is more common.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Plough marks 2.JPG|thumb|Ard or plough-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn]]
[[File:Plough marks.JPG|left|thumb|Ard-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]]]]
[[File:Mechanised clearance cairn.JPG|thumb|A clearance cairn formed using mechanised extraction]]
[[File:Recent Clearance Cairn.JPG|left|thumb|A recent clearance cairn devoid of lichen and moss growth]]
Cairns may be discrete, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations—linear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or [[Ard (plough)|ard-marks]] at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan/cladh-hallan02.html Ard-marks at Cladh Hallan]&lt;/ref&gt; These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal.

Other items such as  [[bog-wood]] and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the [[tannin]]s from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.

Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.&lt;ref name="Cairns1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Construction of cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of [[round barrow]]s, stone [[hut circle]]s, [[ring cairn]]s, or [[burnt mound]]s. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields.

Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Clitter cairns.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moraines can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Monument Class descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268024/html/c589.html Burial Cairns in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed.

== Natural history ==
Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723055822/http://www.brrhoen.de/en/23-plants Plants on cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape history ==
In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.&lt;ref name="Wickham-Jones"&gt;Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), ''The Landscape of Scotland''. Stroud : The History Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-1484-3}}. pp. 48 – 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stone carrying ==
[[Lifting stone|Stone carry]] or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can. The sport may have grown out of the act of clearing stones from fields to create pastures and arable land.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The '''Columbia Memorial Space Center''' (CMSC) is a [[science museum]] owned and operated by the [[Downey, California|City of Downey, California]]. Located on 12400 Columbia Way in Downey, it is open to the general public as hands-on space museum and activity center in the [[Los Angeles area]].&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

==Mission==
The center's mission is to "ignite people's passion in science, technology, engineering, and space while honoring Downey's aerospace history."&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

==History==
The site of the museum is the former [[Boeing]]/[[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]/[[North American]] plant where all of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]s were built and the [[Space Shuttle]] was conceived. In 1999, when the Downey Plant closed, the City of Downey began a redevelopment effort, including an educational component. In early 2007, a builder — Tower General Contractors — was selected, and ground was broken on April 12, 2007, on the 18,000 square foot project.&lt;ref name="coll070201"/&gt;

[[File:STS-107 Flight Insignia.svg|right|thumb|STS-107 mission insignia]]
First opened in 2008, CMSC is recognized as the National Memorial to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] and its crew that was lost on [[STS-107]].&lt;ref name="latm081128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pl108391"/&gt;

On November 7, 2008, a propane tank exploded during the filming of an episode of the television series, ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''. An electrical fire occurred, but resulted in no damage to the museum.&lt;ref name="nytm081107"/&gt;

==Exhibits==
Designated a [[Challenger Learning Center]],&lt;ref name="challcen"/&gt; the museum has a variety of camps, workshops, and other monthly events to generate interest in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] in addition to hands on exhibits. Now 20,000 square feet, the two-story building features a [[robotics]] lab, [[High-definition video|HD]] computer lab, and a wide range of interactive exhibits that provide engaging insights into [[Space Shuttle]] operations, living and working on the [[International Space Station]], exploration of our [[solar system]], [[aerospace engineering]], and the range of fields of study and jobs related to [[human]] and robotic [[space exploration]].&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

In 2012, the first "Space Shuttle" – a wood and plastic full-scale mockup built by [[North American Rockwell]] in 1972 – was placed on temporary display at the center.&lt;ref name="asmg120614"/&gt; Dubbed the "[[Space Shuttle Inspiration|Space Shuttle ''Inspiration'']]", it was disassembled and returned to storage in early 2014.&lt;ref name="dpat140306"/&gt;

In front of the center, a dummy "[[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]]" Apollo command capsule, BP-12 is on display. This was the first Apollo capsule to fly&lt;ref name="nasaksc3"/&gt; and now owned by the City of Downey, on display.&lt;ref name="amspace4"/&gt;. The center also owns the Apollo Boilerplate, BP-19A &lt;ref name="coll1200306"/&gt;, however, it is currently in storage (2018).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5620">{{distinguish|radio silence|news blackout}}
In [[telecommunication]]s, communications blackouts are
* a cessation of [[telecommunication|communications]] or communications capability, caused by a [[power outage|lack of power]] to a communications [[Facility (telecommunications)|facility]] or to communications equipment.
* a total lack of radio communications capability, caused by [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] anomalies, e.g., during strong auroral activity or during re-entry of a [[spacecraft]] into the Earth's atmosphere.

==Technical failures==
[[Uptime]] being a key goal of most [[communications network]]s, [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]] and [[backup generator]]s are typically used to ensure high-reliability power.

Wireless networks may be subject to [[radio jamming]];  wired networks can be physically severed.  [[Network planning and design|Network design]] can also play a role in maintaining communications reliability; depending on the constraints in building a [[fiber-optic]] network, a [[self-healing ring]] topology may be used.

==Spacecraft reentry==
The communications blackouts that affect spacecraft [[atmospheric reentry|re-entering the Earth's atmosphere]], which are also known as '''radio blackouts''', '''ionization blackouts''', or '''reentry blackouts''', are caused by an envelope of ionized air around the craft, created by the heat from the compression of the atmosphere by the craft. The ionized air interferes with radio signals. For the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] spacecraft, such communications blackouts lasted for several minutes.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite book|title=It's only rocket science: an introduction in plain English|author=Lucy Rogers|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn= 978-0-387-75378-2|series=Astronomers' universe: Springer eBooks collection|pages=159–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gemini 2]], for example, endured such a blackout for four minutes, beginning at 9 minutes 5 seconds into the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gemini: steps to the moon|series=Springer-Praxis books in astronomy and space sciences|author=David Shayler|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn= 978-1-85233-405-5|pages=183|chapter=Gemini 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Apollo missions, the communications blackout was approximately three minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Excel HSC physics|author=Neville Warren|publisher=Pascal Press|year=2004|isbn= 978-1-74125-077-0|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Apollo 16]], for example, pre-advisory data (PAD) for re-entry listed the expected times for re-entry communications blackout to be from 0 minutes 16 seconds after entry interface to 3 minutes 33 seconds after entry interface (a total of 3 minutes 17 seconds).&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite book|title=How Apollo Flew to the Moon|series=Springer Praxis Books in Space Exploration|author=W. David Woods|publisher=Springer|year=2008 |isbn=9780387716756 |pages=354, 366}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Apollo 13]] mission, the blackout was much longer than normal because the flight path of the spacecraft was unexpectedly at a much shallower angle than normal.&lt;ref name=Woods /&gt; According to the mission log maintained by [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]], the Apollo 13 re-entry blackout lasted around 6 minutes, beginning at 142:39 and ending at 142:45, and was 1 minute 27 seconds longer than had been predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Ron Howard exaggerate the reentry scene in the movie Apollo 13?|author=Joe Pappalardo|date=2007-05-01|url=http://airspacemag.com/need-to-know/NEED-Apollo13.html|work=[[Air &amp;amp; Space]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications blackouts for re-entry are not solely confined to entry into Earth's atmosphere. They apply to entry into any atmosphere where such ionization occurs around a craft. The [[Mars Pathfinder]] endured a 30-second communications blackout as it entered Mars' atmosphere, for example. The [[Huygens probe]] endured a communications blackout as it entered the atmosphere of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;

Until the creation of the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] (TDRSS), the [[Space Shuttle]] endured a 30-minute blackout. The TDRSS allowed the Shuttle to communicate by relay with a [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite]] during re-entry, through a "hole" in the ionized air envelope at the tail end of the craft, created by the Shuttle's shape.&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;

==Space weather==
Radio blackouts on Earth caused by [[space weather]] are measured by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] on a scale that goes from 1 (minor) to 5 (extreme).&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;

==Solar position==
Communications can also be lost when the [[Sun]] is blocking or behind one station in the same line of sight; [[Sun outage]]s periodically interrupt communications with [[geosynchronous satellite]]s.  It is also a common problem for interplanetary [[space probe|space missions]].

'''''Contexts''''': ''Understanding People in their Social Worlds'' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and an official publication of the [[American Sociological Association]]. It is designed to be a more accessible source of [[sociology|sociological ideas and research]] and has been inspired by the movement towards [[public sociology]].

==History==
The journal was established in 2002 by [[Claude Fischer]] and  is published by [[SAGE Publications]]; until 2011, it was published by the [[University of California Press]]. Fischer was succeeded by [[Jeff Goodwin]] and [[James M. Jasper]], who edited the journal from 2005 to 2007, injecting a certain amount of controversial humor such as [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] cartoons and a column written by "Harry Green" (actually Jasper) called "The Fool." The current editors are Syed Ali and [[Philip N. Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/septoct14/contexts_0914.html "The ''Contexts'' Editors Bring Energy and Experience with Public Engagement," ASA Footnotes article.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The journal differs from a typical academic journal as it is targeted more toward students and the general public. It is used widely in courses,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, and a selection of its premier articles is available in book format through ''The Contexts Reader,'' published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], now in its second edition.

The new editors have introduced a blog feature on the magazines website, Contexts.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

New print issues are published quarterly in February (Winter), May (Spring), August (Summer) and November (Fall).

==Awards==
''Contexts'' won the Best Journal Award in the Social Sciences (2003) by Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the [[Association of American Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/feb03/indexone.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Articles and Interviews==
One of the most notable articles in ''Contexts'' is [[Ann Morning]]'s interview with [[Rachel Doležal]]. The interview has aired on many TV news networks, such as [[Fox News]], [[BBC]], and [[USA Today]], over the possibility of a trans-racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://contexts.org/blog/race-and-rachel-dolezal-an-interview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic journal ranges in topics from [[social mobility]], [[immigration]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] (particularly its role in [[Get Out]]), [[Donald Trump]]'s potential border wall, and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the board members for ''Contexts'', [[Tressie McMillan Cottom]], appeared on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Trevor Noah]] to discuss the impact of [[for-profit higher education in the United States]] on disadvantaged students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''cyberneticist''' or a '''cybernetician''' is a person who practices [[cybernetics]].

[[Heinz von Foerster]] once told [[Stuart Umpleby]] that [[Norbert Wiener]] preferred the term "cybernetician" rather than "cyberneticist",  perhaps because Wiener was a mathematician rather than a physicist.
On the other hand, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] who began as a theoretical physicist, as well as [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] who began his career as a mathematician, regarded  [[Neuro cybernetics]]—and more generally [[Biocybernetics]]—as fields closely allied to [[Mathematical Biology]] and Mathematical Biophysics in which [[control theory]] and [[dynamical system]] theories also play significant roles.

'''Digital Medievalist''' is an [[academic]] project and community-building organization for those who are interested in the use of computers and computational techniques in the academic field of [[medieval studies]], a sub-field of [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Digital Medievalist was established in 2003 as an international collaborative non-profit project based at [[University of Lethbridge]] in [[Canada]], though it has executive board members from a number of other countries.  Although [[University of Lethbridge]] remains the main host and administrative home, the project now has a technical infrastructure which uses donated services from others including the [[University of Kentucky]]. The project grew out of a recognised need for best-practice advice on a disciplinary level in the creation of digital medieval resources.  Although much of the advice and experience of those who would call themselves digital medievalists are applicable to other areas of the [[digital humanities]] and specifically academic research projects in this area, around the time of its creation an increasing need for discipline-based communities of this nature was beginning to be recognised.&lt;ref&gt;See Brogan, M. &amp; Renfrow D. (2005), ''A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature'', Digital Library Federation, p. 17: 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8QYpR1D58UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=kDICmd72r3&amp;sig=w09GF9bj5hcIBZBmniY1Hfgh9YY&amp;hl=en#PPA17,M1]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in response to the overwhelming reception the creation of Digital Medievalist received, the [[Digital Classicist]] project was set up shortly after.

== Governance ==

=== Executive Board ===
Digital Medievalist as an organization is overseen by the volunteer efforts of a fully elected international executive board.  Its bylaws state that its 8-member board are elected by the membership for overlapping two-year terms (thus 4 positions come up for election each year), and that the board chooses a director from amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html for the full bylaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Eligibility for election to the executive board is simply demonstrable participation in digital medieval activities or board-sanctioned equivalancies.  These bylaws also state its commitment to be a non-profit organization, and its general purposes and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#board&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
Membership in Digital Medievalist is free and open to all.  The sole criterion for membership is subscription to its free online discussion list 'dm-l'.  Membership conveys the right to vote in Digital Medievalist elections, and if they have contributed in some meaningful manner, eligibility to run for election to the Digital Medievalist executive board.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#membership&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[Image:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|Opening verses of Mediaeval Cornish manuscript, of the ''Origo Mundi'']] 
Digital Medievalist sees it as its mission to provide a framework to enable members of its community to share information.  These activities include an electronic mailing list, the participation in and organisation of conference sessions or other events, and a website containing an open-access academic journal of record, a wiki/FAQ, and a facility to post news releases.&lt;ref&gt;See printed work: O'Donnell, Daniel P., 'Disciplinary Impact and Technological Obsolescence in Medieval Studies' in ''A Companion to Digital Literary Studies'', ed. by Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mailing list ===
Digital Medievalist runs an electronic mailing list and discussion forum ([http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-l dm-l]) where members of the community ask for advice, share problems, and discuss issues that affect them.  The discussion list currently has around 540 members, many of whom are drawn from widely across the [[Humanities Computing]] field.&lt;ref&gt;See https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/mailing-list/&lt;/ref&gt;  The list traffic is low, with occasional bursts of interest in a particular issue, but is primarily used for announcements of interest to digital medievalists.

=== Journal ===
Digital Medievalist runs a free [[peer-reviewed]] [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] online journal, also called 'Digital Medievalist', which acts as a journal of record for the digital medieval studies field. In many ways this is seen as the most significant output of Digital Medievalist and is where the majority of volunteer effort is directed.  The journal has an entry in the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] listed under the fields of both [[computer science]] and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=findJournals&amp;hybrid=&amp;query=Digital+Medievalist&lt;/ref&gt;  The Digital Medievalist ISSN number is 17150736, and University of Lethbridge is listed as the official publisher. In May 2017, the journal moved from its previous domain at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/ to the [[Open Library of Humanities]] platform, at http://journal.digitalmedievalist.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.digitalmedievalist.org, accessed 26 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal appears to release about one issue every year since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/&lt;/ref&gt;  It has experimented with different formats of releases, for example issue 3 is a rolling-release that previously submitted articles are being added to over time, while issue 4 was a thematic issue of articles arising out of the work of a cognate organization [[Digital Classicist]] in memory of a well-known academic in the field of [[digital humanities]], [[Ross Scaife]].  In addition to experimenting with different models of publication, the project has taken an innovative stance on the problems of academic acceptance of research articles published online.  This the use of so-called 'Ostentatious Peer Review', that is, the accepting editor and the recommending reader who reviewed the article have their name listed as doing so.  The theory is that both the editors and reviewers do a better job (since their name is in evidence for everyone to see) and also by attracting big names in the [[medieval studies]] and/or [[digital humanities|humanities computing]] community, the online publication of the article may be taken more seriously by academic hiring and tenure committees.  While there is informal hearsay evidence that this might be beneficial, and certainly leads to a higher editorial standard than some online journals, there is no hard evidence (yet) that this affects hiring committees.&lt;ref&gt;See http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/tag/peer+review/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences and events ===
Digital Medievalist as an umbrella group for a community interested in digital methodologies in medieval studies has organized conference sessions many years at the most prestigious academic [[Medieval studies]] conferences in existence.  For example, the International Congress on Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Western Michigan University]] and the International Medieval Congress&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ims/imc/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[University of Leeds]] amongst other conferences and events.

ESMT ('''Ecole Supérieure Multinationale des Télécommunications''') is an international institution of higher learning based in Senegal. It offers professional certifications and graduate programs in telecommunication.

== History ==

The organisation was created in 1981 by seven West African states, (Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) on the basis of an initial [[UNDP]] programme and funding. In 1986, the school obtained a diplomatic status in Senegal with the headquarters agreement. In 1998, Guinea (Conakry) joined the other seven countries as founding state.

== Activities ==

The organisation is involved in initial training, continuous training and research.

'''End-sequence profiling (ESP)''' (sometimes “Paired-end mapping (PEM)”) is a method based on sequence-tagged connectors developed to facilitate [[wikt: de novo|''de novo'']] genome sequencing to identify high-resolution copy number and structural aberrations such as [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] and [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]. &lt;br /&gt;[[File:Working flow ESP.jpeg|thumb|Work flow of End-sequence profiling]]
Briefly, the target genomic DNA is isolated and partially digested with restriction enzymes into large fragments. Following size-fractionation, the fragments are cloned into plasmids to construct artificial chromosomes such as [[bacterial artificial chromosomes]] (BAC) which are then sequenced and compared to the reference genome. The differences, including orientation and length variations between constructed chromosomes and the reference genome, will suggest copy number and structural aberration.

== Artificial chromosome construction ==
[[File:BAC work flow ESP.jpg|thumb|Work flow of bacteria artificial chromosome construction]]Before analyzing target genome structural aberration and copy number variation (CNV) with ESP, the target genome is usually amplified and conserved with artificial chromosome construction. The classic strategy to construct an artificial chromosome is [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] (BAC). Basically, the target chromosome is randomly digested and inserted into plasmids which are transformed and cloned in bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Connor|first1=M|last2=Peifer|first2=M|last3=Bender|first3=W|title=Construction of large DNA segments in Escherichia coli.|journal=Science|date=16 June 1989|volume=244|issue=4910|pages=1307–12|pmid=2660262|doi=10.1126/science.2660262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of fragments inserted is 150–350 kb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=NE|last2=Fan|first2=JB|last3=Willour|first3=V|last4=Pennacchio|first4=LA|last5=Warrington|first5=JA|last6=Hu|first6=A|last7=de la Chapelle|first7=A|last8=Lehesjoki|first8=AE|last9=Cox|first9=DR|last10=Myers|first10=RM|title=Construction of a 750-kb bacterial clone contig and restriction map in the region of human chromosome 21 containing the progressive myoclonus epilepsy gene.|journal=Genome Research|date=March 1996|volume=6|issue=3|pages=218–25|pmid=8963899|doi=10.1101/gr.6.3.218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly used artificial chromosome is fosmid. The difference between BAC and fosmids is the size of the DNA inserted. Fosmids can only hold 40 kb DNA fragments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuzun|first1=Eray|last2=Sharp|first2=Andrew J|last3=Bailey|first3=Jeffrey A|last4=Kaul|first4=Rajinder|last5=Morrison|first5=V Anne|last6=Pertz|first6=Lisa M|last7=Haugen|first7=Eric|last8=Hayden|first8=Hillary|last9=Albertson|first9=Donna|last10=Pinkel|first10=Daniel|last11=Olson|first11=Maynard V|last12=Eichler|first12=Evan E|title=Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome|journal=Nature Genetics|date=15 May 2005|volume=37|issue=7|pages=727–732|doi=10.1038/ng1562|pmid=15895083}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows a more accurate breakpoint determination.

== Structural aberration detection ==
End sequence profiling (ESP) can be used to detect structural variations such as insertions, deletions, and chromosomal rearrangement. Compare to other methods that look at chromosomal abnormalities, ESP is particularly useful to identify copy neutral abnormalities such as inversions and translocations that would not be apparent when looking at copy number variation.&lt;ref name=plos2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bashir|first1=Ali|last2=Volik|first2=Stanislav|last3=Collins|first3=Colin|last4=Bafna|first4=Vineet|last5=Raphael|first5=Benjamin J.|last6=Ouzounis|first6=Christos A.|title=Evaluation of Paired-End Sequencing Strategies for Detection of Genome Rearrangements in Cancer|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=25 April 2008|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e1000051|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000051|pmid=18404202|pmc=2278375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=proceedings&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volik|first1=S.|last2=Zhao|first2=S.|last3=Chin|first3=K.|last4=Brebner|first4=J. H.|last5=Herndon|first5=D. R.|last6=Tao|first6=Q.|last7=Kowbel|first7=D.|last8=Huang|first8=G.|last9=Lapuk|first9=A.|last10=Kuo|first10=W.-L.|last11=Magrane|first11=G.|last12=de Jong|first12=P.|last13=Gray|first13=J.

Detection of variations is then achieved by mapping the sequenced reads onto a reference genome.

=== Inversion and translocation ===
Inversions and translocations are relatively easy to detect by an invalid pair of sequenced-end. For instance, a translocation can be detected if the paired-ends are mapped onto different chromosomes on the reference genome.&lt;ref name=plos2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=proceedings /&gt; Inversion can be detected by divergent orientation of the reads, where the insert will have two plus-end or two minus-end.
[[File:Structural Aberration PEM modified.jpeg|thumb|Chromosome rearrangements detected by ESP]]

=== Insertion and deletion ===
In the case of an insertion or a deletion, mapping of the paired-end is consistent with the reference genome. But the read are disconcordant in apparent size. The apparent size is the distance of the BAC sequenced-ends mapped in the reference genome. If a BAC has an insert of length (l), a concordant mapping will show a fragment of size (l) in the reference genome. If the paired-ends are closer than distance (l), an insertion is suspected in the sampled DNA. A distance of (l&lt; µ-3σ) can be used as a cut-off to detect an insertion, where µ is the mean length of the insert and σ is the standard deviation.&lt;ref name=proceedings /&gt;&lt;ref name=yang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=R|last2=Chen|first2=L|last3=Newman|first3=S|last4=Gandhi|first4=K|last5=Doho|first5=G|last6=Moreno|first6=CS|last7=Vertino|first7=PM|last8=Bernal-Mizarchi|first8=L|last9=Lonial|first9=S|last10=Boise|first10=LH|last11=Rossi|first11=M|last12=Kowalski|first12=J|last13=Qin|first13=ZS|title=Integrated analysis of whole-genome paired-end and mate-pair sequencing data for identifying genomic structural variations in multiple myeloma.|journal=Cancer informatics|date=2014|volume=13|issue=Suppl 2|pages=49–53|pmid=25288879|doi=10.4137/CIN.S13783|pmc=4179644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of a deletion, the paired-ends are mapped further away in the reference genome compared to the expected distance (l&gt; µ-3σ).&lt;ref name=yang /&gt;

=== Copy number variation ===
[[File:Copy number alteration modified ESP.jpg|thumb|Copy number alterations detected by ESP]]
In some cases, discordant reads can also indicate a [[Copy-number variation|CNV]] for example in sequences repeats. For larger CNV, the density of the reads will vary accordingly to the copy number. An increase of copy numbers will be reflected by increasing mapping of the same region on the reference genome.

== ESP history ==
ESP was first developed and published in 2003 by Dr. Collins and his colleagues in University of California, San Francisco. Their study revealed the chromosome rearrangements and CNV of MCF7 human cancer cells at a 150kb resolution, which is much more accurate compared to both CGH and spectral karyotyping at that time.&lt;ref name=proceedings /&gt; In 2007, Dr. Snyder and his group improved the ESP to 3kb resolution by sequencing both pairs of 3-kb DNA fragments without BAC construction. Their approach is able to identify deletions, inversions, insertions with an average breakpoint resolution of 644bp, which close to the resolution of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbel|first1=JO|last2=Urban|first2=AE|last3=Affourtit|first3=JP|last4=Godwin|first4=B|last5=Grubert|first5=F|last6=Simons|first6=JF|last7=Kim|first7=PM|last8=Palejev|first8=D|last9=Carriero|first9=NJ|last10=Du|first10=L|last11=Taillon|first11=BE|last12=Chen|first12=Z|last13=Tanzer|first13=A|last14=Saunders|first14=AC|last15=Chi|first15=J|last16=Yang|first16=F|last17=Carter|first17=NP|last18=Hurles|first18=ME|last19=Weissman|first19=SM|last20=Harkins|first20=TT|last21=Gerstein|first21=MB|last22=Egholm|first22=M|last23=Snyder|first23=M|title=Paired-end mapping reveals extensive structural variation in the human genome.|journal=Science|date=19 October 2007|volume=318|issue=5849|pages=420–6|pmid=17901297|doi=10.1126/science.1149504|pmc=2674581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESP applications ==
Various bioinformatics tools can be used to analyze end-sequence profiling. Common ones include BreakDancer, PEMer, Variation Hunter, common LAW, GASV, and Spanner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Min|last2=Wang|first2=Qingguo|last3=Wang|first3=Quan|last4=Jia|first4=Peilin|last5=Zhao|first5=Zhongming|title=Computational tools for copy number variation (CNV) detection using next-generation sequencing data: features and perspectives|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2013|volume=14|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S1|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-S11-S1|pmid=24564169|pmc=3846878}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESP can be used to map structural variation at high-resolution in disease tissue. This technique is mainly used on tumor samples from different cancer types. Accurate identification of copy neutral chromosomal abnormalities is particularly important as translocation can lead to fusion proteins, chimeric proteins, or misregulated proteins that can be seen in tumors. This technique can also be used in evolution studies by identifying large structural variation between different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbel|first1=J. O.|last2=Urban|first2=A. E.|last3=Affourtit|first3=J. P.|last4=Godwin|first4=B.|last5=Grubert|first5=F.|last6=Simons|first6=J. F.|last7=Kim|first7=P. M.|last8=Palejev|first8=D.|last9=Carriero|first9=N.

For example, a barcoded Illumina paired-end sequencing (BIPES) approach was used to assess microbial diversity by sequencing the 16S V6 tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Hong-Wei|last2=Li|first2=Dong-Fang|last3=Tam|first3=Nora Fung-Yee|last4=Jiang|first4=Xiao-Tao|last5=Zhang|first5=Hai|last6=Sheng|first6=Hua-Fang|last7=Qin|first7=Jin|last8=Liu|first8=Xiao|last9=Zou|first9=Fei|title=BIPES, a cost-effective high-throughput method for assessing microbial diversity|journal=The ISME Journal|date=21 October 2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=741–749|doi=10.1038/ismej.2010.160|pmc=3105743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and limitations ==
Resolution of structural variation detection by ESP has been increased to the similar level as PCR, and can be further improved by selection of more evenly sized DNA fragments. ESP can be applied for either with or without constructed artificial chromosome. With BAC, precious samples can be immortalized and conserved, which is particularly important for small quantity of smalls which are planned for extensive analyses. Furthermore, BACs carrying rearranged DNA fragments can be directly transfected ''in vitro'' or ''in vivo'' to analyze the function of these arrangements. However, BAC construction is still expensive and labor-intensive. Researchers should be really careful to choose which strategy they need for particular project. Because ESP only looks at short paired-end sequences, it has the advantage of providing useful information genome-wide without the need for large-scale sequencing. Approximately 100-200 tumors can be sequenced at a resolution greater than 150kb when compared to sequencing an entire genome.

'''Entomopathogenic nematodes''' are a group of nematodes (thread worms), causing death to insects. The term ''entomopathogenic'' has a Greek origin ''entomon,'' refers to insect, and [[pathogenic]], which denotes causing disease. They are multi-cellular metazoans that occupy a bio control middle ground between microbial pathogens and predator/ parasitoids, and are habitually grouped with pathogens, most likely because of their symbiotic relationship with bacteria. Although many other parasitic thread worms cause diseases in living organisms (sterilizing or otherwise debilitating their host), entomopathogenic nematodes, are specific in only infecting insects. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) live parasitically inside the infected insect [[Host (biology)|host]], and so they are termed as ''endoparasitic''. They infect many different types of insects living in the soil like the [[larva]]l forms of moths, butterflies, flies and beetles as well as adult forms of beetles, grasshoppers and crickets. EPNs have been found in all over the world and a range of ecologically diverse habitats. They are highly diverse, complex and specialized. The most commonly studied entomopathogenic nematodes are those that can be used in the [[biological pest control|biological control]] of harmful insects, the members of [[Steinernematidae]] and [[Heterorhabditidae]] (Gaugler 2006). They are the only insect-parasitic nematodes possessing an optimal balance of biological control attributes. (Cranshaw &amp; Zimmerman 2013).

== Life cycle ==
Because of their economic importance, the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]s of the genera belonging to families Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae are well studied. Although not closely related, [[phylogenetic]]ally, both share similar life histories (Poinar 1993). The cycle begins with an infective juvenile, whose only function is to seek out and infect new hosts. When a host has been located, the nematodes penetrate into the insect body cavity, usually via natural body openings (mouth, anus, spiracles) or areas of thin cuticle. (Shapiro-Ilan, David I., and Randy Gaugler. "Nematodes.")  After entering an insect, infective juveniles release an associated mutualistic bacterium from their gut which multiplies rapidly. These bacteria of the genus ''Xenorhabdus'' or ''Photorhabdus'', for steinerernematides and heterorhabditids, respectively—cause host mortality within 24-48 hours. The nematodes provide shelter to the bacteria, which, in return, kill the insect host and provide nutrients to the nematode. Together, the nematodes and bacteria feed on the liquefying host, and reproduce for several generations inside the [[cadaver]] maturing through the growth stages of J2-J4 into adults. Steinernematids infective juveniles may become males or females, whereas heterorhabditids develop into self-fertilizing [[hermaphrodite]]s with later generations producing two sexes. When food resources in the host become scarce, the adults produce new infective juveniles adapted to withstand the outside environment. The life cycles of the EPNs are completed within a few days.(Shapiro-Ilan, David I., and Randy Gaugler. "Nematodes.") After about a week, hundreds of thousands of infective juveniles emerge and leave in search of new hosts, carrying with them an inoculation of mutualistic bacteria, received from the internal host environment (Boemare 2002, Gaugler 2006). Their growth and reproduction depends upon conditions established in the host [[cadaver]] by the bacterium. The nematodes bacterium contributes anti-immune proteins to assist in overcoming their host defenses.(Shapiro-Ilan, David I., and Randy Gaugler. "Nematodes.") 

==Foraging strategies==
The foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes vary between species, influencing their soil depth distributions and host preferences. Infective juveniles use strategies to find hosts that vary from [[ambush]] and cruise foraging (Campbell 1997). In order to ambush prey, some ''Steinernema'' species nictate, or raise their bodies off the soil surface so they are better poised to attach to passing insects, which are much larger in size (Campbell and Gaugler 1993). Many ''Steinernema'' are able to jump by forming a loop with their bodies that creates stored energy which, when released, propels them through the air (Campbell and Kaya 2000). Other species adopt a cruising strategy and rarely nictate. Instead, they roam through the soil searching for potential hosts. These foraging strategies influence which hosts the nematodes infect. For example, ambush predators such as ''Steinernema carpocapsae'' infect more insects on the surface, while cruising predators like ''Heterorhabditis bacteriophora'' infect insects that live deep in the soil (Campbell and Gaugler 1993).

==Population ecology==

===Competition and coexistence===
Inside their insect hosts, EPNs experience both intra and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition takes place among nematodes of the same species when the number of infective juveniles penetrating a host exceeds the amount of resources available. Interspecific competition occurs when different species compete for resources. In both cases, the individual nematodes compete with each other indirectly by consuming the same resource, which reduces their fitness and may result in the local extinction of one species inside the host (Koppenhofer and Kaya 1996). Interference competition, in which species compete directly, can also occur. For example, a steinernematid species that infects a host first usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for this superiority may be antibiotics produced by ''Xenorhabdus'', the symbiotic bacterium of the steinernematid. These antibiotics prevent the symbiotic bacterium of the heterorhabditid from multiplying (Kaya and Koppenhofer1996). In order to avoid competition, some species of infective juveniles are able to judge the quality of a host before penetration. The infective juveniles of ''S. carpocapsae'' are repelled by 24-hour-old infections, likely by the smell of their own species’ mutualistic bacteria (Grewal ''et al.'' 1997).

Interspecific competition between nematode species can also occur in the soil environment outside of hosts. Millar and Barbercheck (2001) showed that the introduced nematode ''Steinernema riobrave'' survived and persisted in the environment for up to a year after its release. ''S. riobrave'' significantly depressed detection of the [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] nematode ''H. bacteriophora'', but never completely displaced it, even after two years of continued introductions. ''S. riobrave'' had no effect on populations of the [[wiktionary:native|native]] nematode, ''S. carpocapsae'', though, which suggests that coexistence is possible. [[Niche differentiation]] appears to limit competition between nematodes. Different foraging strategies allow two species to co-exist in the same habitat. Different foraging strategies separate the nematodes in space and enable them to infect different hosts. EPNs also occur in patchy distributions, which may limit their interactions and further support coexistence (Kaya and Koppenhofer 1996).

===Population distribution===
Entomopathogenic nematodes are typically found in patchy distributions, which vary in space and time, although the degree of patchiness varies between species (reviewed in Lewis 2002). Factors responsible for this aggregated distribution may include behavior, as well as the spatial and temporal variability of the nematodes natural enemies, like nematode trapping fungus. Nematodes also have limited dispersal ability. Many infective juveniles are produced from a single host which could also produce aggregates. Patchy EPN distributions may also reflect the uneven distribution of host and nutrients in the soil (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998; Stuart and Gaugler 1994; Campbell ''et al.'' 1997, 1998). EPNs may persist as [[metapopulation]]s, in which local population fragments are highly vulnerable to extinction, and fluctuate asynchronously (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998). The metapopulation as a whole can persist as long as the rate of colonization is greater or equal to the rate of population extinction (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998). The founding of new populations and movement between patches may depend on the movement of infective juveniles or the movement of infected hosts (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998). Recent studies suggest that EPNs may also use non-host animals, such as [[isopod]]s and [[earthworm]]s for transport (Eng ''et al.''2005, Shapiro ''et al.'' 1993) or can be scavengers (San-Blas and Gowen, 2008).

==Community ecology==
Parasites can significantly affect their hosts, as well as the structure of the [[biocoenosis|communities]] to which they and their hosts belong (Minchella and Scott 1991). Entomopathogenic nematodes have the potential to shape the [[populations]] of plants and host insects, as well as the species composition of the surrounding animal soil community.

Entomopathogenic nematodes affect populations of their insect hosts by killing and consuming individuals. When more EPNs are added to a field environment, typically at concentrations of 250,000 individuals per square metre, the population of host insects measurably decreases (Campbell et al. 1998, Strong et al. 1996). Agriculture exploits this finding, and the inundative release of EPNs can effectively control populations of soil insect pests in citrus, cranberries, turfgrass, and tree fruit (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998).
If entomopathogenic nematodes suppress the population of insect root herbivores, they indirectly benefit plants by freeing them from grazing pressure. This is an example of a [[trophic cascade]] in which consumers at the top of the [[food web]] (nematodes) exert an influence on the abundance of resources (plants) at the bottom. The idea that plants can benefit from the application of their herbivore’s enemies is the principle behind [[biological control]]. Consequently, much of EPN biological research is driven by agricultural applications.

Examples of the top-down effects of entomopathogenic nematodes are not restricted to agricultural systems. Researchers at the Bodega Marine Laboratory examined the strong top-down effects that naturally occurring EPNs can have on their ecosystem (Strong ''et al.'' 1996). In a coastal shrubland food chain the native EPN, ''Heterorhabditis heplialus'', parasitized ghost moth caterpillars, and ghost moth caterpillars consumed the roots of bush lupine. The presence ''H. heplialus'' correlated with lower caterpillar numbers and healthier plants. In addition, the researchers observed high mortality of bush lupine in the absence of EPNs. Old aerial photographs over the past 40 years indicated that the stands where nematodes were prevalent had little or no mass die-off of lupine. In stands with low nematode prevalence, however, the photos showed repeated lupine die-offs. These results implied that the nematode, as a natural enemy of the ghost moth caterpillar, protected the plant from damage. The authors even suggested that the interaction was strong enough to affect the population dynamics of bush lupine (Strong ''et al.'' 1996).

Not only do entomopathogenic nematodes affect their host insects, they can also change the species composition of the soil community. Many familiar animals like earthworms and insect grubs live in the soil, but smaller invertebrates such as [[mite]]s, collembolans, and [[nematode]]s are also common. Aside from EPNs, the soil ecosystem includes [[predatory]], [[bacteriovorous]], [[fungivorous]] and plant parasitic nematode species. Since EPNs are applied in agricultural systems at a rate of 1,000,000 individuals per acre, the potential for [[unintended consequence]]s on the soil ecosystem appears large. EPNs have not had an adverse effect on mite and collembolan populations (Georgis et al. 1991), yet there is strong evidence that they affect the species diversity of other nematodes. In a golf course ecosystem, the application of ''H. bacteriophora'', an introduced nematode, significantly reduced the abundance, species richness, maturity, and diversity of the nematode community (Somaseker ''et al.'' 2002). EPNs had no effect on free-living nematodes. However, there was a reduction in the number of genera and abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes, which often remain enclosed within growths on the plant root. The mechanism by which insect parasitic nematodes have an effect on plant parasitic nematodes remains unknown. Although this effect is considered beneficial for agricultural systems where plant parasitic nematodes cause crop damage, it raises the question of what other effects are possible. Future research on the impacts EPNs have on soil communities will lead to greater understanding of these interactions.

In aboveground communities, EPNs have few side effects on other animals. One study reported that ''Steinernema felidae'' and ''Heterorhabditis megidis'', when applied in a range of agricultural and natural habitats, had little impact on non-pest arthropods. Some minimal impacts did occur, however, on non-pest species of beetles and flies (Bathon 1996). Unlike chemical pesticides, EPNs are considered safe for humans and other vertebrates.

==Disturbance==
Frequent disturbance often perturbs agricultural habitats and the response to disturbance varies among EPN species. In traditional agricultural systems, tilling disturbs the soil ecosystem, affecting biotic and abiotic factors. For example, tilled soils have lower microbial, arthropod, and nematode species diversity (Lupwayi ''et al.'' 1998). Tilled soil also has less moisture and higher temperatures. In a study examining the tolerances of different EPN species to tillage, the density of a native nematode, ''H. bacteriophora'', was unaffected by tillage, while the density of an introduced nematode, ''S. carpocapsae'', decreased. The density of a third nematode introduced to the system, ''Steinernema riobrave'', increased with tillage (Millar and Barbercheck 2002). Habitat preferences in temperature and soil depth can partially explain the nematodes’ different responses to disturbance. ''S. carpocapsae'' prefers to remain near the soil surface and so is more vulnerable to soil disturbance than ''H. bacteriophora'', which forages deeper and can escape the effects of tillage. ''S. riobrave'' may have responded well to tillage because it is better at surviving and persisting in hotter and drier conditions created by tillage (Millar and Barbercheck 2002).  The data showed that ''Steinernema'' sp. found in some Indonesia regions showed high adaptive capability when applied on another region or condition (Anton Muhibuddin, 2008). The response of EPNs to other forms of disturbance is less well defined. Nematodes are not affected by certain pesticides and are able to survive flooding. The effects of natural disturbances such as fire have not been examined.

==Applications==
Although the biological control industry has acknowledged EPNs since the 1980s, relatively little is understood about their biology in natural and managed ecosystems (Georgis 2002). Nematode-host interactions are poorly understood, and more than half of the natural hosts for recognized Steinernema and Heterorhabditis species remain unknown (Akhurst and Smith 2002). Information is lacking because isolates of naturally infected hosts are rare, so native nematodes are often baited using ''Galleria mellonella'', a lepidopteran that is highly susceptible to parasitic infection. Laboratory studies showing wide host ranges for EPNs were often overestimates, because in a laboratory, contact with a host is assured and environmental conditions are ideal; there are no "ecological barriers" to infection (Kaya and Gaugler 1993, Gaugler ''et al.'' 1997). Therefore, the broad host range initially predicted by assay results has not always translated into insecticidal success. 

Nematodes are open to mass production and don’t require specialized application equipment since they are compatible with standard agrochemical equipment, including various sprayers (i.e. backpack, pressurized, mist, electrostatic, fan and aerial) and irrigation systems.(Cranshaw, &amp; Zimmerman 2013). 

The lack of knowledge about nematode ecology has resulted in unanticipated failures to control pests in the field. For example, parasitic nematodes were found to be completely ineffective against blackflies and mosquitoes due to their inability to swim (Lewis ''et al.''1998). Efforts to control foliage-feeding pests with EPNs were equally unsuccessful, because nematodes are highly sensitive to UV light and [[desiccation]] (Lewis ''et al.''1998). Comparing the life histories of nematodes and target pests can often explain such failures (Gaugler ''et al.'' 1997). Each nematode species has a unique array of characteristics, including different environmental tolerances, dispersal tendencies, and foraging behaviors (Lewis ''et al.'' 1998). Increased knowledge about the factors that influence EPN populations and the impacts they have in their communities will likely increase their efficacy as biological control agents.

Recently, studies have shown utilizing both EPNs (steinernematids and heterorhabditids) in combination for biological control of plum curculio in orchards in Northeast America have reduce populations by as much as 70-90% in the field, depending on insect stage, treatment timing and field conditions. More studies are being conducted for the efficacy of EPNs utilized as a biological control agent for organic growers as an alternative solution to chemistries that aren't as effective at controlling insect infestations.(Agnello, Jentsch, Shield, Testa, and Keller 2014).

'''''Ephebos''''' (ἔφηβος) (often in the plural '''''epheboi'''''), also anglicised as '''''ephebe''''' (plural: '''''ephebes''''') or archaically '''''ephebus''''' (plural: '''''ephebi'''''), is a [[Greek language|Greek]] term for a male [[adolescent]], or for a social status reserved for that age, in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

==History==
===Greece===
[[Image:Kouros' Head, Acropolis' museum, Athens.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis]] museum in [[Athens]].]]
Though the word can simply refer to the adolescent age of young men of training age, its main use is for the members, exclusively from that age group, of an official institution (''ephebeia'') that saw to building them into citizens, but especially training them as soldiers, sometimes already sent into the field; the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]] (''[[polis]]'') mainly depended, as the [[Roman republic]] before [[Gaius Marius]]' reform, on its militia of citizens for defense.

In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 18, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.

===Rome===
In Rome, where the elite (mainly [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the [[Latin]]ate form ''ephebus'' (plural ''ephebi''), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.

==Sculpture==
In [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], an '''ephebe''' is a sculptural type depicting a nude ''ephebos'' ([[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] examples of the type are also often known as the [[kouros]] type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form "the ''{{var|X}} Ephebe''", where {{var|X}} is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the ''Agrigento Ephebe'').

'''Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz''' (2 August 1924 – 20 August 2013) was a French historian and archaeologist. As an archaeologist he worked at [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]]. He has published numerous books including works on Qumran and the context of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

Laperrousaz is now ''professeur honoraire'' of the religious studies faculty of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and was formerly the director of that institution. He was a resident at the [[École Biblique|École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem]]. He has long been acquainted with Qumran, having been a participant in the excavations directed by [[Roland de Vaux]] from 1953 to 1956. From 1970 to 1995 Laperrousaz continued an archaeological mission to Jerusalem and the Qumran area on a yearly basis. Always a strong believer in the [[Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Qumran–Essene Theory|Qumran-Essene hypothesis]], he differed with de Vaux over interpretations of the site of Qumran. His most influential work is ''Qoumran: L'Etablissement essénien des bord de la Mer Morte: Histoire et archéologie du site'', an independent study of the archaeology of Qumran.

== Selected publications ==
Laperrousaz has been a prolific writer on archaeological subjects in French. Among his books are:

==Description==
When stressed, the sea cucumber faces away from the attacker and contracts its body wall muscles sharply. This causes the wall of the cloaca to tear and the anus to gape.  The evisceration process in ''[[Eupentacta quinquesemita]]'' proceeds as follows:&lt;ref name="Learn about sea cucumbers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Byrne, M.|year=1985|title=Evisceration behaviour and the seasonal incidence of evisceration in the Holothurian ''Eupentacta quinquestemita'' (Selenka)|journal=Ophelia|volume=24|issue=2|pages=75–90|doi=10.1080/00785236.1985.10426621|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00785236.1985.10426621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Byrne, M.|year=2001|title= The morphology of autotomy structures in the sea cucumber ''Eupentacta quinquesemita'' before and during evisceration|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|pages=849–863|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/5/849.long|pmid=11171409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Three main structures weaken over a period of about 1–3 minutes, become soft and transparent, and eventually separate from their attachments.  These are the basal part of the [[tentacles]], the attachment points of the introvert retractor muscles to the longitudinal [[muscles]] (there are 10 of these), and the junction of [[intestine]] and [[cloaca]]. The softening is a state-transformation of the [[collagen]] components in the tissue.
#Parts eviscerated include the gut, associated haemal vessels, tentacles, and introvert (the dexterous [[anterior]] extensible portion of the body wall).  The gut tears away from the [[mesenteries]] that suspend it within the [[coelomic cavity]].
#Most of the [[gonad]] stays behind.  Only strands of gonad tangled in the gut are eviscerated. The paired respiratory trees and cloaca also remain (although they may be expelled in other species)
#The introvert changes from being firm and opaque to being soft and translucent.  The body-wall muscles contract and the increased pressure forces [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] and viscera into the introvert.  It enlarges like a balloon and soon ruptures, expelling the fluid and viscera.
#This takes about 20 minutes, with final detachment of the tentacles and introvert sometimes taking as long as 12 hours.
#The anterior rupture seals, at first by muscular contraction and then by healing as a plug of connective-tissue.

==Function==
During evisceration in some species, several hundred [[Cuvierian tubules]] (part of the respiratory tree) may be expelled. Water from the respiratory tree is forced into these tubules causing a rapid expansion and they elongate by up to twenty times their original length. They have great tensile strength and become sticky when they encounter any object. The adhesive is unique among marine invertebrates and a firm grip is obtained in under ten seconds. The mass of threads can entangle and immobilise potential predators such as small [[fish]] or [[crab]]s. The threads [[Autotomy|become detached]] from the sea cucumber which crawls away.&lt;ref name=Flammang/&gt; The tubules are readily regenerated, a process that takes about seventeen days in ''[[Holothuria leucospilota]]'' and five weeks in ''[[Holothuria forskali]]''.&lt;ref name="Flammang" /&gt; The tubules contain a toxic [[saponin]] called [[holothurin]], which is also present in the body wall in some sea cucumber species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes, |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The giant California sea cucumber (''[[Parastichopus californicus]]'') will often eviscerate due to rough handling, temperature shock, or other stressful treatments.  The event occurs through the anus and the eviscerated parts are mainly the respiratory trees.

''Holothuria arenicola'' is described as a sea cucumber suitable for keeping in aquaria as it does not eviscerate, whereas the "Australian" sea apple (''Paracucumaria tricolor'') frequently eviscerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetwebmedia.com/seacukes.htm|title=Sea cucumbers: Not a pretty picture|author=Fenner, B.|publisher=WetWebMedia.com|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar behaviour==
Some [[starfish]] evert their stomachs through their mouths to eat their prey.  The starfish then retracts its stomach back inside of its body.&lt;ref name=Carefootfeeding&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asnailsodyssey.com/LEARNABOUT/SEASTAR/seasAdul.php | title=Adult feeding | publisher=A Snail's Odyssey | work=Sea Stars: Feeding, growth, &amp; regeneration | accessdate=August 14, 2013 | author=Carefoot, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">'''Exploratory search''' is a specialization of information exploration which represents the activities carried out by searchers who are:&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White and Resa A. Roth (2009). ''Exploratory Search: Beyond the Query-Response Paradigm'', San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool.&lt;/ref&gt;
* unfamiliar with the domain of their goal (i.e. need to learn about the topic in order to understand how to achieve their goal)
* or unsure about the ways to achieve their goals (either the technology or the process)
* or unsure about their goals in the first place.

Consequently, exploratory search covers a broader class of activities than typical [[information retrieval]], such as investigating, evaluating, comparing, and synthesizing, where new information is sought in a defined conceptual area; exploratory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[exploratory data analysis|data analysis]] is another example of an information exploration activity. Typically, therefore, such users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation.

==History==
Exploratory search is a topic that has grown from the fields of [[information retrieval]] and [[information seeking]] but has become more concerned with alternatives to the kind of search that has received the majority of focus (returning the most relevant documents to a [[Google]]-like keyword search). The research is motivated by questions like "what if the user doesn't know which keywords to use?" or "what if the user isn't looking for a single answer?". Consequently, research has begun to focus on defining the broader set of ''information behaviors'' in order to learn about the situations when a user is, or feels, limited by only having the ability to perform a keyword search.

In the last few years,{{When|date=April 2016}} a series of workshops has been held at various related and key events. In 2005, the Exploratory Search Interfaces workshop focused on beginning to define some of the key challenges in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/xsi/index.html|title=HCIL SOH 2005 Workshop on Exploratory Search Interfaces|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then a series of other workshops has been held at related conferences: Evaluating Exploratory Search&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/eess/index.html|title=SIGIR 2006 Workshop - Evaluating Exploratory Search Systems|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at SIGIR06&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigir2006.org|title=Sigir 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Exploratory Search and HCI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/esi/index.html|title=CHI 2007 Workshop - Exploratory Search and HCI|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at CHI07&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chi2007.org|title=CHI 2007 Reach Beyond - welcome|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in order to meet with the experts in [[human–computer interaction]]).

In March 2008, an ''Information Processing and Management'' special issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03064573|title=Information Processing &amp; Management|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White, Gary Marchionini, Gheorghe Muresan (2008). ''Evaluating exploratory search systems: Introduction to special topic issue of information processing and management'' Vol. 44, Issue 2, (2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;433–436&lt;/ref&gt; focused particularly on the challenges of evaluating exploratory search, given the reduced assumptions that can be made about scenarios of use.

In June 2008, the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an invitational workshop to identify a research agenda for exploratory search and similar fields for the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ils.unc.edu/ISSS_workshop/|title=Moved|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research challenges==

===Important scenarios===
With the majority of research in the [[information retrieval]] community focusing on typical keyword search scenarios, one challenge for exploratory search is to further understand the scenarios of use for when keyword search is not sufficient. An example scenario, often used to motivate the research by mSpace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mspace.fm mSpace]&lt;/ref&gt; states: if a user does not know much about classical music, how should they even begin to find a piece that they might like. Similarly, for patients or their carers, if they don't know the right keywords for their health problems, how can they effectively find useful health information for themselves?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pang|first1=PCI|last2=Verspoor|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=S|last4=Pearce|first4=J|title=Conceptualising health information seeking behaviours and exploratory search: result of a qualitative study|journal=Health and Technology|date=2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=45-55|doi=10.1007/s12553-015-0096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designing new interfaces===
With one of the motivations being to support users when keyword search is not enough, some research has focused on identifying alternative user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. An example is [[Faceted classification|faceted search]] which presents diverse category-style options to the users, so that they can choose from a list instead of guess a possible keyword query.

Many of the [[human–computer information retrieval|interactive forms of search]], including [[faceted browser]]s, are being considered for their support of exploratory search conditions.

Computational cognitive models of exploratory search have been developed to capture the cognitive complexities involved in exploratory search. Model-based dynamic presentation of information cues are proposed to facilitate exploratory search performance.&lt;ref&gt;Fu, W.-T., Kannampalill, T. G., &amp; Kang, R. (2010). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719970.1719998 Facilitating exploratory search by model-based navigational cues.] In Proceedings of the ACM International conference on Intelligent User Interface. 199–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluating interfaces===
As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are largely undefined or unpredictable, it is very hard to evaluate systems with the measures often used in information retrieval. Accuracy was typically used to show that a user had found a correct answer, but when the user is trying to summarize a domain of information, the ''correct'' answer is near impossible to identify, if not entirely subjective (for example: possible hotels to stay in Paris). In exploration, it is also arguable that spending more time (where time efficiency is typically desirable) researching a topic shows that a system provides increased support for investigation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving study participants a well specified task could immediately prevent them from exhibiting exploratory behavior.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Models of exploratory search behavior===
There have been recent{{When|date=April 2016}} attempts to develop a process model of exploratory search behavior, especially in social information system (e.g., see [[models of collaborative tagging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

These models provided extension to existing process model of information search that characterizes information-seeking behavior in traditional fact-retrievals using search engines.&lt;ref&gt;

Such predictive user modeling, also referred as intent modeling, can help users to get accustomed to a body of [[domain knowledge]] and help users to make sense of the potential directions to be explored around their initial, often vague, expression of information needs.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}
'''"Only one eye for one eye"'''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1945 | pp = 571ff}}, also known as '''"An eye for an eye"''' or '''"A tooth for a tooth"''', or the '''law of retaliation''', is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} The intent behind the principle was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}

The principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term '''''lex talionis''''' or '''the law of talion'''. The English word talion (from the [[Latin]]'' [[wikt:talio#Noun 3|talio]]''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}) means a retaliation authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.

==Definition and methods==
The term '''''lex talionis''''' does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather [[mirror punishment]]) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Douglas A | last1 = Knight | first2 = Amy-Jill | last2 = Levine | year = 2011 | title = The Meaning of the Bible| publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-06-112175-3 |page = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common expression of lex talionis is "an eye for an eye", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of ''lex talionis'' have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a [[felony]]. In the famous legal [[Code of Hammurabi|code]] written by [[Hammurabi]], the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC | loc = §230}}

The simplest example is the "eye for an eye" principle.  In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the twelve tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of [[wergild]] for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern [[tort]] law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well.  The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is "The law of retaliation." The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.

==Antecedents==
Various ideas regarding the origins of ''lex talionis'' exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, [[feud]]s and [[Feud|vendettas]], threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, ''lex talionis'' systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.

The principle is found in [[Babylonian Law]].{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bond |first=Kenneth |year=1998 |quote=...Code of Hammurabi (1780 BC).  I used a translation by LW King with Commentary by Charles F. Horne (1915). My version was a 1996 electronically enhanced version of the 1910 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. |url=http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |title=Religious Beliefs as a Basis for Ethical Decision Making in the Workplace |publisher=[[Humboldt State University]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703102021/http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take [[revenge|vengeful]] retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society.  As with [[blasphemy]] or [[lèse-majesté]] (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.

[[Roman law]] moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance.  In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although ''talio'' was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507759/Roman-law/41328/Delict-and-contract#ref469137 | contribution = Roman law: Delict and contract | title = Encyclopædia Britannica}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
The principle was first referenced in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which predates the Hebrew bible.  In the Hebrew Law, the "eye for eye" was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}  The idiomatic biblical phrase "an eye for an eye" in Exodus and Leviticus ({{Hebrew|עין תחת עין}}, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally  "eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses.&lt;ref name=lev24&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ex21&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:22–25|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = deut19&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16-21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in [[Leviticus]] states, "And a man who injures his countryman{{snd}}as he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him." (Lev. 24:19–21)&lt;ref name="lev24" /&gt;. For an example of {{Hebrew|תחת}} being used in its regular sense of ''under'', see Lev. 22:27 "A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day..."

===Judaism===
Isaac Kalimi explains that the "lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted "an eye for an eye" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the ''[[peshat]]'' (literal meaning) of the written Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biblical interpretation in Judaism and Christianity |first1= Isaac |last1= Kalimi | first2= Peter J | last2 = Haas | author2-link = Peter Haas (rabbi) | publisher = Continuum | year = 2006 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h6bSc6ksh0YC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=daYBTeziHZKesQPx-_HjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to "adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A concise history of the Jewish people | first1 = Naomi E | last1 = Pasachoff | first2 = Robert J | last2 = Littman | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2005 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=pKoBTe_WDJO8sQPN1aD7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talmud====
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]] | at = 83b–84a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.
{{Quote | The Oral Law explains, based upon the biblical verses, that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation, consisting of payment for "Damages, Pain, Medical Expenses, Incapacitation, and Mental Anguish" — which underlies many modern legal codes. Some rabbinic literature explains, moreover, that the expression, "An eye for an eye, etc." suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye, but that biblical law treats him leniently. − Paraphrased from the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]].&lt;ref name = "OU"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/torah.htm | contribution = Torah | publisher = ou.org | title = About Judaism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase ''ayin tachat ayin'' makes another appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16–21|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to "do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother".&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Makot]] | at = 1:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bab. Talmud | at = 2a}}, based on critical [[exegesis]] of {{bibleverse ||Dt|25:1–3|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot.  There is one case where the Torah states "…and you shall cut off her hand…"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|25:11–12|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner.  This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sifrei]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Maimonides]] | title = Yad}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nezikin | last = Hillel | contribution = Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh | at = 1:7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.

{{bibleverse ||Numbers|35:9–30|JP}} discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of "redeemer of blood". In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the "redeemer of blood" may not kill him.  If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the "redeemer of blood", as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party. Nevertheless, the provision of the "redeemer of blood" does not serve as true reciprocal justice, because the redeemer only acts to penalize a negligent killer who forgoes his exile. Furthermore, intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus cannot serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter, but as a penalty for escaping punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Makot | at = 7a–13a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud.  The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.

====Objective of reciprocal justice in Judaism====
The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (''middah k'neged middah'') in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst"&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"/&gt;) and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:20|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|19:17–18|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hierarchy and reciprocal justice====
In Exodus 21, as in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:23–25|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.&lt;ref name = "Coogan"&gt;{{cite book| last = Coogan | first = Michael D | authorlink = Michael Coogan | title = A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| location = New York| year = 2009| page = 112 | isbn = 978-0-19-533272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the "eye for eye" principle is directly followed by the proclamation "You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan,{{who|date=February 2015}} "to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them."&lt;ref name = "Coogan" /&gt;

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], [[Jesus]] urges his followers to [[turn the other cheek]]:

Some interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Righteous Personal Conduct Interpretation of Turning the Other Cheek|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Righteous_personal_conduct_interpretation|website=Wikepedia|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

[[Christian]] interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the [[Church father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]].

The [[Qur'an]] mentions the "eye for an eye" concept as being ordained for the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = V: 45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in [[Al-Baqara|{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = 2:178}}]]: "O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (''Qisas'') for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.  But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment." Muslim countries that use Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, such as [[Iran]] or Saudi Arabia, apply the "eye for an eye" rule literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7754756.stm | title = Court orders Iranian man blinded | publisher = BBC | date = 28 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/14/acid-blinding-postponed-iran-outcry | title = Acid blinding sentence postponed by Iran after international outcry | newspaper = The Guardian | place = UK | date = 14 May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}
In English [[common law]], '''fee tail''' or '''entail''' is a form of [[Trust law|trust]] established by deed or settlement which restricts the sale or [[inheritance]] of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] and prevents the property from being sold, devised by [[Will (law)|will]], or otherwise [[Alienation (property law)|alienated]] by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically by [[operation of law]] to an heir pre-determined by the settlement deed. The term ''fee tail'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''feodum talliatum'', which means "cut(-short) [[fiefdom|fee]]", and is in contrast to "[[fee simple]]" where no such restriction exists and where the possessor has an absolute title (although subject to the [[allodial title]] of the monarch) in the property which he can bequeath or otherwise dispose of as he wishes. Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere.

==Purpose==
The fee tail allowed a patriarch to perpetuate his blood-line, family-name, honour and armorials&lt;ref&gt;Frequently in default of a son and heir to the tenant-in-possession, the entail required the next male heir, if via a female line, to adopt the surname and arms of the patriarch, see for example [[Mark Rolle]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the persons of a series of powerful and wealthy male descendants. By keeping his estate intact in the hands of one heir alone, in an ideally indefinite and pre-ordained chain of succession, his own wealth, power and family honour would not be dissipated amongst several male lines, as became the case for example in Napoleonic France by operation of the [[Napoleonic Code]] which gave each child the legal right to inherit an equal share of the patrimony, where a formerly great landowning family could be reduced in a few generations to a series of small-holders or peasant farmers. It therefore approaches the true [[corporation]] which is a legal body or person which does not die and continues in existence and can hold wealth indefinitely. Indeed, as a form of trust, whilst the individual trustees may die, replacements are appointed and the trust itself continues, ideally indefinitely. In England almost seamless successions were made from patriarch to patriarch, the smoothness of which were often enhanced by baptising the eldest son and heir with his father's Christian name for several generations, for example the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all named Fulk. Such indefinite inalienable land-holdings were soon seen as restrictive on the optimum productive ability of land, which was often converted to deer-parks or pleasure grounds by the wealthy tenant-in-possession, which was damaging to the nation as a whole, and thus laws against perpetuities were enacted, which restricted entails to a maximum number of lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An entail also had the effect of disabling [[illegitimate child]]ren from inheriting. It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in [[debt]], often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch's widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute. Frequently in such cases the generosity of the settlor left the entailed estate as an uneconomical enterprise, especially during times when the estate's fluctuating agricultural income had to provide for fixed sum annuities. Such impoverished tenants-in-possession were unable to realise in cash any part of their land or even to offer the property as security for a loan, to pay such annuities, unless sanctioned by private Act of Parliament  allowing such sale, which expensive and time-consuming mechanism was frequently resorted to. The ''beneficial owner'' (or tenant-in-possession) of the property in fact had only a [[life interest]] in it, albeit an absolute right to the income it generated, the ''legal owners'' being the trustees of the settlement, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] passing intact to the next [[Inheritance|successor]] or [[heir]] in law; any purported bequest of the land by the tenant-in-possession was ineffective.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
Fee tail was established during [[feudal]] times by [[landed gentry]] to attempt to ensure that the high social standing of the family, as represented by a single patriarch, continued indefinitely. The concentration of the family's wealth into the hands of a single representative was essential to support this  process. Unless the heir had himself inherited the personal and intellectual strengths of the original great patriarch, often a great warrior, which alone had brought him from obscurity to greatness, he would soon sink again into obscurity, and required wealth to maintain his social standing. This feature of English gentry and aristocracy differs from the true aristocracy which existed in pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] France, where all sons of a nobleman inherited his title and were thus inescapably members of a separate noble caste in society. In England all younger sons of a nobleman were born as mere gentlemen and [[commoner]]s, and without the support of wealth  could quickly descend into obscurity, the eldest son alone being a nobleman. On this eldest son was concentrated the honour of the family, and to him alone was granted all its wealth to support his role in that regard, by the process of the fee tail.

===Statute of Westminster 1285===
The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster II]], passed in 1285, created and fixed the form of this estate. The new law was also formally called the statute ''[[De Donis Conditionalibus]]'' (Concerning Conditional Gifts).

===Opponents===
Fee tail was  never popular with the monarchy, the merchant class and many holders of entailed estates themselves who wished to sell their land.

===Abolition===
Fee tail as a legal [[estate (law)|estate]] in England was abolished by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=Jonathan|title=A Dictionary of Law|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199664927|page=258|edition=Eighth|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nTrvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing use===
A fee tail can still exist in England and Wales as an equitable interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested in the current 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but on the basis that any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e. a [[future interest]] where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a [[reversion (law)|reversionary]] fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a [[base fee]]; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.   No new "fees tail" can now be created following the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/schedule/1/paragraph/5 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 Schedule 1 Para 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[conservation easement]]s are a form of entail still in use.

==Creation==
Traditionally, a fee tail was created by a trust established in a [[deed]], often a [[marriage settlement]], or in a will "to A and the heirs of his body". The crucial difference between the words of conveyance and the words that created a [[fee simple]] ("to A and his heirs") is that the heirs "in tail" must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have "fee tail male", which only sons could inherit, and "fee tail female", which only daughters could inherit; and "fee tail special", which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain "heirs of the body" and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions was said to be "entailed" or "held in-tail", with the restrictions themselves known as ''entailments''.

==Breaking of fee tail==
The breaking of a fee tail was simplified by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1833/cukpga_18330074_en_1#l1g3 Fines and Recoveries Act 1833 s.15]&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the conveyance for making a tenant to the [[praecipe]] for suffering a common recovery. This was the usual preliminary to a recovery with a disentailing assurance, which had to be enrolled. The need for this to be followed by the [[Legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]] of a common recovery was abolished.

The requirement that a disentailing assurance should be enrolled was abolished in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property Act 1925, s. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortgage of entailed lands==
Lending upon security of a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] on land in fee tail was risky, since at the death of the tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor in fee tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore  impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Failure of issue==
{{main article|Failure of issue}}
Things did not always go as planned, however. Tenants-in-possession of entailed estates occasionally suffered "failure of issue" – that is, they had no legitimate children surviving them at the time of their deaths. In this situation the entailed land devolved to male cousins, i.e. back up and through the family tree to legitimate male descendants of former tenants-in-possession, or reverted to the last owner in fee simple, if still living. This situation produced complicated [[litigation]] and was an incentive for the production and maintenance of detailed and authoritative family pedigrees and supporting records of marriage, births, baptisms etc.

Depending on how the original deed or grant was worded, in the event of there being daughters but no sons, all the sisters might inherit jointly, it might pass to the eldest sister, it might be held in trust until one of them should produce a (legitimate) son, or it might pass to the next male-line relative (an uncle, say, or even a cousin, sometimes very distant).

==Common recovery==
In the 15th century, lawyers devised  "[[common recovery]]", an elaborate legal procedure which used collaborative lawsuits and [[legal fiction]]s to "bar" a fee tail, that is to say to remove the restrictions of fee tail from land and to enable its conveyance in fee simple.  Biancalana's book ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176–1502'' (2001) discusses the procedure and its history at length.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Biancalana, ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176-1502'', Cambridge Studies in English Legal History, 2001.  520 pages. {{ISBN|0521032946}} (2007 reprint).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement==
In the 17th and 18th centuries the practice arose whereby when the son came of age (at 21), he and his father acting together could bar the existing fee tail, and could then re-settle the land in fee tail, again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, but at the same time making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father's widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father's lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.

==Formedon==
Formedon (or ''form down'' etc.) was a right of writ exercisable by a holder in fee for claiming property entailed by a lessee beyond the terms of his feoffment.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} A letter dated 1539 from the [[Lisle Letters]] describes the circumstances of its use:&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981, vol.5, letter 1359, p.408, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I received your ladyship's letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one estate in tail to him and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir [[William Coffin (courtier)|William Coffyn]] in his life. Howbeit Mr Richard Coffyn, next heir to Sir William Coffyn, claimeth the same by his uncle's feoffment to him and to his heirs so that the law will put Mr John Basset from his entry and to compel him to take his action of ''form down'' which is much dilatory as Mr Basset knoweth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Marquess of Hertford===
An English example of a fee tail may be the main estates of the wealthy art collector [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]] (d. 1870). His only child was his illegitimate son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet]], to whom he left as much of his property as he could. The main land holdings and [[Ragley Hall]] were inherited by his distant cousin, [[Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford]], descended from a younger son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|1st Marquess]] who had died in 1794. Most of the 4th Marquess's art collection had been acquired by himself or his father, went to Wallace, and is now the [[Wallace Collection]]. Other works were covered by the fee tail, however, and passed to the 5th Marquess.

===Earl of Pembroke===
Another example was [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]], who died in 1827. He had quarreled with his eldest son, later the [[Robert Herbert, 12th Earl of Pembroke|12th Earl]], and left his unentailed estate to [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea]], his son by a second marriage.

==Fees tail in fiction==
Fees tail figure in the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of several well known [[novel]]s and stories, particularly in the 19th century, including:

* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]]
* ''[[Middlemarch]]'' by [[George Eliot]]
* ''[[The Belton Estate]]'' (1866) and ''[[Ralph the Heir]]'' (1871) by [[Anthony Trollope]]
* ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]
* ''[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]
* ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]]
* ''[[Wideacre]]'' by [[Philippa Gregory]]
* ''[[The Quincunx]]'' by [[Charles Palliser]] (written in 1989, but it takes the form of a Dickensian mystery set in early-19th-century England)
* ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' by [[Julian Fellowes]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2015/04/The-Tale-of-the-Fee-Tail-in-Downton-Abbey.pdf The Tale of the Fee Tail in ''Downton Abbey'']", J. B. Ruhl, Vanderbilt Law Review, April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (written in 2009–2015, but set in England in the period 1912–1927)
* ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by Harper Lee (referred to as an "entailment")

===''Pride and Prejudice''===
''Pride and Prejudice'' contains a particularly thorny example of the kind of problems which could arise through the entailing of property. Mr. Bennet, the father of protagonist [[Elizabeth Bennet]], had only a life interest in the Longbourn estate, the family's home and principal source of income. He had no authority to dictate to whom it should pass upon his death, as it was strictly arranged to be inherited by the next male heir. Had Mr. Bennet fathered a son it would have passed to him, but since he did not it could not pass to any of his five daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Martin|title=Modern Land Law|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317821459|edition=Ninth|page=8 (footnote)|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ro78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the next nearest male heir would inherit the property—Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a boorish minister in his mid-twenties. The inheritance of the Longbourn property completely excluded the five Bennet daughters, who were thus to lose their home and income upon their father's death. The need for the daughters to make a good marriage to ensure their future security is a key motivation for many episodes in the novel. Many fees tail arose from wills, rather than from marriage settlements which usually made some provision for daughters. Austen was very familiar with the law of entail; her brother, Edward, had inherited similarly entailed estates at [[Chawton]], [[Godmersham]] and [[Winchester]] from distant cousins under the will of Elizabeth Knight, who died in 1737.&lt;ref name=grover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=Christine|title=Edward Knight’s Inheritance: The Chawton, Godmersham, and Winchester Estates|journal=Persuasions|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no1/grover.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Scotland===
{{main article|Tailzie}}
In [[Scotland]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] (section 50) abolished all feudal tenures including the entail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/50 ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act'' 2000, section 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the doctrines of ''[[legitime|legitim]]'' and ''[[jus relictae]]'' restrict owners from willing property out of their family when they die with children or have a surviving partner.

A Scottish example of fee tail is the case of [[Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton]], who in 1895 inherited from the 12th Duke, his fourth cousin, who had attempted to marry his daughter to the heir.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 abolished the fee tail in Ireland and converted existing fees tail to [[fee simple|fees simple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/sec0013.html#sec13 ''Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act'' 2009, section 13.]&lt;/ref&gt; For constitutional reasons, this section is subject to a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to fees simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, fees tail still exist in Ireland.

===United States===
The fee tail has been abolished in all but four states in the [[United States]]: [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]]. However, in the first three states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. [[New York (state)|New York]] abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a [[fee simple]]; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.

In [[Louisiana]], the common law concept of estates in land never existed.  The concept of forced heirship and the marital portion protects force heirs and surviving spouses from total divestment of value of the estate of the decedent, who has a duty to provide for their care.

Fee tail-like restrictions still exist though contractual obligations. For example, owners of [[inholdings]] inside public lands may be prevented from selling or gifting their land to non-family members. In this case, the restrictions result from an agreement between the government and the land owner, and is not a part of a deed or settlement.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and later in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], fee tail estates were called ''ordynacja'' ({{IPA-pl|ɔrdɨˈnatsja|lang}}; landed property in ''fideicommis''). ''Ordynacja'' was an economic institution for governing of landed property introduced in late 16th century by king [[Stefan Batory]]. ''Ordynacja'' was abolished by the [[agricultural reform]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. ''Ordynat'' was the [[title]] of the principal [[heir]] of ''ordynacja''.

According to the rules of ''ordynacja'', which became a statute approved by the [[Sejm]]&lt;!--when?--&gt;, the estate was not to be divided between the heirs but inherited in full by the eldest son ([[primogeniture]]).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;Peter Paul Bajer. "[http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm Short history of the Radziwill Family]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231031433/http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm |date=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from inheritance ([[Salic Law]]).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; ''Ordynacja'' could not be sold or [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

''Ordynacja'' was similar to the French law of ''[[majorat]]'' or German and Scandinavian ''fideicommis'',&lt;!-- Link to [[fee tail]] removed - not mentioned at that article --&gt; and succession to such resembles that of British [[peerages]].

Many Polish [[magnate]]s' fortunes were based on ''ordynacja'', among them those of the [[Radziwiłł]]s, [[Zamoyski]]s, [[Czartoryski]]s, [[Potocki]]s and [[Lubomirski]]s. Most important ''ordynacja'' were veritable little [[principalities]]. The earliest and most extensive ''ordynacjas'' include:
* [[Ordynacje Radziwiłłów]], created for [[Mikołaj VII Radziwiłł]], [[Albrecht Radziwiłł]] and [[Stanisław Radziwiłł]] in 1589, centered on [[Olyka]], [[Nesvizh]], and [[Kletsk]]
* [[Ordynacja Ostrogska]], created for [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1609, later inherited by the [[Zaslawski]], [[Lubomirski]] and [[Sanguszko]] families, centered on [[Ostroh]]
* [[Ordynacja Zamojska]], created for [[Jan Zamoyski]] in 1589, centered on [[Zamość]]
* [[Ordynacja Jarosławska]], created for [[Rafał Jarosławski]] in 1470, centered on [[Jarosław]]
* [[Ordynacja Pińczowska]], created for Piotr and Zygmunt [[Myszkowski]] in 1601, later inherited by the [[Wielopolski family]], centered on [[Pińczów]]

===Other===
Other European legal systems had comparable devices to keep estates together, especially in Spain and Northern European countries like [[Prussia]]. They are derived from ''[[fideicommissum]]'', a legal institution in [[Roman law]]. Unlike most of the English aristocracy, the [[Prussian Junkers|Prussian ''junkers'']] supported fees tail, and succeeded in reinstating them in 1853, after they had been abolished in a recent Constitution. In Germany and Austria the ''Familienfideikommiss'' was only abolished in 1938, and in [[Scandinavia]] they persisted even later – a few old Swedish fees tail still remain in force, though no new ones may be established. For the law of German and Austrian fideicommissa in particular, an 862-page manual by the German legal scholar [[Philipp Knipschildt]], entitled ''Tractatus de fideicommissis nobilium familiarum – von Stammgütern'' ({{Google books|V2tBAAAAcAAJ|De fideicommissis}}), was the standard reference work. First published in 1654, this grand systematization of existing legal opinion was frequently reprinted and continued to be consulted until well into the 19th century.

The '''Institute of Asian Research (IAR) Graduate Conference''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] is an annual graduate conference organized by the IAR Conference Committee, and co-hosted by the University's [[Institute of Asian Research]]. The symposium is a forum for interdisciplinary discussion on Asia Pacific policy-relevant issues, where students in all fields are encouraged to demonstrate the policy significance of their work. The IAR Conference Committee, under its collaboration with the College for Interdisciplinary Studies ([http://www.cfis.ubc.ca/ CFIS]) at UBC, publishes the proceedings of the conference in the ''Journal of the College for Interdisciplinary Studies'', as well as the possibility of publication in the Asia Pacific Memo.

== Mandate ==
The mandate of the symposium, as stated by its organizer (IAR Conference Committee), is "to promote academic awareness towards the salience of policy-relevant issues in the Asia Pacific and its surrounding regions. The IAR Conference Committee, backed by its belief of academic research as a necessary precursor to sound policy-making and the interdisciplinary nature of such, strives to create a community of understanding between students of Asia Pacific policy and makers of Asia Pacific policy by providing a dynamic forum for the exchange of ideas".[http://www.iar.ubc.ca/mapps/mappssaconference.aspx]

'''Ocean acidification''' threatens the [[Great Barrier Reef]] by reducing the viability and strength of [[coral reef]]s. The Great Barrier Reef, considered one of the [[Wonders of the World#Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]] and a [[biodiversity hotspot]], is located in Australia. Similar to other coral reefs, it is experiencing degradation due to ocean acidification. [[Ocean acidification]] results from a rise in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]], which is taken up by the ocean. This process can increase [[sea surface temperature]], decrease [[aragonite]], and lower the [[pH]] of the ocean.

Calcifying organisms are under risk, due to the resulting lack of aragonite in the water and the decreasing pH. This decreased health of coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, can result in reduced [[biodiversity]]. Organisms can become stressed due to ocean acidification and the disappearance of healthy coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, is a [[Habitat destruction|loss of habitat]] for several [[Taxon|taxa]].

Aragonite is impacted by the process of ocean acidification, because it is a form of calcium carbonate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is essential in coral viability and health, because it is found in coral skeletons and is more readily soluble than calcite.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Increasing carbon dioxide levels can reduce coral growth rates from 9 to 56%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other calcifying organisms, such as bivalves and gastropods, experience negative effects due to ocean acidification as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean acidification: Background and history|last=Gattuso|first=Jean-Pierre|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a biodiversity hotspot, the many taxa of the Great Barrier Reef are threatened by ocean acidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/great-barrier-reef/submissions/subdr077/subdr077attachment15a.pdf|title=Oceanographic Processes of Coral Reefs, Physical and Biological Links in the Great Barrier Reef|last=Fabricius|first=K.

== Coral health ==

=== Calcification and aragonite ===
Coral is a calcifying organism, putting it at high risk for decay and slow growth rates as ocean acidification increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aragonite, which impacts the ability of coral to take up CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, decreases when pH decreases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mongin|first=M|last2=Baird|first2=M. E.|date=2016|title=The exposure of the Great Barrier Reef to ocean acidification|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160223/ncomms10732/full/ncomms10732.html|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|issue=|pages=10732|doi=10.1038/ncomms10732|pmid=26907171|pmc=4766391|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of aragonite have decreased by 16% since industrialization, and could be lower in some portions of the Great Barrier Reef because the current allows northern corals to take up more aragonite than the southern corals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Aragonite is predicted to reduce by 0.1 by 2100.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since 1990, calcification rates of ''Porites'', a common large reef-building coral in the Great Barrier Reef, have decreased by 14.2% annually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aragonite levels across the Great Barrier Reef itself are not equal; due to currents and circulation, some portions of the Great Barrier Reef can have half as much aragonite as others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Levels of aragonite are also affected by calcification and production, which can vary from reef to reef.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 560 ppm, most ocean surface waters will be adversely undersaturated with respect to aragonite and the pH will have reduced by about 0.24 units – from almost 8.2 today to just over 7.9. At this point (sometime in the third quarter of this century at current rates of increase) only a few parts of the Pacific will have levels of aragonite saturation adequate for coral growth. Additionally, if atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 800 ppm, the ocean surface water pH decrease will be 0.4 units and total dissolved carbonate ion concentration will have decreased by at least 60%. At this point it is almost certain that all reefs of the world will be in erosional states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/landmark-experiment-confirms-ocean-acidification-s-toll-on-great-barrier-reef-1.19410|title=Landmark experiment confirms ocean acidification's toll on Great Barrier Reef|last=Tollefson|first=J|date=February 2016|journal=Nature|access-date=|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature ===
Ocean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature. An increase of about 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;°C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and [[zooxanthellae]], possibly leading to [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when [[Photosystem II]] is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Ocean acidification threatens coral reproduction throughout almost all aspects of the process.[[Gametogenesis]] may be indirectly affected by coral bleaching. Additionally, the stress that acidification puts on coral can potentially harm the viability of the sperm released. Larvae can also be affected by this process; metabolism and settlement cues could be altered, changing the size of population or viability of reproduction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other species of calcifying larvae have shown reduced growth rates under ocean acidification scenarios.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Biofilm]], a [[bioindicator]] for oceanic conditions, underwent reduced growth rate and altered composition in acidification, possibly affecting larval settlement on the biofilm itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witt|first=V|last2=Wild|first2=C|date=2011|title=Effects of ocean acidification on microbial community composition of, and oxygen fluxes through, biofilms from the Great Barrier Reef|url=|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=11|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02571.x|pmid=21906222|access-date=|via=|pages=2976–2989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
The Great Barrier Reef is a biodiversity hotspot, but it is threatened by ocean acidification and its resulting increased temperature and reduced levels of aragonite. [[Elasmobranchii|Elasmobranchs]] in the Great Barrier Reef are vulnerable to ocean acidification primarily due to their reliance on the habitat and ocean acidification's destruction of coral reefs. Rare and [[Endemism|endemic]] species, such as the [[porcupine ray]], are at high risk as well.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oceanographic Processes of Coral Reefs, Physical and Biological Links in the Great Barrier Reef|last=Fabricius|first=K. E.|last2=De'ath|first2=G|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=127–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larval health and settlement of both calcifying and non-calcifying organisms can be harmed by ocean acidification. A predator to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, the [[Crown-of-thorns starfish|Crown of Thorns sea star]], has experienced a similar death rate to the coral on which it feeds. Any increase in nutrients, possibly from river run-off, can positively affect the Crown of Thorns and lead to further destruction of the coral.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Coralline algae]] holds together some coral reefs and is present in multiple ecosystems. As ocean acidification intensifies, however, it will not respond well and could damage the viability and structural integrity of coral reefs. Ocean acidification can also indirectly affect any organism; increased stress can reduce photosynthesis and reproduction, or make organisms more vulnerable to disease. Additionally, as coral reefs decay, their symbiotic relationships and residents will have to adapt or find new habitats on which to rely.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Organisms have been found to be more sensitive to the effects of ocean acidification in early, larval or planktonic stages. As ocean acidification does not exist in a vacuum, the multiple problems facing the Great Barrier Reef combine to further stress the organisms. Not only can ocean acidification affect habitat and development, but it can also affect how organisms view predators and [[conspecifics]]. Studies on the effects of ocean acidification have not been performed on long enough time scales to see if organisms can adapt to these conditions. However, ocean acidification is predicted to occur at a rate that evolution cannot match.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Increasing temperature is also affecting the behavior and fitness of the common coral trout, a very important fish in sustaining the health of coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansen|first=J. L.|date=2014|title=Increasing ocean temperatures reduce activity patterns of a large commercially important coral reef fish|url=|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=20.4|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awards the '''John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation''' upon the recommendation of its Scientific and Technical Awards Committee. The medal is awarded with a citation reading "in appreciation for outstanding service and dedication in upholding the high standards of the Academy." The inaugural Medal of Commendation was given at the [[50th Academy Awards]], in April 1978, and is given irregularly.&lt;ref name='AMPASJBMedal'&gt;{{cite web|title=John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation|url=http://www.oscars.org/sci-tech-awards/john-bonner-medal-commendation|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences - John A.

==Naming==
The medal was originally called the '''Medal of Commendation''' but was named in 1997 for the American [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]] John A. Bonner who served for several years as the governor of the academy's Sound Branch; and as chair of its Scientific and Technical Awards Committee and its Theater Sound Inspection Committee.&lt;ref name='AMPASJBMedal'/&gt; Bonner had also been the director of special projects at [[Warner Bros.|Warner-Hollywood Studios]]. The president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], [[Arthur Hiller]] said that no person "...better represents the concept of service and dedication to the Academy" than Bonner and that he was "...dedicated to the Academy for more than 30 years. His devotion to the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater was legendary and his commitment to the Academy was simply extraordinary."&lt;ref name='AMPASJBMedal'/&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}

'''Lipstick feminism''' is a variety of [[third-wave feminism]] that seeks to embrace traditional concepts of femininity, including the [[Sexual attraction|sexual power]] of women, alongside feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Lankford, ''Women Singer-Songwriters in Rock'' (2010) p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike early feminist campaigns that focused on the basic fundamental [[rights of women]], starting with the [[Women's Suffrage]] Movement, lipstick feminism seeks to ascertain that women could still be feminist without ignoring or negating their femininity, particularly in terms of sexuality. During the [[second wave of feminism]], feminists had focused solely on legal and social equality of women and refused to 'embrace' their sexuality; some even abhorred the idea of men and would often take on physical characteristics and persona that was far from what the average woman looked like, thus creating stereotypes of what feminism and feminists looked like. Lipstick feminism, on the other hand, embraces the concepts of womanhood and the female sexuality emitted from a woman's body and the need to embrace sex. Lipstick feminism also seeks to reclaim certain derogatory words and turn them into powerful tools for their cause such as the word 'slut' as seen in the [[SlutWalk]] movement. It developed in part as a response to the [[Ideology|ideological]] backlash against radical varieties of [[second-wave feminism]], with the negative stereotypes it generated of the “ugly feminist” or the “anti-sex feminist”; in part the result of the belief that the successes of second-wave feminism had made it possible to reclaim aspects of femininity that had earlier been seen as disempowering, like make-up or stilettos.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Walters, ''Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism'' (2010) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==

Linguistically, lipstick feminism proposed to [[semantics|semantically]] reclaim, for feminist usage, double-standard insult words, such as “slut”,&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lipstick-feminism.htm What is Lipstick Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to eliminate the [[social stigma]] applied to a woman whose sexual behaviour was "[[Patriarchy|patriarchically]]" interpreted to denote “immoral woman” and [[libertine]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hollows/R. Mosely eds., ''Feminism in Popular Culture'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Philosophically, lipstick feminism proposes that a woman can be [[Power (philosophy)|empowered]] — psychologically, socially, politically – by the wearing of [[make up|cosmetic make up]], sensually-appealing clothes, and the embrace of sexual allure for her own self-image as a confidently sexual being. The rhetoric of choice and empowerment is used to validate such overt sexual practices,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, p. 28 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; because they no longer represent coerced acquiescence to societally established [[gender role]]s, such as “the good girl”, “the decent woman”, “the abnegated mother”, “the virtuous sister”, ''et aliæ''.

Other feminists object that the so-called empowerment of lipstick feminism is a philosophic contradiction wherein a woman chooses to sexually objectify herself, and so ceases to be her own woman, in control neither of her self nor of her person.&lt;ref name=wisegeek/&gt; In an ongoing debate, lipstick feminism counter-proposes that the practice of sexual allure is a form of social [[Power (sociology)|power]] in the [[interpersonal relations]] between a man and a woman, which may occur in the realms of cultural, social, and gender equality.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Stiletto feminism===
Stiletto feminism, a more ideologically radical variety of lipstick feminism, sees the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] use of [[fetish fashion]] as empowering;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruthpadel.com/uncategorized/helmut-newton-and-stiletto-feminism/ Helmut Newton and Stiletto Feminism]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends the argument from the acceptance of makeup, to the validity of women practicing occupations specifically predicated upon female [[Beauty|physical beauty]], such as working as a [[Striptease|striptease dancer]] or as a [[pole dancing|pole dancer]], as well as [[Exhibitionism|flashing]] or lesbian (girl-on-girl) exhibitionism.

== In popular culture ==
* In the U.S. television series, ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', the 57th episode, “[[Night Five]]”, features a scene wherein the characters debate the merits of lipstick feminism. The female protagonist decides it is empowering, while determining that sex-negativism distracts from important issues like pay equity and "honest-to-God sexual harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The West Wing Continuity Guide|title=#313 (57) "Night Five"

[[File:Mercury, Venus and the Moon Align.jpg|thumb|250px|Conjunction of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], appearing above the [[Moon]], at the [[Paranal Observatory]].]]

This is a list of our [[solar system]]'s recent and forthcoming '''planetary''' [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunctions]] (in layman's terms, "when two planets look close together").

In [[astronomy]], a conjunction is an event, defined only when using either an [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial]] or an [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]] [[celestial coordinate system]], in which '''any''' two [[astronomical objects]] (e.g. [[asteroid]]s, [[moon]]s, [[planet]]s, [[star]]s) have the same [[celestial longitude]], normally as when observed from the Earth ([[geocentric]]).

In the case of a geocentric conjunction of two of our solar system's planets, since our solar system's planets appear to travel "along the same line" (the [[ecliptic]]), the two planets appear to an Earthbound observer as being near one another in the sky around the time of the conjunction.

The list below presents instances during the period 2005-2020 in which two of our solar system's planets are in conjunction according to the equatorial coordinate system (in which the celestial longitude is termed [[right ascension]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9651">The '''Los Angeles School''' of Urbanism is an academic movement which emerged during the mid-1980s, loosely based at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Southern California]], which centers urban analysis on [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The first published identification of the Los Angeles (L.A.) School as such was by [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]] in his popular urban history of Los Angeles, ''[[City of Quartz]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mike | last=Davis| pages=84| year=1990 | publisher=Verso | isbn= 978-1-84467-568-5 | nopp=true | title= City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, the school emerged informally during the mid-1980s when an eclectic variety of [[neo-Marxist]] scholars began publishing a series of articles and books dealing exclusively with Los Angeles. During the school’s formation, Davis cautiously estimated that the school had about twenty members scattered throughout [[Southern California]] and beyond, with some members purportedly residing as far away as [[Frankfurt, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J (2002). "The Resistible Rise of the L.A. School" pp3-16 in Dear, Michael J. (ed.)''From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory''. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much of the work published by L.A. School members during the 1980s and early 1990s garnered considerable attention. However, while some members (e.g. [[Edward Soja]] and Mike Davis) became household names in urban theory, there was little consciousness of the school as its own entity, especially outside of Los Angeles. This changed in 1998, with the publication of an article by [[Michael J. Dear]] and Steven Flusty, which explicitly argued for the existence of a distinct L.A. School of Urbanism, of which its various theories, concepts, and empirical works could be pooled together to constitute a radical new conception of ‘postmodern urbanism.’&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J. and Flusty, Steven (2000). “Postmodern Urbanism.” ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers.'' '''90'''(1): 50-72&lt;/ref&gt; After Dear and Flusty’s publication, Dear popularized the school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=Soja| year=2010 | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn= 978-0-8166-6668-3| nopp=true | title= ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', pps.173-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the production of a series of articles and books, including a full-length edited volume comparing the L.A. School to the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J. (ed.); 2002; ''From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory''; Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; 
Though much of the work of the L.A. School is still widely read in urban studies, the school’s membership has declined substantially in recent years. At a retirement party for Soja in 2008 at which many purported  members were present, only Michael J. Dear appeared to be willing to envisage the school’s continued existence. This situation reflects the vital conceptual disagreements between members of the LA School, and especially between Dear and the other members.&lt;ref name="Halle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halle|first=David|author2=Beveridge, Andrew |title=Changing Cities and Directions: New York and Los Angeles|journal=On-Line Working Paper Series, California Center for Population Research, UC Los Angeles|date=12-01-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
There is no official list of present or historic members of the Los Angeles School of Urbanism. Some thinkers who are commonly considered members include:
*[[Michael Dear]]
*[[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]]
*[[Allen J Scott]]
*[[Edward Soja]]
*[[Michael Storper]]
*[[Jennifer Wolch]]

==Ideas==
The L.A. School has no official doctrine, and there is great diversity in the works of its various members. Nevertheless, there are several influences, themes, and concepts which are relatively consistent in the school’s scholarship. 
Perhaps the central characteristic of the thought of the L.A. School is a sustained focus on Los Angeles in both empirical and theoretical work, often with the underlying claim that L.A. is the paradigmatic American metropolis of the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name="Curry "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=James|author2=Kenney, Martin |title=The Paradigmatic City: Postindustrial Illusion and the Los Angeles School|journal=Antipode|year=1999| volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Monahan, Torin. | year = 2002 | title = Los Angeles Studies: The Emergence of a Specialty Field | journal = City &amp; Society | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–184 | url = http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/LA_Studies.pdf | format = pdf | doi=10.1525/city.2002.14.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than this, the L.A. School poses a challenge to, what many members see as, the dominant [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of Urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J and Dahmann, Nicolas (2008). “Urban Politics and the Los Angeles School of Urbanism.” ''Urban Affairs Review.'' '''44'''(2): 266-279&lt;/ref&gt; While the Chicago School presents a [[modernist]] theory of cities as based on social darwinist struggles for urban space, the Los Angeles School proposes a [[postmodern]] or [[postfordist]] vision. While not all members of the L.A. School identify as postmodernists, and in fact some (e.g. Mike Davis)&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Mike (1985). “Urban Renaissance and the Spirit of Postmodernism” New Left Review. I/151&lt;/ref&gt; are against the very concept, a focus on [[postmodernism]] is fundamental to many members of the L.A. School, who rely heavily upon theorists associated with postmodernism, such as [[Baudrillard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Frederic Jameson|Jameson]], and [[Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=Soja| year=1990 | publisher=Verso | isbn= 0-86091-936-6 | nopp=true | title= Postmodern Geographies: The Reassertion of Space in Critical Social Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael J. | last=Dear| year=2001 | publisher=Blackwell | isbn= 0-631-20988-3 | nopp=true | title= The Postmodern Urban Condition }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A further stream of work emerging from the LA School is represented by Scott and Storper's many publications on flexible specialization, agglomeration, and the economic dynamics of the contemporary metropolis. Scott and Storper's work differs from that of Dear and Soja by approaching urban theory from the perspective of [[postfordism]] rather than postmodernism. Scott and Storper represent one distinctive tendency in the LA School; Dear and Soja represent another.

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised against the Los Angeles School. Perhaps the most important of these is skepticism over the school’s actual importance relative to its claims. For instance, one criticism is that its literature sometimes deceptively excludes discussions or citations of other important works on urban issues, to give readers the impression that the L.A. school is more radical, original, and important than it actually is. In particular, some critics think that the contemporary importance of the Chicago School is grossly overstated by L.A. theorists, and that little to no attention is allocated to extremely important scholarly materials produced in the period between the decline of the Chicago School and the emergence of the L.A. School, particularly the work of Marxist urban theorists like [[Manuel Castells]], [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], and [[Henri Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, Mark.; Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The ‘LA School’ and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development’ pp157-181 in Eade, John and Mele, Christopher (eds.) (2008). ''Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The “LA School” and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development''. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar vein, much of the work of the L.A. School has been criticized for its incoherence and lack of a demonstrable methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Sui, Daniel Z (1999). Postmodern Urbanism Disrobed: or Why Postmodern Urbanism is a Dead End for Urban Geography. ''Urban Geography'' '''20'''(5): 403-411.&lt;/ref&gt;
A final criticism questions the L.A. School’s fundamental claim that Los Angeles should be considered the paradigmatic postmodern American city. This stems both from external comparisons which have been made between Los Angeles and other cities,&lt;ref&gt;Nijman, Jan (2000). The Paradigmatic City. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' '''90'''(1): 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Nicholas A (2010).“Lost in Dialectic: A Critical Introduction to Urban Space in Greater Hartford, 1633-2010.” Undergraduate Honors Thesis, Trinity College, CT. {{cite web |url=https://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/5D63F612-3C18-4A87-AAAB-1290D1FF0308/0/Bacon_Dialectic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143853/http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/5D63F612-3C18-4A87-AAAB-1290D1FF0308/0/Bacon_Dialectic.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }} pp.32-55.&lt;/ref&gt; and findings that in certain cases urban phenomena in Los Angeles do not match those of other American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jason | last=Hackworth| year=2006 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn= 978-0-8014-7303-6| nopp=true | title= ''The Neoliberal City'', p.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MusicWriter''' was founded in 1989 by music industry veterans [[Jon Monday]] and Larry Heller to develop and market NoteStation, a kiosk-based retail "point-of-sale manufacturing" system for the distribution and printing of [[sheet music]]. Besides having a very large library of songs across all music genres, the NoteStation was able to print the [[sheet music]] on demand in any key, as selected by the customer. This reduced the need for retailers to carry a large selection of physical inventory, which was usually only printed in one key.

Early in the MusicWriter's history [[Warner Bros.]] Music and [[Thorn EMI]], the two largest music publishers in the world, invested in the company and became board members. The company then was able to sign most of the major music publishers to offer their titles through the system.

MusicWriter was among the first applications of the new distribution paradigm of "Mass Customization" or "Point-of-Sale Manufacturing", where a retailer is able to offer a very large selection of a product, with virtually no inventory, and manufacture the customized product on the spot for a customer. This trend was documented in B. Joseph Pine II’s 1993 book, ''Mass Customization, The New Frontier in Business Competition'' published by Harvard Business School Press.

The company expanded its features to include producing [[MIDI]] files on demand and online ordering of music products from distributors.{{ref|Article1}}

The company was featured on CNN TV and written about in Fortune Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, and Popular Science.

Due to the major print music companies that fought against the technologies, in 1999 MusicWriter went bankrupt as online technology emerged and the decline of [[sheet music]] retailers made the in-store technology obsolete. However, years later online versions of the technology were introduced by other companies, such as SheetMusicDirect.com, MusicNotes.com, and SheetMusicPlus.com.

'''''N''-body units''' are a completely self-contained [[Systems of measurement|system of units]] used for [[N-body simulation]]s of self-gravitating systems in astrophysics. In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the total mass, ''M'', the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', and the [[Virial theorem#Virial radius|virial radius]], ''R'', are normalized. The underlying assumption is that the system of ''N'' objects (stars) satisfies the [[virial theorem]]. The consequence of standard N-body units is that the velocity dispersion of the system, ''v'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; and that the dynamical or crossing time, ''t'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle 2\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of standard N-body units was advocated by [[Michel Hénon]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hénon | first = Michel | authorlink = Michel Hénon

The '''National Institute of Oceanography (NIO)''', ({{lang-ur|{{nq|قومی اداره سمندر جغرافیہ}}}}), is a department of the [[Government of Pakistan]] and a major research institute of [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)]]. The NIO is a science and research executive organization located in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The NIO' research and studies are funded by the Federal Government of Pakistan while the facilities are provided by the [[Sindh Government]].

==History==
NIO was established in 1981 through a Government Resolution to conduct multidisciplinary research in [[oceanography]] in the coastal and offshore areas of Pakistan (EEZ 24,000&amp;nbsp;km²). The institute has 30 qualified marine scientists working on ocean biology/productivity, marine chemistry and environment, physical oceanography/coastal hydraulics, marine geology and geophysics.

'''Palomar Observatory''' is an astronomical [[observatory]] located in [[San Diego County, California]], United States, {{convert|145|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Los Angeles]], California, in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]].  It is owned and operated by the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) located in [[Pasadena, California]]. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University, [http://www.astro.cornell.edu Dept. of Astronomy]: [http://www.astro.cornell.edu/facilities/palomar.php  Palomar Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory operates several telescopes, including the 200-inch ({{convert|200|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Hale Telescope]] and the 48-inch ({{convert|48|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Samuel Oschin Telescope]].  In addition, other instruments and projects have been hosted at the observatory, such as the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the historic 18-inch ({{convert|18|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Schmidt telescope]], Palomar Observatory's first telescope, dating from 1936.

==History==

===Hale's vision for large telescopes and Palomar Observatory===

Astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]], whose vision created the Palomar Observatory, built the world's largest telescope four times. He published an article that was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that the American people would understand and support his project even though the country was in the depths of the Great Depression.

Hale followed this article with a letter to the International Education Board (later absorbed into the [[General Education Board]]) of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] dated April 16, 1928 in which he requested funding for this project. In his letter, Hale stated:

"No method of advancing science is so productive as the development of new and more powerful instruments and methods of research. A larger telescope would not only furnish the necessary gain in light space-penetration and photographic resolving power, but permit the application of ideas and devices derived chiefly from the recent fundamental advances in physics and chemistry."

===Hale Telescope===
{{Main|Hale telescope}}

The 200-inch telescope is named after astronomer and project manager [[George Hale]]. It was built by Caltech with a $6&amp;nbsp;million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, using a [[Pyrex]] blank manufactured by [[Corning Glass Works]] under the direction of George McCauley after several years of unsuccessful attempts by [[General Electric]] under Dr. A.L. Ellis. The first steps toward funding the construction of the 200 inch telescope were taken by Hale in 1928 and included a 23-ton glass block cast by [[José Antonio de Artigas Sanz]]. [[John August Anderson|Dr. J.A. Anderson]] was the initial project manager assigned in  the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TtcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Super Camera of the Skies."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1942, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope (the largest in the world at that time) saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] January 26, 1949 targeting [[NGC 2261]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://365daysofastronomy.org/2009/01/26/january-26-60th-anniversary-of-hale-telescope-first-light/  "60th Anniversary of Hale Telescope,"] ''[[365 Days of Astronomy]]'' (podcast). January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The American astronomer [[Edwin Powell Hubble]] was the first astronomer to use the telescope.

The 200-inch telescope was the largest telescope in the world from 1949 until 1975, when the Russian [[BTA-6]] telescope saw [[first light (astronomy)|first light]]. Astronomers using the Hale Telescope have discovered distant objects at the edges of the known universe called [[quasar]]s and have given us the first direct evidence of stars in distant galaxies. They have studied the structure and chemistry of intergalactic clouds, leading to an understanding of the synthesis of elements in the universe, and have discovered thousands of [[asteroid]]s. A one-tenth-scale engineering model of the telescope at Corning Community College in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], home of the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) was used to discover at least one minor planet, [[34419 Corning]].{{JPL|34419|†}}

===Architecture and design===
[[File:Palomar Observatory Dome - High Resolution.jpg|thumb|Hale Telescope Dome]]

According to the Observatory's Public Affairs Office, [[Russell W. Porter]] was primarily responsible for the [[Art Deco]] architecture of the Observatory's buildings, including the dome of the 200–inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Max Mason]] directed the construction and [[Theodore von Karman]] was involved in the engineering.

===Palomar Observatory and light pollution===

Much of the surrounding region of Southern California has adopted shielded lighting to reduce the [[light pollution]] that would potentially affect the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa International Dark-Sky Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101110647/http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa |date=2008-01-01 }} (IDA): [http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/is020.pdf  "Sky Glow Effect on Existing Large Telescopes"], IDA Info #20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescopes and instruments==
[[Image:P48 1994 Jean Large.jpg|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Jean Mueller]] posing with the [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] ]]

* The 200-inch [[Hale Telescope]] was first proposed in 1928 and has been operational since 1948. It was the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescope in the world]] for 45 years.&lt;ref name=HALE&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 200-inch Hale Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 60-inch reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building. It was dedicated in 1970 to take some of the load off of the Hale Telescope. This telescope was used to discover the first [[brown dwarf]] star.&lt;ref name=60IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 60-inch Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/60-inch.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 48-inch [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] was started in 1938 and installed in 1948. It was initially called the 48–inch Schmidt, and was dedicated to [[Samuel Oschin]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=SOT&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Samuel Oschin Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] was discovered using this instrument.&lt;ref name=SOTD&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Discoveries from Palomar Observatory’s 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html#science |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of Eris triggered the discussions in the international astronomy community that led to [[Pluto]] being re-classified as a [[dwarf planet]].

===Former instruments===

* An 18-inch [[Schmidt camera]] became the first operational telescope at the Palomar in 1936.  In the 1930s, [[Fritz Zwicky]], a Caltech astronomer, discovered over 100 [[supernovae]] in other galaxies with this telescope and gathered the first evidence for dark matter.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] was discovered with this instrument in 1993.  It has since been retired and is on display at the small museum/visitor center.&lt;ref name=18IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 18-inch Schmidt Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#p18 |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] was a multi-telescope instrument that permitted astronomers to make very high resolution measurements of the sizes and positions of objects in space. The shapes of some bright stars have been measured with the PTI.  It operated from 1995 to 2008.&lt;ref name=PTI&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#pti |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Palomar Planet Search Telescope (PPST), aka ''Sleuth,'' was a {{Convert|0.1|m|in|abbr=on}} robotic telescope that operated from 2003 until 2008.  It was dedicated to the search for planets around other stars using the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] method.  It operated in conjunction with telescopes at [[Lowell Observatory]] and in the [[Canary Islands]] as part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).&lt;ref name=PPST&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Sleuth: The Palomar Planet Finder |url=http://palomarskies.blogspot.de/2009/10/goodbye-to-sleuth.html |publisher=Palomar Skies |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The observatory has completed several [[astronomical survey]]s: the first in the 1950s, the second in the 1980s and 1990s, and a third in 2003.

===POSS-I===
The initial [[National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]] (POSS or POSS-I), sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6 [[degree (angle)|degree]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescope. The survey covered the sky from a [[declination]] of +90 degrees ([[Celestial pole|celestial north pole]]) to -27 degrees and all [[right ascension]]s and had a sensitivity to +22 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees [[declination]] was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.

Fritz Zwicky was the first astronomer to observe on Mt. Palomar and was the father of the Sky Survey Technique.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech did recognize Fritz Zwicky's sky survey pioneering work; however, The Big Picture project failed to recognize his contribution to the sky survey technique in the introductory panel at the Griffith Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) produced images which were based on the photographic data developed in the course of POSS-I.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS): [http://aps.umn.edu/ MAPS catalogue;] Mollise, Rod. (2006). {{Google books|Z0mvZk0s_TMC|''The Urban Astronomer's Guide: a Walking tour of the Cosmos for City Sky Watchers,'' p. 238.|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.B. Whiteoak, an Australian radio astronomer, used the same instrument to broaden this POSS-I data further.  Whiteoaks observations extended south to about -45 degrees [[declination]], using the same field centers as the corresponding northern declination zones. Unlike POSS-I, the [[Whiteoak extension]] consisted only of red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates.

===POSS-II===
{{Redirect|Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|POSS I|Palomar Sky Survey}}

The '''Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey''' ('''POSS II''', sometimes '''Second Palomar Sky Survey''') was performed in the 1980s and 1990s that made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was given an achromatic corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ), red (IIIaF) and near infrared (IVN) plates, respectively. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, [[J. Dave Mendenhall]], K. Rykoski, [[Jeffrey L. Phinney]] and [[Jean Mueller]] (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets during the course of POSS II and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then graduate student C. Wilson early in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516193335/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html |date=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the completion of the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), POSS II was the most extensive wide-field sky survey ever. When completed, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] will surpass ''POSS I'' and ''POSS II'' in depth, although the POSS covers almost 2.5 times more area on the sky.

POSS II also exists in digitized form (i.e., the photographic plates were scanned), both in photographic form as the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS)&lt;ref&gt;NASA/Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).: [http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/  &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ultimission &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rchive at &lt;u&gt;ST&lt;/u&gt;ScI (MAST)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=this appears to be an incomplete sentence|date=March 2012}}

===QUEST===
The multi-year POSS projects were followed by the Palomar [[Quasar Equatorial Survey Team]] (QUEST) Variability survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech press release: [http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12417.html "New Sky Survey Begins at Palomar Observatory."] July 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This survey yielded results that were used by several projects, including the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] project. Another program that used the QUEST results discovered [[90377 Sedna]] on 14 November 2003, and around 40 [[Kuiper belt]] objects. Other programs that share the camera are [[Shri Kulkarni]]'s search for [[Gamma ray burster|gamma-ray bursts]] (this takes advantage of the automated telescope's ability to react as soon as a burst is seen and take a series of snapshots of the fading burst), [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]]' search for [[supernova]]e to test whether the [[universe's expansion]] is accelerating or not, and [[S. George Djorgovski]]'s [[quasar]] search.

The camera for the Palomar QUEST Survey was a mosaic of 112 [[Charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) covering the whole (4 degree by 4 degree) field of view of the Schmidt telescope, the largest CCD mosaic used in an astronomical camera when built. This instrument was used to produce The Big Picture, the largest astronomical photograph ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ "The Big Picture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204102050/http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Big Picture is on display at [[Griffith Observatory]].

===Current research===
Current research programs on the 200-inch Hale Telescope cover the range of the observable universe including studies on near-Earth asteroids, outer solar system planets, Kuiper Belt Objects, star formation, exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;JPL: [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-090 "Planet-Hunting Method Succeeds at Last."] May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; gamma-ray bursts, black holes, quasars and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl Hale Telescope Observing Runs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212205940/http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope is actively working on a new sky survey, the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] (PTF).&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/ Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 60-inch telescope is used for a variety of projects including follow-up observations for the Palomar Transient Factory and is a rapid response telescope for [[gamma-ray bursts]].

===Clearest images===
In September 2007, a team of [[astronomer]]s from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] released some of the clearest pictures ever taken of [[outer space]].  The pictures were obtained through the use of a new hybrid "[[Lucky imaging]]" and "[[adaptive optics]]" system that sharpens pictures taken from the Palomar Observatory.  The resolution attained exceeds that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6975961.stm "'Clearest' images taken of space,"] BBC.

==Visiting==

The Palomar Observatory is an active research facility. However, parts of it are open to the public during the day. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the 200-inch telescope daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The observatory is open 7 days a week, year round, except for December 24 and 25 and during times of inclement weather. Guided tours of the 200-inch Hale Telescope dome and observing area are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October.  Details are available at the [http://palomar-observatory.org Observatory's web site].   There is a visitor's center and a gift shop on the grounds. Behind-the-scenes tours for the public are offered through the community support group, [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/friends.html Friends of Palomar Observatory].  Periodic tours are also organized by the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben H. Fleet Science Center: [http://www.rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html Palomar Observatory tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030411112150/http://rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html |date=2003-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The observatory is located off [[California State Route 76|State Route 76]] in northern [[San Diego County, California]], is two hours' drive from downtown [[San Diego]], and three hours' drive from central [[Los Angeles]] ( [[UCLA]], [[LAX]] airport ).  Those staying at nearby Palomar Campground can visit Palomar Observatory by hiking {{convert|2.2|mi|km}} up Observatory Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Observatory Trail in Cleveland National Forest | url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/observatory-trail-palomar-mountain/ | website=hikespeak.com | publisher=Hikespeak | accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the October 11 and 12, 1989, [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic strips, Calvin has a dream where Stupendous Man takes the lens from the Palomar Observatory telescope (though really the telescope has a mirror and not a lens) and uses it to destroy his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/search.php?phrase=stupendous+man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian band [[The Rheostatics]]' 1992 release ''[[Whale Music (album)|Whale Music]]'' features a track entitled "Palomar." The song depicts a man named Palomar on the top of a mount, cleaning his lenses with saline waters, and assembling his kaleidoscope in his lonely observatory.  The song presents a visual characterization of a man on a mountain and his relationship with his best friend, a dog.

In 1994, Palomar is mentioned in the first episode of season 2 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]". [[Fox Mulder]] refers to Hale's suggestion that an [[elf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Hale.html Biography of George Ellery Hale] at scienceworld.wolfram.com&lt;/ref&gt; crawled through his window and told him to build the observatory.

The band [[Wellwater Conspiracy]]'s 1997 debut album, ''[[Declaration of Conformity]]'', contains an instrumental track entitled "Palomar Observatory."  Wellwater Conspiracy singer/drummer [[Matt Cameron]] grew up in [[San Diego]] near the observatory.

'''Paul-Gilbert Langevin''' ([[Boulogne-Billancourt]], 5 July 1933 – [[Paris]], 4 July 1986) was a French musicologist, who wrote books on [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Franz Schubert]] and 19th-century classical music.

Paul-Gilbert Langevin was the son of French physicist [[Paul Langevin]] (1872–1946)&lt;ref name="Langevin1977p4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Anton Bruckner, apogée de la symphonie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUzi81BbBEC&amp;pg=PP4|year=1977|publisher=l'Âge d'Homme|page=4|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eliane Montel]] (1898–1992), a private teacher at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] science department. He started his scientific education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and then completed it at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie]], obtaining a degree in [[physical chemistry]] under the supervision of professor René Freymann&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03161964 ''The scientific life and work of René Freymann (1909–1995)''], on Springer website.&lt;/ref&gt;.

From a young age, Langevin had a deep interest in classical music, listening to [[Anton Bruckner]]'s symphonies on radio recordings during his youth and meeting conductor [[Roberto Benzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertobenzi.com/ Conductor Roberto Benzi], personal website.&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed his scientific degrees, he decided to write a thesis under the supervision of [[Daniel Charles]] at the ''Centre Universitaire de Vincennes'' about 19th century Austrian music, focusing on composer [[Anton Bruckner]] and the so-called "ethnoromantic" period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Musiciens d'Europe|url=http://ressources.ircam.fr/record/default:UNIMARC:28890|year=1986|publisher=La Revue Musicale|via=IRCAM website}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He became a physics teacher at the Sorbonne science department, and then, at the [[Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie]], which was created in the 1960s.  During this time, he met musicologists [[Harry Halbreich]], Gustave Kars, Jacques Feschotte, [[Pierre Vidal (composer)|Pierre Vidal]], [[Marc Vignal]] and [[Jean-Luc Caron]]. Langevin went on to create the Anton Bruckner French society,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cairn.info/revue-reliance-2007-2-page-140.htm ''Anton Bruckner, ce pauvre sot''], paper by Alfred and Françoise Brauner, on ''Cairn'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote books on 19th-century symphonic music, edited in ''La Revue Musicale'' and ''L'Age d'Homme'',&lt;ref name="Langevin1977p3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Anton Bruckner, apogée de la symphonie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUzi81BbBEC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1977|publisher=l'Âge d'Homme|page=3|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a music critic in ''Le Monde de la Musique'', edited by Anne Rey.

From the 1950s, Langevin focused on classical music, symphonic music, and writing. Specifically, he wrote articles, monographs and books about Anton Bruckner, [[Franz Schubert]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]], [[Albéric Magnard]], [[Joseph-Guy Ropartz]] and [[Charles Koechlin]]. He was also interested in works by [[Hugo Wolf]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodoni.ch/busoni/opere/LANGEVIN.html ''Ferruccio Busoni et son oeuvre symphonique''], paper by Paul-Gilbert Langevin, on ''rodoni.ch'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leoš Janáček]] and [[Carl Nielsen]].

He died on 4 July 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Peace education''' is the process of acquiring the ''values'', the ''knowledge'' and developing the ''attitudes, skills, and behaviors'' to live in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the natural environment.

There are numerous [[United Nations]] declarations on the importance of peace education.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''.

== Definition ==

Ian Harris and John Synott have described peace education as a series of "teaching encounters" that draw from people:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian and Synott, John. (2002) 'Peace Education for a New Century' ''Social Alternatives'' 21(1):3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*their desire for peace,
*nonviolent alternatives for managing conflict, and
*skills for critical analysis of structural arrangements that produce and legitimize [[social injustice|injustice]] and [[social inequality|inequality]].
[[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] suggests peace education be thought of as "encouraging a commitment to peace as a settled disposition and enhancing the confidence of the individual as an individual agent of peace; as informing the student on the consequences of war and social injustice; as informing the student on the value of peaceful and just social structures and working to uphold or develop such social structures; as encouraging the student to love the world and to imagine a peaceful future; and as caring for the student and encouraging the student to care for others".&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the theory or philosophy of peace education has been assumed and not articulated. [[Johan Galtung]] suggested in 1975 that no theory for peace education existed and that there was clearly an urgent need for [[peace and conflict studies|such theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan (1975) ''Essays in Peace Research, Volume 1''. Copenhagen: Eljers. pp. 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been attempts to establish such a theory. Joachim James Calleja has suggested  that a philosophical basis for peace education might be located in the [[categorical imperative|Kantian notion of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Calleja, Joachim James (1991) 'A Kantian Epistemology of Education and Peace: An Examination of Concepts and Values'. Unpublishd PhD Thesis. Bradford University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] has suggested that a rationale for peace education might be located in virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, conservative [[political ethics]], aesthetic ethics and the ethics of care.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early decades of the 20th century, "peace education" programs around the world have represented a spectrum of focal themes, including [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclearism]], international understanding, environmental responsibility, communication skills, [[nonviolence]], conflict resolution techniques, democracy, human rights awareness, tolerance of diversity, coexistence and [[gender equality]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Groff, L., and Smoker, P. (1996). Creating global-local cultures of peace. Peace and Conflict
Studies Journal, 3, (June); Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal
(Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-
Bass Publishers; Johnson, M.L. (1998). Trends in peace education. ERIC Digest. ED417123; Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. “Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being”. Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2011}} have also addressed spiritual dimensions of inner harmony, or synthesized a number of the foregoing issues into programs on world citizenship. While academic discourse on the subject has increasingly recognized the need for a broader, more holistic approach to peace education, a review of field-based projects reveals that three variations of peace education are most common: conflict resolution training, democracy education, and [[human rights education]]. New approaches are emerging and calling into question some of theoretical foundations of the models just mentioned. The most significant of these new approaches focuses on peace education as a process of worldview transformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Forms==

===Conflict resolution training===
Peace education programs centered on conflict resolution typically focus on the social-behavioural symptoms of conflict, training individuals to resolve inter-personal disputes through techniques of negotiation and (peer) mediation. Learning to manage anger, "fight fair" and improve communication through skills such as listening, turn-taking, identifying needs, and separating facts from emotions, constitute the main elements of these programs. Participants are also encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to brainstorm together on compromises&lt;ref&gt;See Deutsch, M. (1993). Educating for a peaceful world. American Psychologist, 48, 510-517; Hakvoort, I. and Oppenheimer, L. (1993). Children and adolescents' conceptions of peace, war, and strategies to attain peace: A Dutch case study. Journal of Peace Research, 30, 65-77; Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, approaches of this type aim to "alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S. (1999). Adolescents' beliefs about their conflict behaviour. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 208-230). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training ([[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]], [[Verbal Aikido]], [[Non-violent communication|NVC]]) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: "Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy education===
Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence
and war decreases. At the same time, "a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of [[critical thinking]], debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, [[toleration|tolerance]] of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], compromise and [[conscientious objection]]. Their aim is to produce "responsible citizens" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students "assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others":&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; skills that a multi-party democracy are
based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace.

===Human rights education===
Peace education programs centered on raising [[awareness]] of [[human rights]] typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education "faces continual elaboration, a significant theory-practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity".&lt;ref&gt;Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. "Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being". Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In one practitioner's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can increase the potential for conflict"''&lt;ref&gt;Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, D. (2002). Human rights education in diverse, developing nations: A case in point – South Africa. Issues of Democracy, 7 (March). Retrieved January 12, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldview transformation===
Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78.

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes an "Integrative Theory of Peace" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community.

===Critical peace education===
Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj &amp; Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas &amp; Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty &amp; Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2004). "Comment: what is peace education?" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty, R. &amp; Richmond, O. (2007). "Myth or Reality: Opposing Views on the Liberal Peace and Post-War Reconstruction,", Global Society 21: 491-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding, D. (2017). "Border Cosmopolitanism in Critical Peace Education,", Journal of Peace Education 14(2): 155-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2008). Encyclopedia of Peace Education. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2015). 'Pedagogies of Resistance' and critical peace education praxis. Journal of Peace Education 12(2): 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. &amp; Hantzopooulos, M. (Eds) (2016). Introduction: Theory, Research, and Praxis of Peace Education in Peace Education: International Perspectives. New York: Bloomsbury (1-16).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trifonas, P. P. &amp; Wright, B. (2013). "Introduction," in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Yogic peace education===
Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish &amp; Joyce 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Standish, K. &amp; Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; in concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilised to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society.

== Criticism ==
Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education "inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice". "Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2002). "The Nature of Peace Education: Not All Programs Are Created Equal" in G. Salomon and B. Nevo (eds.) Peace education: The concept, principles and practices in the world. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Quoted in Nelson, Linden L. (2000). "Peace Education from a Psychological Perspective: Contributions of the Peace and Education Working Group of the American Psychological Association Div. 48."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon (2002) raises the problem and its consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Imagine that medical practitioners would not distinguish between invasive surgery to remove malignant tumors and surgery to correct one's vision. Imagine also that while surgeries are practiced, no research and no evaluation of their differential effectiveness accompany them. The field would be considered neither very serious nor very trustworthy. Luckily enough, such a
state of affairs does not describe the field of medicine, but it comes pretty close to describing the field of peace education. First, too many profoundly different kinds of activities taking place in an exceedingly wide array of contexts are all lumped under the same category label of "peace education" as if they belong together. Second, for whatever reason, the field's scholarship in the form of theorizing, research and program evaluation badly lags behind practice… In the absence of clarity of what peace education really is, or how its different varieties relate to each other, it is unclear how experience with one variant of peace education in one region can usefully inform programs in another region."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Clarke-Habibi (2005), "A general or integrated theory of peace is needed: one that can holistically account for the intrapersonal, inter-personal, inter-group and international dynamics of peace, as well as its main principles and pre-requisites. An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke-Habibi, Sara. (2005) "Transforming Worldviews: The Case of Education for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Journal of Transformative Education, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 33-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21798">'''Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances''' (PBTs) are a class of compounds that have high resistance to degradation from [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic material|biotic]] factors, high mobility in the environment and high toxicity.  Because of these factors PBTs have been observed to have a high order of [[bioaccumulation]] and [[biomagnification]], very long retention times in various media, and widespread distribution across the globe.  Majority of PBTs in the environment are either created through industry or are unintentional byproducts.&lt;ref name="Blais"&gt;Blais J. 2005. Biogeochemistry of persistent bioaccumulative toxicants: processes affecting the transport of contaminants to remote areas. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 62: 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) were the focal point of the Stockholm Convention 2001 due to their persistence, ability to biomagnify and the threat posed to both human health and the environment.  The goal of the Stockholm Convention was to determine the classification of POPs, create measures to eliminate production/use of POPs, and establish proper disposal of the compounds in an environmentally friendly manner.&lt;ref name="Ridding"&gt;Ridding the world of POPs: A guide to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants". United Nations Environment Programme. April 2005. Retrieved 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the majority of the global community is actively involved with this program but a few still resist, most notably the U.S.  

Similar to POPs classification, the PBT classification of chemicals was developed in 1997 by the Great Lakes Binational Toxic Strategy (GLBNS).  Signed by both the U.S and Canada, the GLBNS classified PBTs in one of two categories, level I and level II.&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;USEPA. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement U.S Eighth Response to International Joint Commission.  Retrieved June 6, 2012 http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/glwqa/eigthresponse.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Level I PBTs are top priority which currently, as of 2005, contained 12 compounds or classes of compounds.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

The GLBNS is administered by the U.S [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) and  [[Environment Canada]].&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;  Following the GLBNS, the Multimedia Strategy for Priority Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic Pollutants (PBT Strategy) was drafted by the USEPA.&lt;ref name=USEPA /&gt; The PBT Strategy led to the implementation of PBT criteria in several regulational policies. Two main policies that were changed by the PBT strategy were the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which required more rigid chemical reporting and the New Chemical Program (NCP) under the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) which required screening for PBTs and PBT properties.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

==Compounds==

===General===
PBTs are a unique classification of chemicals that have and will continue to impact human health and the environment worldwide.  The three main attributes of a PBT (persistence, bioaccumulative and toxic) each have a huge role in the risk posed by these compounds.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;

===Persistence===
PBTs may have a high [[environmental mobility]] relative to other contaminants mainly due to their resistance to degradation (persistence).  This allows PBTs to travel far and wide in both the atmosphere and in aqueous environments.  The low degradation rates of PBTs allow these chemicals to be exposed to both biotic and abiotic factors while maintaining a relatively stable concentration.  Another factor that makes PBTs especially dangerous are the degradation products which are often relatively as toxic as the parent compound. These factors have resulted in global contamination most notable in remote areas such as the arctic and high elevation areas which are far from any source of PBTs.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Bioaccumulation and biomagnification===
The bioaccumulative ability of PBTs follows suit with the persistence attribute by the high resistance to degradation by biotic factors, especially with in organisms.  Bioaccumulation is the result of a toxic substance being taken up at a higher rate than being removed from an organism.  For PBTs this is caused mainly by a resistance to degradation, biotic and abiotic.  PBTs usually are highly insoluble in water which allows them to enter organisms at faster rates through fats and other nonpolar regions on an organism.  Bioaccumulation of a toxicant can lead to biomagnification through a [[trophic web]] which has resulted in massive concern in areas with especially low [[trophic diversity]].  Biomagnification results in higher trophic organisms accumulating more PBTs than those of lower trophic levels through consumption of the PBT contaminated lower trophic organisms.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of this class of compounds is high with very low concentrations of a PBT required to enact an effect on an organism compared to most other contaminants.  This high toxicity along with the persistence allows for the PBT to have detrimental effects in remote areas around the globe where there is not a local source of PBTs.  The bioaccumulation and magnification along with the high toxicity and persistence has the ability to destroy and/or irreparably damage trophic systems, especially the higher trophic levels, globally.  It is this reason that PBTs have become an area of focus in global politics.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Specific toxicants===

====PCBs====
Historically, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] were used extensively for industrial purposes such as [[coolant]]s, insulating fluids, and as a [[plasticizer]]. These contaminants enter the environment through both use and disposal. Due to extensive concern from the public, legal, and scientific sectors indicating that PCBs are likely [[carcinogen]]s and potential to adversely impact the environment, these compounds were banned in 1979 in the United States.&lt;ref name="USEPAA"&gt;USEPA. Basic Information on PCBs. Accessed June 1, 2012.   http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ban included the use of PCBs in uncontained sources, such as adhesives, [[fire retardant]] fabric treatments, and plasticizers in paints and cements.&lt;ref name="USEPAA" /&gt; Containers that are completely enclosed such as transformers and capacitors are exempt from the ban.&lt;ref name=USEPAA /&gt;

The inclusion of PCBs as a PBT may be contributed to their low water solubility, high stability, and semi-volatility facilitating their long range transport and accumulation in organisms.&lt;ref name="Ritter"&gt;Ritter L; Solomon KR, Forget J, Stemeroff M, O'Leary C.. "Persistent organic pollutants". United Nations Environment Programme. Retrieved 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The persistence of these compounds is due to the high resistance to oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination and electrophilic substitution.&lt;ref name="Amy"&gt;Amy Boate, Greg Deleersnyder, Jill Howarth, Anita Mirabelli, and Leanne Peck (2004). "Chemistry of PCBs". Retrieved 2007-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The toxicological interactions of PCBs are affected by the number and position of the chlorine atoms, without ortho substitution are referred as coplanar and all others as non-coplanar.&lt;ref name="Ritter" /&gt; Non-coplanar PCBs may cause neurotoxicity by interfering with intracellular signal transduction dependent on calcium.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon T, Britt JK, James RC (2007). "Development of a neurotoxic equivalence scheme of relative potency for assessing the risk of PCB mixtures". [[Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology]] 48(2): 148–70.

DOI:10.1006/taap.1999.8826. {{PMID|10631123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coplanar PCBs are similar to dioxins and furans, both bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms and may exert dioxin-like effects, in addition to the effects shared with non-coplanar PCBs.&lt;ref name="Safe"&gt;Safe, S. and Hutzinger, O. (1984). "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs): biochemistry, toxicology, and mechanism of action". Crit. Rev.

Effects of PBTs may include increase in disease, lesions in [[benthic]] feeders, spawning loss, change in age-structured populations of fish, and tissue contamination in fish and shellfish.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;Lehmann DW, Levine JF, Law JM. 2007. Polychlorinated Biphenyl Exposure Causes Gonadal Atrophy and Oxidative Stress in Corbicula fluminea Clams. Toxicol Pathol. 35:356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debruyn"&gt;Debruyn AMH, Meloche LM, Lowe CJ. 2009. Patterns of Bioaccumulation of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners in Marine Mussels. Environ. Sci. Technol. 43:3700–3704.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other organisms, which consume shellfish and/or fish contaminated with persistent bioaccumulative pollutants, have the potential to bioaccumulate these chemicals.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; This may put these organisms at risk of mutagenic, teratogenic, and/or carcinogenic effects.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; Correlations have been found between elevated exposure to PCB mixtures and alterations in liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and dermatological effects such as rashes have been reported.&lt;ref name="Ritter" /&gt;

====DDT====
One PBT of concern includes [[DDT]] (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an organochlorine that was widely used as an insecticide during World War II to protect soldiers from malaria carried by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; Due to the low cost and low toxicity to mammals, the widespread use of DDT for agricultural and commercial motives started around 1940. However, the overuse of DDT lead to insect tolerance to the chemical. It was also discovered that DDT had a high toxicity to fish. DDT was banned in the US by 1973 because of building evidence that DDT’s stable structure, high fat solubility, and low rate of metabolism, caused it to bioaccumulate in animals.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, Karl. 1997. DDT a Banned Insecticide. Molecules of the Month. http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/mom/ddt/ddt.html&lt;/ref&gt; While DDT is banned in the US, other countries such as China and Turkey still produce and use it quite regularly through [[Dicofol]], an insecticide that has DDT as an impurity.&lt;ref name="Turgut"&gt;Turgut, C., Cengiz, G., Cutright, T. 2009. Contents and sources of DDT impurities in dicofol formulations in Turkey. Environmental science and pollution research international. Volume 16. issue 2. page 214&lt;/ref&gt; This continued use in other parts of the world is still a global problem due to the mobility and persistence of DDT.

The initial contact from DDT is on vegetation and soil. From here, the DDT can travel many routes, for instance, when plants and vegetation are exposed to the chemical to protect from insects, the plants may absorb it. Then these plants may either be consumed by humans or other animals. These consumers ingest the chemical and begin metabolizing the toxicant, accumulating more through ingestion, and posing health risks to the organism, their offspring, and any predators. Alternatively the ingestion of the contaminated plant by insects may lead to tolerance by the organism. Another route is the chemical travelling through the soil and ending up in ground water and in human water supply.&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;Kan, A., Tomson, M. 2009. Ground Water Transport of Hydrophobic Organic Compounds in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in the case that the soil is near a moving water system, the chemical could end up in large freshwater systems or the ocean where fish are at high risk from the toxicological effects of DDT.&lt;ref name="Woodwell"&gt;Woodwell, G., Craig, P., Johnson H. 1971. DDT in the Biosphere: Where Does it Go? Science. Vol. 174 no. 4014 pp. 1101-1107.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the most common transport route is the evaporation of DDT into the atmosphere followed by condensation and eventually precipitation where it is released into environments anywhere on earth.&lt;ref name="Stewart Jr"&gt;Stewart Jr, C., Woodwell G., Craig, P., Johnson, H.1972. Atmospheric Circulation of DDT. Science. 724-725.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the long-range transport of DDT, the presence of this harmful toxicant will continue as long as it is still used anywhere and until the current contamination eventually degrades. Even after its complete discontinued use, it will still remain in the environment for many more years after because of DDT’s persistent attributes.&lt;ref name=Woodwell /&gt;

Previous studies have shown that DDT and other similar chemicals directly elicited a response and effect from excitable membranes.&lt;ref name="Vijverberg"&gt;Vijverberg, H., Van Den Bercken, J. 1990. Neurotoxicological Effects And The Mode of Action of Pyrethroid Insecticides. Informa Healthcare: Critical Reviews in Toxicology. Vol. 21, No. 2 , Pages 105-126.&lt;/ref&gt; DDT causes membranes such as sense organs and nerves endings to activate repetitively by slowing down the ability for the sodium channel to close and stop releasing sodium ions. The sodium ions are what polarize the opposing synapse after it has depolarized from firing.&lt;ref name="Vijverbergg"&gt;Vijverberg, H., Van der Zalm, J., Van den Bercken, J. 1982. Similar mode of action of pyrethroids and DDT on sodium channel gating in myelinated nerves. Nature. 295, 601 - 603.&lt;/ref&gt; This inhibition of closing the sodium ion channel can lead to a variety of problems including a dysfunctional nervous system, decreased motor abilities/function/control, reproductive impairment (egg-shell thinning in birds), and development deficiencies. Presently, DDT has been labeled as a possible human carcinogen based on animal liver tumor studies.&lt;ref&gt;''USEPA. 2012. DDT A Brief History and Status. United States Environmental Protection Agency. http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/chemicals/ddt-brief-history-status.htm''&lt;/ref&gt; DDT toxicity on humans have been associated with dizziness, tremors, irritability, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity has led to long term neurological and cognitive issues.&lt;ref name="WTC"&gt;Washington Toxics Coalition. 2002. PCBs and DDT. Washington Toxics Coalition.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mercury====

;Inorganic
Inorganic mercury (elemental mercury) is less bioavailable and less toxic than that of organic mercury but is still toxic nonetheless.  It is released into the environment through both natural sources as well as human activity, and it has the capability to travel long distances through the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Clarkson"&gt;Clarkson T., Magos L. 2006 The Toxicology of mercury and Its Chemical Compounds. Critical Reviews in Toxicology. 36:609-662.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 2,700 to 6,000 tons of elemental mercury are released via natural activity such as volcanoes and erosion.  Another 2,000 – 3,000 tons are released by human industrial activities such as coal combustion, metal smelting and cement production.&lt;ref name="Tchounwou"&gt;Tchounwou P., Ayensu W., Ninashvili W., Sutton D. 2003. Environmental Exposure to Mercury and Its Toxicopathologic Implications for Public Health. Environmental Toxicology 18:149-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its high volatility and atmospheric residence time of around 1 year, mercury has the ability to travel across continents before being deposited.  Inorganic mercury has a wide spectrum of toxicological effects that include damage to the respiratory, nervous, immune and excretory systems in humans.&lt;ref name=Clarkson /&gt;  Inorganic mercury also possesses the ability to bioaccumulate individuals and biomagnify through trophic systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Morel F., Kraepiel A., Amyot. 1998. The Chemical Cycle and Bioaccumulation of Mercury. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 29:543-566''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Organic
Organic mercury is significantly more detrimental to the environment than its inorganic form due to its widespread distribution as well as its higher mobility, general toxicity and rates of bioaccumulation than that of the inorganic form.  Environmental organic mercury is mainly created by the transformation of elemental (inorganic) mercury via anaerobic bacteria into methylated mercury (organic).&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson B., Cooper R. 2003. Comparison of Aerobic and Anaerobic Methylation of Mercuric Chloride by San Francisco Bay Sediments. Water Research 10:113-116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The global distribution of organic mercury is the result of general mobility of the compound, activation via bacteria and transportation from animal consumption.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;  Organic mercury shares a lot of the same effects as the inorganic form but it has a higher toxicity due to its higher mobility in the body, especially its ability to readily move across the blood brain barrier.&lt;ref name=Clarkson /&gt;

;Ecological Impact of Hg
The high toxicity of both forms of mercury (especially organic mercury) poses a threat to almost all organisms that comes in contact with it.  This is one of the reasons that there is such high attention to mercury in the environment but even more so than its toxicity is both its persistence and atmospheric retention times.  The ability of mercury to readily volatilize allows it to enter the atmosphere and travel far and wide.  Unlike most other PBTs that have atmospheric half-lives between 30 min and 7 days mercury has an atmospheric residence time of at least 1 year.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason R., Sheu G. 2002. Role of the Ocean in the Global Mercury Cycle. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 16:1093-1107.&lt;/ref&gt;  This atmospheric retention time along with mercury’s resistance to degradation factors such as electromagnetic radiation and oxidation, which are two of the main factors leading to degradation of many PBTs in the atmosphere, allows mercury from any source to be transported extensively.  This characteristic of mercury transportation globally along with its high toxicity is the reasoning behind its incorporation into the BNS list of PBTs.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;

==Notable PBT environmental impacts==

===Japan===
The realization of the adverse effects from environmental pollution were made public from several disasters that occurred globally. In 1965, it was recognized that extensive mercury pollution by the Chisso chemical factory in Minamata, Japan due to improper handling of industrial wastes resulted in significant effects to the humans and organisms exposed.&lt;ref name="Ministry"&gt;The Ministry of the Environment, (2002)."Minamata Disease: The History and Measures”. Retrieved January 17, 2007. http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury was released into the environment as methyl mercury (bioavailable state) into industrial wastewater and was then bioaccumulated by shellfish and fish in [[Minamata Bay]] and the [[Shiranui Sea]].&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt; When the contaminated seafood was consumed by the local populace it caused a neurological syndrome, coined [[Minamata disease]].&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt;  Symptoms include general muscle weakness, hearing damage, reduced field of vision, and ataxia.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt; The Minamata disaster contributed to the global realization of the potential dangers from environmental pollution and to the characterization of PBTs.

===Puget Sound===
Despite the ban on DDT 30 years earlier and years of various efforts to clean up [[Puget Sound]] from DDT and PCB’s, there is still a significant presence of both compounds which pose a constant threat to human health and the environment.&lt;ref name=WTC /&gt; [[Harbor seal]]s (''Phoca vitulina''), a common marine species in the Puget Sound area have been the focus of a few studies to monitor and examine the effects of DDT accumulation and magnification in aquatic wildlife. One study tagged and reexamined seal pups every 4 to 5 years to be tested for DDT concentrations.&lt;ref name="Calambokidis"&gt;Calambokidis, J., Jeffries, S., Ross, P., Ikonomou, M. 1999. Temporal Trends in Contaminants in Puget Sound Harbor Seal. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Publications. http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00964/&lt;/ref&gt; The trends showed the pups to be highly contaminated; this means their prey are also highly contaminated.&lt;ref name=Calambokidis /&gt; Due to DDT’s high lipid solubility, it also has the ability to accumulate in the local populace who consume seafood from the area. This also translates to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, since DDT will be transferred from the mother to child.&lt;ref name=WTC /&gt; Both animal and human health risk to DDT will continue to be an issue in Puget Sound especially because of the cultural significance of fish in this region.

A '''phase change material''' ('''PCM''') is a substance with a high [[heat of fusion]] which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as [[latent heat]] storage (LHS) units.

==Characteristics and classification==
Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid→solid, solid→liquid, solid→gas and liquid→gas phase changes. However, only solid→liquid and liquid→solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid→gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.

Initially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like [[sensible heat]] storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat.

** Change of volume is very high
** Super cooling is major problem in solid–liquid transition
** Nucleating agents are needed and they often become inoperative after repeated cycling[[File:InfiniteR Energy Sheet.png|alt=Infinite R Energy Sheet|thumb|Example eutectic salt hydrate PCM with nucleation &amp; gelling agents for long term thermal stability and thermoplastic foil macro-encapsulation physical durability.

=== Inorganic Eutectics ===
c-inorganic, inorganic-inorganic compounds
* Advantages
** Some inorganic eutectics have sharp melting point similar to pure substance.
** Volumetric storage density is slightly above organic compounds.
** Extra water principle can be used to avoid phase change degradation, involving dissolving the anhydrous salt during melting to result in a thickening of the liquid material so that it melts to a gel form; however, this can cause huge reduction in latent heat.
* Disadvantages
** They still have the same disadvantages as inorganic PCMs, such as reduced thermal performance upon cycling, corrosivity, high volume change, and high supercooling.
** Sharp crystals may form when the salt hydrate PCM solidifies, potentially causing leaks in cases of macro-encapsulation.
** Limited data is available on thermo-physical properties as the use of these materials is limited compared to organic PCMs.

=== Hygroscopic materials ===

Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:
*Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH&lt;0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat.
*Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH&gt;0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools).

Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2&amp;nbsp;°C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation, earth/clay render finishes,.

=== Solid-solid PCM materials ===

A specialised group of PCMs that undergo a solid/solid phase transition with the associated absorption and release of large amounts of heat. These materials change their crystalline structure from one lattice configuration to another at a fixed and well-defined temperature, and the transformation can involve latent heats comparable to the most effective solid/liquid PCMs. Such materials are useful because, unlike solid/liquid PCMs, they do not require nucleation to prevent supercooling. Additionally, because it is a solid/solid phase change, there is no visible change in the appearance of the PCM, and there are no problems associated with handling liquids, e.g. containment, potential leakage, etc. Currently the temperature range of solid-solid PCM solutions spans from -50&amp;nbsp;°C (-58&amp;nbsp;°F) up to +175&amp;nbsp;°C (347&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phasechange.com/products/phasestor/|title=Phase Change Energy Solutions PhaseStor|last=|first=|date=|website=Phase Change Energy Solutions|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==

Thermodynamic properties. The phase change material should possess:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.05.010|title=Phase change material-based building architecture for thermal management in residential and commercial establishments|year=2008|last1=Pasupathy|first1=A|last2=Velraj|first2=R|last3=Seeniraj|first3=R|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=12|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melting temperature in the desired [[operating temperature]] range
* High latent heat of fusion per unit volume
* High specific heat, high density and high thermal conductivity
* Small volume changes on phase transformation and small vapor pressure at operating temperatures to reduce the containment problem
* Congruent melting
* Kinetic properties
* High nucleation rate to avoid supercooling of the liquid phase
* High rate of crystal growth, so that the system can meet demands of heat recovery from the storage system
* Chemical properties
* Chemical stability
* Complete reversible freeze/melt cycle
* No degradation after a large number of freeze/melt cycle
* Non-corrosiveness, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive materials

==Technology, development and encapsulation==

The most commonly used PCMs are salt [[hydrate]]s&lt;!-- Only for housing applications? --&gt;, [[fatty acid]]s and [[ester]]s, and various [[Alkane|paraffin]]s (such as [[octadecane]]). Recently also [[ionic liquid]]s were investigated as novel PCMs.

As most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.

They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the [[thermal storage]] applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3650.html Frederik Tudor the Ice King] on ice transport during the 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; for rail&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Trevithick]]'s steam locomotive ran in 1804&lt;/ref&gt; and road applications&lt;ref&gt;[[Amédée Bollée]] created [[steam car]]s beginning at 1873&lt;/ref&gt; and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.

Unlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water [[chiller]] both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a [[cooling tower]] or dry cooler for charging the TES system.

The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide-ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection, i.e. cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.

Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2005.10.002|title=PCM thermal storage in buildings: A state of art|year=2007|last1=Tyagi|first1=Vineet Veer|last2=Buddhi|first2=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1146–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; naturally become the obvious storage choice.

*Encapsulation of PCMs
**Macro-encapsulation: Early development of macro-encapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor [[thermal conductivity]] of most PCMs. PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer.
**Micro-encapsulation: [[Micro-encapsulation]] on the other hand showed no such problem. It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials, such as [[concrete]], easily and economically. Micro-encapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system. By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating, the particles can be [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] within a continuous phase such as water. This system can be considered a '''phase change [[slurry]]''' ('''PCS''').
**Molecular-encapsulation is another technology, developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. It allows storage capacity up to 515&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/[[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] for a 5&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] board (103&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Molecular-encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.

As phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is [[hygroscopic]]). Packaging must also resist leakage and [[corrosion]]. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include [[stainless steel]], [[polypropylene]] and [[polyolefin]].

==Thermal composites==

Thermal-composites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper-mesh immersed in a paraffin-wax. The copper-mesh within parraffin-wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal-composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.

Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites. In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper-mesh) into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.

Solid composites such as fibre-glass or kevlar-pre-preg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined, but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions.
They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.

* Telecom shelters in tropical regions. They protect the high-value equipment in the shelter by keeping the indoor air temperature below the maximum permissible by absorbing heat generated by power-hungry equipment such as a [[Base Station Subsystem]]. In case of a power failure to conventional cooling systems, PCMs minimize use of [[diesel generator]]s, and this can translate into enormous savings across thousands of telecom sites in tropics.

==Fire and safety issues==
Some phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17856">[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|right|300px|thumb]]'''Presentational acting''' and the related '''representational acting''' are opposing ways of sustaining the '''actor–audience relationship'''. With presentational acting, the actor acknowledges the audience. With representational acting, the audience is studiously ignored and treated as voyeurs.

In the sense of '''actor-character relationship''', the type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the actor-audience relationship, is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in their actor-character methodology. Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' methodology.

==The actor–audience relationship==

In every theatrical performance the manner in which each individual [[actor]] treats the [[audience]] establishes, sustains or varies a particular kind of '''actor-audience relationship''' between them.

In some plays all of the actors may adopt the same attitude towards the audience (for example, the entire cast of a production of a [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhovian]] drama will usually ignore the audience until the curtain call); in other plays the performers create a range of different relationships towards the audience (for example, most [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] dramas have certain characters who frequently adopt a downstage 'platea' playing position that is in direct contact with the audience, while other characters behave as if unaware of the audience's presence).&lt;ref name="Weimann"&gt;Weimann, Robert. 1978. ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition in the Theater: Studies in the Social Dimension of Dramatic Form and Function.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-3506-2}} Pbk. See also Counsell, Colin. 1996. ''Signs of Performance: An Introduction to Twentieth-Century Theatre.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-10643-5}} Pbk. p.16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentational acting===
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:45em; max-width: 45%;" cellspacing="1"
| style="text-align: left;" |
Conventionalized '''presentational''' devices include the apologetic [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]], the [[Induction (play)|induction]] (much used by [[Ben Jonson]] and by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''), the [[Story within a story#Play within a play|play-within-the-play]], the [[aside]] directed to the audience, and other modes of direct address. These premeditated and 'composed' forms of actor-audience persuasion are in effect [[Metatheatre|''metadramatic'' and ''metatheatrical'']] functions, since they bring attention to bear on the fictional status of the characters, on the very theatrical transaction (in soliciting the audience's indulgence, for instance), and so on. They appear to be cases of [[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|'breaking frame']], since the actor is required to step out of his role and acknowledge the presence of the public, but in practice they are licensed means of ''confirming'' the frame by pointing out the pure facticity of the representation.
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | Keir Elam, ''The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama'', p.&amp;nbsp;90
|}
'Presentational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship that acknowledges the audience, whether directly by addressing them, or indirectly through a general attitude or specific use of language, looks, gestures or other [[Semiotics|signs]] that indicate that the character or actor is aware of the audience's presence.&lt;ref name="semiotics"/&gt; (Shakespeare's use of [[pun]]ning and [[Word play|wordplay]], for example, often has this function of indirect contact.)&lt;ref name="Weimann"/&gt;

===Representational acting===
'Representational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship in which the audience is studiously ignored and treated as 'peeping tom' voyeurs by an actor who remains in-character and absorbed in the dramatic action. The actor behaves as if a [[fourth wall]] was present, which maintains an absolute autonomy of the dramatic fiction from the reality of the theatre.

Robert Weimann argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each of these theatrical practices draws upon a different register of imaginary appeal and "[[Power (sociology)|puissance]]" and each serves a different purpose of playing. While the former derives its primary strength from the immediacy of the physical act of histrionic delivery, the latter is vitally connected with the imaginary product and effect of rendering absent meanings, ideas, and images of artificial persons' thoughts and actions. But the distinction is more than [[epistemology|epistemological]] and not simply a matter of [[poetics]]; rather it relates to the issue of function.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann (2000, 11).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The actor–character relationship==

The use of these critical terms (in an almost directly ''opposed'' sense from the critical mainstream usage detailed above) to describe two different forms of the '''actor–character relationship''' within an actor's methodology originates from the American actor and teacher [[Uta Hagen]]. She developed this use from a far more [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] formulation offered by the seminal Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] in chapter two of his acting manual ''An Actor's Work'' (1938).

===Stanislavski's typology===
[[File:Benoit Constant Coquelin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] considered the French actor [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin|Coquelin]] (1841-1909) to be one of the best examples of "an artist of the school of representation".&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski (1936, 21).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|Art of representation}}
In "When Acting is an Art", having watched his students' first attempts at a performance, Stanislavski's fictional persona Tortsov offers a series of critiques, during the course of which he defines different forms and approaches to acting.&lt;ref&gt;"When Acting is an Art" is the second chapter of ''[[An Actor Prepares]]'' (Stanislavski 1936, 12-30).&lt;/ref&gt; They are: 'forced acting', 'overacting', 'the exploitation of art', 'mechanical acting', '[[art of representation]]', and his own 'experiencing the role'. One common misrepresentation of Stanislavski is the frequent confusion of the first five of these categories with one another; Stanislavski, however, goes to some lengths to insist that 'two of them deserve to be evaluated as '[[art]]': his own approach of 'experiencing the role' and that of the 'art of representation'. He also makes the concession that so called "mechanical" can appear (when done well enough) to be almost the same as representation in the eyes of the audience, and is therefore occasionally artistic in quality.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Stanislavski's ''An Actor's Work'', for his conception of 'experiencing the role' see Carnicke (1998), especially chapter five.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' and 'representing the part' (which Stanislavski identifies with the French actor [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin|Coquelin]]) turns on the relationship that the actor establishes with their character during the performance. In Stanislavski's approach, by the time the actor reaches the stage, he or she no longer experiences a distinction between his or her self and the character; the actor has created a 'third being', or a combination of the actor's personality and the role (in Russian, Stanislavski calls this creation ''artisto-rol'').&lt;ref&gt;See Benedetti (1998, 9-11) and Carnicke (1998, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; In the art of representation approach, whilst on-stage the actor experiences the distinction between the two (the philosopher and dramatist [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] calls this psychological duality the actor's 'paradox').&lt;ref&gt;For Diderot's conception, see Roach (1985), especially the chapter on Stanislavski.&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches use 'living the role' or identifying with the character during rehearsals; Stanislavski's approach undertakes this process at all times onstage, while the 'art of representation' incorporates the results of the rehearsal process in a "finished" form.

==Confusion of terms==
Due to the same terms being applied to certain approaches to acting that contradict the broader theatrical definitions, however, the terms have come to acquire often overtly [[Contradiction|contradictory]] senses. In the most common sense (that which relates the specific dynamics of [[theatre]] to the broader [[aesthetic]] category of '[[Representation (arts)#History|representational art]]' or '[[Mimesis#Aristotle|mimesis]]' in [[drama]] and [[literature]]), the terms describe two contrasting functional relationships between [[Presentational acting and Representational acting#The actor–audience relationshp|the actor and the audience]] that a performance can create.&lt;ref name="semiotics"&gt;Elam , Keir. 1980. ''The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama''. New Accents Ser. Methuen. {{ISBN|0-416-72060-9}} Pbk. p.90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other (more specialized) sense, the terms describe two contrasting methodological relationships between [[Presentational acting and Representational acting#The actor–character relationship|the actor and his or her character]] in performance.&lt;ref name="stan&amp;uta"&gt;Stanislavski (1936, 12-32) and Hagen (1973, 11-13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision of these two senses can get quite confusing. The type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the first sense (of the actor-audience relationship) is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in the second sense (of their methodology). Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' in the second sense. While usual, these [[Chiastic structure|chiastic]] correspondences do not match up in all cases of theatrical performance.

Stanislavski's choice of the phrase '[[art of representation]]' to describe an artistic approach that diverges from his own has led to some confusion, given that the theatre that is often associated with his own 'experiencing the role' approach (realistic, not acknowledging the audience) is '[[Representation (arts)|representational]]' in the wider critical sense. Uta Hagen's decision to use 'presentational' as a synonym for Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' served to compound the confusion,&lt;ref name="Uta"&gt;Hagen (1973, 11-13).&lt;/ref&gt; part of the reason she preferred to refer to them more clearly as "formalistic acting" and "realistic acting".&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"&gt;Hagen, Uta 1991.  ''A Challenge for the Actor''. New York: Scribner's.  {{ISBN|0-684-19040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentational versus representational acting===

In their textbooks for actors, both Stanislavski and Hagen adhere to a mode of theatrical performance that starts with the subjective experience of the actor, who takes action under the circumstances of the character, and trusts that a form will follow. They deem it more useful for the actor to focus exclusively on the fictional, subjective reality of the character (via the actor's "emotional memory" or "transferences" from his own life), without concerning himself with the external realities of the theatre.  Both teachers were fully aware of the 'outside' to the dramatic fiction, but they believed that from the actor's perspective these considerations do not help the performance, and only lead to false, mechanical acting.&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski, Constantin 1936. ''An Actor Prepares''. New York, Theatre Arts, Inc. {{ISBN|0-87830-983-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many types of drama in the [[history of theatre]] do make use of the presentational 'outside' and its many possible interactions with the representational 'inside'—[[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare]], [[Restoration comedy]], and [[Epic theater|Brecht]], to name a few significant examples.  However, both Stanislavski and Hagen applied their processes of acting towards these types of drama as well, fully aware of their unique requirements to the audience.  Hagen stated that style is a label given to the "final product" by critics, scholars, and audience members, and that the "creator" (actor) need only explore the subjective content of the playwright's world.  She saw definitions of "style" as something tagged by others onto the result, having nothing to do with the actor's process.

Shakespearean drama assumed a natural, direct and often renewed ''contact'' with the audience on the part of the performer. '[[Fourth wall]]' performances foreclose the complex layerings of theatrical and dramatic realities that result from this contact and that are built into Shakespeare's [[dramaturgy]]. A good example is the line spoken by [[Cleopatra]] in act five of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1607), when she contemplates her humiliation in Rome at the hands of Octavius Caesar; she imagines mocking theatrical renditions of her own story: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore" (5.2.215-217). That this was to be spoken by a boy in a dress in a theatre is an integral part of its dramatic meaning.  Opponents of the Stanislavski/Hagen approach have argued that this complexity is unavailable to a purely 'naturalistic' treatment that recognizes no distinction between actor and character nor acknowledges the presence of the actual audience.&lt;ref&gt;It is worth qualifying this non-acknowledgment of the audience as of the ''actual'' audience, since Hagen recommends treating moments of direct audience address as if speaking to an audience ''within'' the fictional world of the drama (rather than one that observes that world ''from the outside''). See Hagen (1991, 203-210).&lt;/ref&gt; They may also argue that it is not only a matter of the interpretation of individual moments; the presentational dimension is a structural part of the meaning of the drama as a whole.&lt;ref name="shakespeare"&gt;The complexity of these dimensions of Shakespeare's dramaturgical strategies is outlined in Weimann (1965) and (2000); see also Counsell (1996, 16-23).&lt;/ref&gt; This structural dimension is most visible in Restoration comedy through its persistent use of the [[aside]], though there are many other [[metatheatre|meta-theatrical]] aspects in operation in these plays.

In Brecht, the interaction between the two dimensions—representational and presentational—forms a major part of his '[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]' dramaturgy and receives sophisticated theoretical elaboration through his conception of the relation between ''[[mimesis]]'' and ''[[Gestus]]''. How to play Brecht, in regard to presentational vs. representational has been a controversial subject of much critical and practical discussion.  Hagen's opinion (backed up by conversations with Brecht himself and the actress who was directed by him in the original production of ''[[Mother Courage]]'') was that, for the actor, Brecht always intended it to be about the character's subjective reality—including the direct audience addresses.  The very structure of the play was enough to accomplish his desired "alienation".&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"/&gt;

The adjectival form is '''pruinose''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|uː|ᵻ|n|oʊ|s|,_|-|z}}.

==Entomology==
In insects, a "bloom" caused by wax particles on top of an insect's [[cuticle]] that covers up the underlying coloration, giving a dusty or frosted appearance.  The pruinescence is commonly white to pale blue in color, but can also be gray, pink, purple, or red; these colors may be produced by [[Tyndall effect|Tyndall scattering]] of light.  When pale in color, pruinescence often strongly reflects [[ultraviolet]].&lt;ref name="corbet"/&gt;

Pruinescence is found in many species of [[Odonata]], particularly [[damselflies]] of the families [[Lestidae]] and [[Coenagrionidae]], where it occurs on the wings and body.  Among true [[dragonflies]] it is most common on male [[Libellulidae]] (skimmers).&lt;ref name="corbet"/&gt;

In the [[Common Whitetail]] and [[Blue Dasher]] dragonflies (''Plathemis lydia'' and ''Pachydiplax longipennis''), males display the pruinescence on the back of the abdomen to other males as a territorial threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Clifford | title = A Study of Territoriality and Breeding Behavior in Pachydiplax longipennis Burmeister (Odonata:Libellulidae) | journal = The Southwestern Naturalist | volume = 7 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 191–197 | year = 1962 | doi = 10.2307/3668841 | jstor = 3668841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Odonata may use pruinescence to recognize members of their own species or to cool their bodies by reflecting radiation away.&lt;ref name="corbet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Corbet | first = Phillip S. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Dragonflies: Behavior and Ecology of Odonata | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1999 | location = Ithaca, NY | isbn = 0-8014-2592-1 | pages = 281–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants, fungi, and lichens==
The term pruinosity is also applied for "blooms" on plants, for example on the skin of [[grape]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitis-vea.de/admin/volltext/w1%2008%20895.pdf ''‘Sangiovese’ and ‘Garganega’ are two key varieties of the Italian grapevine assortment evolution''], M. Crespan, A. Calò, S. Giannetto, A. Sparacio, P. Storchi and A. Costacurta, Vitis '''47''' (2), 97–104 (2008); p. 98-99 discusses different [[phenotype]]s of ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' '[[Catarratto]]' showing varying pruinosity&lt;/ref&gt; and also to powderings on the cap and stem of [[mushrooms]], which can be important for identification.

It may also be called a '''pruina''' (plural: pruinae), using the Latin word which gave rise to the various English terms.&lt;ref&gt;See [[wikt:pruina|Wiktionary entry]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPTCLGD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14261">'''Science by press conference''' (or '''science by press release''') is the practice by which scientists put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="techreview1989"&gt;Jerome F (1989). Science by press conference. ''[[Technology Review]]'' July 1989, No. 92, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disparagingly.&lt;ref name="hall2004"&gt;Hall, Stephen S. (2004). ''Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|978-0-618-49221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to associate the target with people promoting scientific "findings" of questionable scientific merit who turn to the media for attention when they are unlikely to win the approval of the professional scientific community.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to [[independent review]] with a "thorough examination by the scientific community" before they are widely publicized.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; The standard practice is to publish a paper in a [[peer-review]]ed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-[[attention seeking]] way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== History of the term ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at [[Stanford University Medical School]], in a 1980 letter which appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="Andreopoulos1980"&gt;Andreopoulos Spyros  (March 27, 1980). Gene Cloning by Press Conference. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 1980; 302:743–746&lt;/ref&gt; Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of [[biotechnology]] startups, including [[Biogen]] and [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=Merchants of immortality: chasing the dream of human life extension |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-49221-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]] which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.&lt;ref name="angell1991"&gt;Angell, Marcia and Kassirer, Jerome P.

=== Notable examples of science by press conference ===

* In 1989, chemists [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved [[cold fusion]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilford1989"&gt;Wilford, John Noble (April 24, 1989).

* In September 2012, [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]] held a press conference to claim that [[genetically modified food]] caused terrible cancers in rats, on the eve of the publication of a scientific paper, a book publication, and a movie release, and in the runup to the vote on the GM food labeling initiative, [[California Proposition 37]].  As the [[Séralini affair]] unfolded, it was revealed that Séralini required journalists to sign [[confidentiality agreements]] in order to receive pre-prints of the paper, to prevent them from discussing the paper with independent scientists.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/490158a |title=Hyped GM maize study faces growing scrutiny |year=2012 |last1=Butler |first1=Declan |journal=Nature |volume=490 |issue=7419 |pages=158 |pmid=23060167|bibcode = 2012Natur.490..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientific paper was retracted in 2013.&lt;ref name=Elsevier2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Announces Article Retraction from Journal Food and Chemical Toxicology|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases became notorious examples of "science by press conference" precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later either rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==
[[File:201609 KDGS nr28.jpg|thumb|Martina Franzen on a German congress of sociology, 2016]]
Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences.&lt;ref name=Winsten&gt;{{cite journal |author=J A Winsten |title=Science and the media: the boundaries of truth |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |year=1985 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.4.1.5 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/5.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to "avoid losing credit" for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market like opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. [[Biotechnology]] companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name="angell1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

In recent years, sociologists of science have recast discussion about "science by press conference". They point to the increasing presence of media conversation across all aspects of culture, and argue that science is subject to many of the same social forces as other aspects of culture. They have described the increased "medialization" of science, and suggest that both science and society are changed by this process.&lt;ref name="Rödder"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Simone |editor1-last=Rödder |editor2-first=Martina |editor2-last=Franzen |editor3-first=Peter |editor3-last=Weingart |title=The sciences' media connection : public communication and its repercussions |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht/New York |isbn=9789400720848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation; the fact that they often do not can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

A common example of science by press conference occurs when the media report that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, like [[HIV]] treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of [[AIDS]] [[activism]] in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists' ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase "science by press conference". [[AIDS denialist]] groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and [[AIDS]] research, particularly [[Robert Gallo]]'s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalichman, Seth C. |title=Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-387-79475-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Science+by+press+conference%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Science%20by%20press%20conference%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |doi= |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the [[SARS]] outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons.

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase "science by press conference".&lt;ref name="pmid18165635"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox RA, Djulbegovic B, Moffitt HL, Guyatt GH, Montori VM |title=Randomized trials in oncology stopped early for benefit |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=18–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18165635 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6259 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term "science by press conference" does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.

The '''Scottish government economy directorates''' were a set of [[:wikt:directorate|directorates]] within the [[Scottish government]], the executive arm of the devolved government of [[Scotland]].  The directorates were headed by Dr [[Andrew Goudie (economist)|Andrew Goudie]], who also acted as the chief economic adviser to the Scottish government (Goudie retired in 2011 and joined [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14268157|title=Andrew Goudie to take up Strathclyde University role|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The directorates were responsible for transport, sustainable development and planning. In 2010, the transport directorate merged with [[Transport Scotland]], an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]] and accountable to [[Scottish Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2010/fa_0910_transport_scotland.pdf|title=Report on the 2009/10 audit to Transport Scotland and the Auditor General for Scotland |last=|first=|date=November 2010|website=Audit Scotland|publisher=Transport Scotland|access-date=18 May  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">'''Stable-isotope probing''' ('''SIP''') is a technique in [[microbial ecology]] for tracing fluxes of [[nutrient]]s in [[biogeochemical cycling]] by microorganisms. A substrate is enriched with a heavier [[stable isotope]] that is consumed by the organisms to be studied. [[Biomarkers]] with the heavier isotope incorporated into them can be separated from biomarkers containing the more naturally abundant lighter isotope by [[isopycnic centrifugation]]. For example, [[isotopes of carbon|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]][[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be used to find out which organisms are actively [[photosynthesizing]] or consuming new photosynthate. As the biomarker, [[DNA]] with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is then separated from DNA with &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C by centrifugation. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] the DNA identifies which organisms were consuming existing [[carbohydrates]] and which were using carbohydrates more recently produced from photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=radajeweksi&gt;{{cite journal |last= Radajewski|first= Stefan|last2= Ineson|first2= Philip|last4= Murrell|first4= Colin|last3= Parekh|first3= Nisha R.|date= 2000|title= Stable-isotope probing as a tool in microbial ecology|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6770/abs/403646a0.html|journal= Nature|publisher= |volume= 403|issue= 6770|pages= 646–649|doi= 10.1038/35001054|accessdate=29 May 2014|pmid=10688198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When DNA is the biomarker, SIP theoretically can be performed using isotopically labeled C, H, O or N, though &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is used most often.  Cupples et al. (2007) demonstrated a weaker DNA buoyant density shift in when &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N- versus &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled substrates were used in pure culture, conversely a very strong buoyant density shift was observed when both labels were used.&lt;ref&gt;Cupples, A.M., E.A.

A '''trojan wave packet''' is a [[wave packet]] that is nonstationary and nonspreading. It is part of an artificially created system that consists of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more electron wave packets, and that is highly excited under a continuous electromagnetic field.

The strong, polarized [[electromagnetic field]], holds or "traps" each electron wave packet in an intentionally selected orbit (energy shell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cft.edu.pl/~birula/publ/RadTroj.pdf|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.56.3623|title=Radiative decay of Trojan wave packets|date=1997|author=Bialynicka-Birula, Zofia|journal=Physical Review A|volume=56|pages=3623|last2=Bialynicki-Birula|first2=Iwo|bibcode = 1997PhRvA..56.3623B|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.53.1715|title=Trojan wave packets: Mathieu theory and generation from circular states|date=1996|author=Kalinski, Maciej|journal=Physical Review A|volume=53|pages=1715–1724|pmid=9913064|last2=Eberly|first2=JH|issue=3 |bibcode = 1996PhRvA..53.1715K }}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive their names from the [[Trojan (astronomy)|trojan asteroid]]s in the Sun–Jupiter system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kochański |first=Piotr |last2=Bialynicka-Birula |first2=Zofia |last3=Bialynicki-Birula |first3=Iwo |date=2000 |title=Squeezing of electromagnetic field in a cavity by electrons in Trojan states |journal= Physical Review A|volume= 63|issue= |page=1 |url= |id= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |arxiv=quant-ph/0007033v1|bibcode = 2001PhRvA..63a3811K |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.63.013811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trojan asteroids orbit around the Sun in [[Jupiter]]'s orbit at its [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian equilibrium point]]s L4 and L5, where they are phase-locked and protected from collision with each other, and this phenomenon is analogous to the way the wave packet is held together.

==Concepts and research==
The concept of the Trojan wave packet is derived from a flourishing area of physics which manipulates atoms and ions at the atomic level creating [[ion traps]]. Ion traps allow the manipulation of atoms and are used to create new states of matter including [[ionic liquid]]s, [[Wigner crystal]]s and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This ability to manipulate the quantum properties directly is key to the real life development of applicable [[Nanotechnology|nanodevices]] such as [[quantum dots]] and microchip traps. In 2004 it was shown that it is   possible to create a trap which is actually a single atom.  Within the atom, the behavior of an electron can be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During experiments in 2004 using lithium atoms in an excited state, researchers were able to localize an electron in a classical orbit for 15,000 orbits (900 ns). It was neither spreading nor dispersing. This "classical atom" was synthesized by "tethering" the electron using a microwave field to which its motion is phase locked. The phase lock of the electrons in this unique atomic system is, as mentioned above, analogous to the phase locked asteroids of Jupiter's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maeda | first =  H.|author2=D.

The techniques explored in this experiment are a solution to a problem that dates back to 1926. Physicists at that time realized that any initially localized wave packet will inevitably spread around the orbit of the electrons. Physicist noticed that "the wave equation is dispersive for the atomic Coulomb potential." In the 1980s several groups of researchers proved this to be true. The wave packets spread all the way around the orbits and coherently interfered with themselves. Recently the real world innovation realized with experiments such as Trojan wave packets, is localizing the wave packets, i.e., with no dispersion. Applying a  polarized circular EM field, at microwave frequencies, synchronized with an electron wave packet, intentionally keeps the electron wave packets in a Lagrange type orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Stroud | first = C.

The Trojan wave packet  experiments built on previous work with lithium atoms in an excited state. These are atoms, which respond sensitively to electric and magnetic fields, have decay periods that are relatively prolonged, and electrons, which for all intents and purposes actually operate in classical orbits. The sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields is important because this allows control and response  by the polarized microwave field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunysb.edu/metcalf/rydbergprint.htm |title=Rydberg Atom Optics |accessdate=2008-07-30 |author=Metcalf Research Group |date=2004-11-08 |publisher=Stoney Brook University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050826121501/http://www.sunysb.edu/metcalf/rydbergprint.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beyond single electron wave packets===

[[Image:Wave packet (dispersion).gif|right|thumb|200px|In physics, a '''[[wave packet]]''' is a short "burst" or "envelope" of wave action that travels as a unit.  A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, an infinite set of component [[sinusoidal wave]]s of different [[wavenumber]]s, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;

The next logical step is to attempt to move from single electron wave packets to more than one electron [[wave packet]]. This had already been accomplished in [[barium]] atoms, with two electron wave packets. These two were localized. However, eventually, these created [[Dispersion (materials science)|dispersion]] after colliding near the nucleus. Another technique employed a nondispersive pair of electrons, but one of these had to have a localized orbit close to the nucleus. The nondispersive two-electron Trojan wave packets demonstration changes all that. These are the next step analogue of the one electron
Trojan wave packets - and designed for excited helium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.2356|title=Localization in Artificial Disorder: Two Coupled Quantum Dots|date=2000|author=Brodsky, M.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|pages=2356–9|pmid=10978009|last2=Zhitenev|first2=NB|last3=Ashoori|first3=RC|last4=Pfeiffer|first4=LN|last5=West|first5=KW|issue=11|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.2356B|arxiv = cond-mat/0001455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.161|title=Observation of Quantum Fluctuations of Charge on a Quantum Dot|date=1999|author=Berman, D.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=82|pages=161|last2=Zhitenev|first2=N.|last3=Ashoori|first3=R.|last4=Shayegan|first4=M.|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..161B|arxiv = cond-mat/9803373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2005, atoms with coherent, stable two-electron, nondispersing wave packets had been created. These are excited helium-like atoms, or  [[quantum dot]] helium (in [[Solid-state physics|solid-state]] applications), and are atomic (quantum) analogues to the [[three body problem]] of Newton's [[classical physics]], which includes today's [[astrophysics]]. In tandem, circularly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] electromagnetic and magnetic fields stabilize the two electron configuration in the [[helium atom]] or the quantum dot helium (with impurity center). The stability is maintained over a broad [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and because of this, the configuration of two electron wave packets is considered to be truly nondispersive.  For example, with the quantum dot helium, configured for confining electrons in two spatial dimensions, there now exists a variety of trojan wave packet configurations with two electrons
, and as of 2005, only one in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.103001|title=Nondispersive Two-Electron Wave Packets in a Helium Atom|date=2005|author=Kalinski, Matt|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=95|pages=103001|pmid=16196925|last2=Hansen|first2=Loren|last3=David|first3=Farrelly|issue=10|bibcode=2005PhRvL..95j3001K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 an  essential experimental step  was undertaken not only generating but locking the Trojan wavepackets on adiabatically changed frequency and expanding the atoms as once predicted by Kalinski and [[Joseph H.

The '''Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala''' ('''USAC''', ''University of San Carlos of Guatemala'') is the biggest and oldest university of Guatemala; it is also the fourth founded in [[the Americas]]. Established in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]] during the Spanish colony, it was the most prestigious institution of higher education in [[Central America]] — and the only one in Guatemala until 1954.&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;In 1954 a coup led by the National Liberation Movement which was sponsored by the [[United Fruit Company]] and coordinated by [[CIA]] and [[State Department]] American operatives who had links with the US company triumphed .&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has had five major transformations:
* '''Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1676–1829): Established during the colony by the Spanish Crown in the 17th century, approved by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and directed by [[regular clergy|regular orders]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. After the [[Act of Independence of Central America|Independence in 1821]], it was called only Pontifical University.
* '''Academia de Ciencias''' ('''Academy of Science''') (1834–1840): a secular institution created during the [[Central American Federation]] by the liberal governor [[Mariano Galvez]].
* '''Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1840–1875): an ecclesiastical institution run by the [[regular clergy|regular orders]] during the governments of [[Rafael Carrera]] and [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854]].
* '''National University of Guatemala''' (1875–1944): a secular and [[positivism|positivist]] institution divided into colleges of Notary and Law, Medicine and Pharmacy.
* '''University of San Carlos of Guatemala''' (1944-): a socially oriented secular institution established after the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of 1944]].

The University grew out of the Colegio de Santo Tomás de Aquino (Saint Thomas Aquinas High School), founded in 1562 by Bishop [[Francisco Marroquín]].&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt; After a series of [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquakes in 1773]], which destroyed many parts of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, the crown authorities ordered the evacuation of the city and the relocation of its government, religious and university functions to the new capital [[Guatemala City|La Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción]], the  university's present location.&lt;ref name=paganini&gt;{{harvnb|Paganini|1947|pp=49–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, from the 16th to 19th centuries, it offered studies in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[liturgical]] law, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]].

However, their activities were interrupted after the Independence of [[Central America]] in 1821. At that time, each province of the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] promoted the creation of a local university. The university remained as an institution in Guatemala, but it closed in 1829, after the conservative [[criollo people|criollos]] were expelled from Central America, and in 1834 converted into the "Academy of Sciences". In 1840, with the comeback of the conservatives, it was turned into the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" once again and even for a short period between 1918 and 1920, it was called "Estrada Cabrera University" in honor of the then president, lawyer [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]. After the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of October 1944]], the USAC managed to obtain total autonomy, but from 1954, with the resurgence of Catholic education and the establishment of private universities, an attrition process of the university began, which included constant nonpayment of the budget percentage that corresponds to the University by the Constitution and the persecution and assassination of student leaders and faculty members throughout the duration of the [[Guatemala Civil War]] (1960–1996).

==History==
===First era: Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ===
[[File:Carlo Borromeo.jpg|200px|thumb|Saint [[Charles Borromeo|Carlo Borromeo]], by [[Giovanni Ambrogio Figino]]. Oil on canvas, 41 × 48 cm. [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]]. The University of San Carlos was established under his protection on 31 January 1676.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
The university tradition in Guatemala and Central America goes back to the 17th century, when the University of San Carlos was founded on 31 January 1676 by Royal Decree of [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] in the colonial capital of [[Antigua, Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]]. The Royal University of San Carlos became the third Royal College founded in Spanish America and it was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent XI]] on June 18, 1687.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

[[File:1a. Universidad.JPG|thumb|200px|Section of the memorial to the first University in the city of [[Antigua Guatemala]]&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
Colonization by the Spaniards implied a new formation of society, with its brand new civil and ecclesiastical institutions. As time went by, residents demanded a place in the royal institutions for their descendants, in return for the heroics of their ancestors during the battles of conquest. However, there were no schools to teach youth to become public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavón Romero|first=Armando|title=Universitarios en la Nueva España|publisher=CESU-UNAM |location=México|year=2003|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the second half of the 16th century that the first initiatives to found schools that covered more than religious indoctrination and reading and writing took place. The first bishop of Guatemala, [[Francisco Marroquín]], requested the approval of the Spanish crown to set up a grammar class, in which Latin was to be taught, as it was the intellectual language of the time. This single fact has been the basis to perpetuate the myth that links bishop Marroquin to the early stages of the University of San Carlos.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Among those historians that have perpetuated the myth is Juan Rodríguez Cabal, who presented a letter that Marroquín sent to Spain in 1548 requesting the establishment of a university. Rodríguez Cabal's investigations were published for the first time in the 1950s, and as part of the third centennial of the foundation of the University of San Carlos in 1976, the University of San Carlos press made several more copies.&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;}}

Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in his will some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where  Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The beneficiaries of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already read a lot of things that are not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..."{{sfn|Tate Lanning|1977|p=8}} On the other hand, what is documented is that major Pedro Crespo Suárez left in his will twenty thousand pesos to set up the classes for the university that is "in the works with the authorities".&lt;ref name=hernandez30&gt;{{harvnb|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598, the third bishop of Guatemala Gómez Fernández de Córdoba y Santillán, O.S.H., following ecclesiastical directions from the [[Council of Trent]] and on the basis of the royal decrees issued after that council, authorized the foundation of the "Nuestra Señora de la Asunción" School and Seminary, which was the first higher educational institution in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]].{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|pp=188-194}} The [[Jesuits]], who already had their Colegio de San Borja and wanted to run the Seminary themselves, opposed its foundation, as they did not like other [[regular clergy|regular orders]] - [[Mercedarians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or the leader of the [[secular clergy]] took an initiative in religious and educational matters.

The president of the Real Audiencia authorized that classes should start while they were awaiting the authorization to build the new school for the students; at the time they only had one classroom in the Dominican convent where, in theory, they gave the Arts, Theology and Religion classes.{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|p=195}} After several decades, discussions and petitions, king [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] on 31 January 1676, granted a license to the city of [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] to found a University. This would be third royal university in the Spanish Empire in America, and the second in New Spain, after the one in Mexico.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;To review the process that led to the foundation of the University of San Carlos,
it is recommended to read procedure 373 of the Guatemalan Real Audiencia en the General Archive of Indias.&lt;/ref&gt; After the disputatious process of organization, and five years after the royal decree, the university started officially its lectures of five of the nine classes, on 7 January 1681, with little more of sixty registered students and with its first president, Dr. José de Baños y Soto Mayor, who was in charge of the Cathedral, Preacher of the King of Spain and Doctor from the University of Osuna.&lt;ref name=hernandez30/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;About the first setup of the university, the historical records are not too precise and even contradictory. See in the Central American General Archive, A1. Leg. 1885, Exp. 12245.&lt;/ref&gt; The university started under the protection of [[Charles Borromeo|San Carlos Borromeo]], with its first directive written by Francisco Saraza y Arce, who copied from those of the University of México which, in turn, were adapted from the [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

==== First graduates and science teaching ====
[[File:Antonio Liendo y Goicochea.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea]], a Franciscan friar, reformed education at the University.  He was a professor of most of the eventual leaders of the Central American independence.]]
In 1660 the printer [[:es:José de Pineda Ibarra]] arrived at [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]]. Among all his works he introduced university graduation cards, where it was written what the final exam was going to be about, date and time for the exam, and the names of the university authorities and student sponsors.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

On 11 July 1717, thirty years after the its papal sanction, the first medicine student graduated; his name was Vicente Ferrer González. The next physician to graduate was Pedro Palacios y Cóbar, who presented his final exam seventeen years later; and forty-seven years after that, the eminent Dr. [[José Felipe Flores]] graduated.

The Franciscan friar Juan Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea reformed university education towards the end of the 18th century by introducing science; Chemistry, Physics, Anatomy and Mathematics; and technology studies.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

=== Second era: Science Academy ===
[[File:Retratogalvez 2014-06-22 11-25.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] during his gubernatorial term as Head of State of Guatemala&lt;br /&gt;He founded the agnostic Science Academy in substitution of the religious University of San Carlos.&lt;br /&gt;He is buried in the Museum of the University - formerly College of Law-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viaje a Guatemala|year=n.d.|url=http://www.viajeaguatemala.com/museo-nacional-de-historia-donde-guatemala-cuenta-su-pasado|journal=Viaje a Guatemala|title=Museo Nacional de Historia: donde Guatemala cuenta su pasado|accessdate=30 June 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After Independence, the University of San Carlos lost its Royal status and became simply the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" but it was in a precarious position: after the move from [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]] it had to use a borrowed building to teach, and in 1821 its new one was not finished yet; besides, the political climate of the region was very unstable at the time. In 1825, Dr. [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] was elected as president of the University, and kept the religious curriculum that the institution had had for decades. However, in 1829, the conservative regime of his brother [[Mariano de Aycinena y Piñol]] was defeated by the liberal general [[Francisco Morazán]], and the conservatives - mainly the Aycinena family - and the [[regular clergy]] were expelled from [[Central America]] and the University was suspended. In 1834, when doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] was head of State of Guatemala, he found the Science Academy in the State, which took the position that the Pontifical University had previously occupied; the new university eliminated religious education altogether and implemented clases of [[Algebra]], [[Geometry]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Physics]]; besides, the institution began to offer studies in engineering. The Academy of Science was open until 1840, because in that year the conservatives regained power in Guatemala under the strong leadership of General [[Rafael Carrera]] who reopened the old "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo";&lt;ref name=cabal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez Cabal|first=Juan|title= Universidad de Guatemala: su origen, fundación, organización|publisher=Universitaria|location=Guatemala|year=1976|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Aycinena was once again named as president of the university.

=== Third era: Pontifical University ===
{{Main article|Concordat of 1854}}

[[File:Concordato2.jpg|thumb|200px|Article #2 of the [[Concordat of 1854]] by which the Government of Guatemala entrusted the country's education to the Catholic Church]]
The power that the Catholic Church and the Aycinena family - to whom most of Carrera's advisors and secretaries belonged - had during the conservative regime in Guatemala was ratified the [[Concordat of 1854]], in which Guatemala entrusted the education of its people to the regular clergy of the Catholic Church, committed itself to respect all church property -including haciendas, monasteries and sugar mills, authorized mandatory tithing and let the bishops censor all the country's publications; in return, Guatemala obtained indulgences for Army members, was allowed to keep all those properties that had been taken from the orders in 1829 - provided they were now in private hands, received a tax of the church inconme and had the right to prosecute any priest or bishop under Guatemalan law, if necessary.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|p=1-16}} The [[concordat]] was designed by [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]], who was a cabinet member of the government - besides being the University president; then, it was first ratified by Secretary of the Interior, Justice and Ecclesiastical affairs [[Pedro de Aycinena]] and finally, approved by president [[Rafael Carrera]], who in 1854 was appointed as Guatemala's president for life.

=== Fourth era: The university during the Liberal regimes===

After the Liberal Revolution in 1871, the conservatives defeat resulted in a complete change of direction in the education in Guatemala:  once again the [[regular clergy]] was expelled from the country, and all of their properties we confiscated. The education changed from completely religious to agnostic and kept like that until 1954.

The new Liberal regime founded the Polytechnic School -Military Academy- in 1873 to prepare military engineers, topographers and telegraphers, besides military officers. In July 1875, [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] closed the Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo and in its place founded the Central College of Law and the Central College of Medicine and Pharmacy which formed the National University of Guatemala.  The government decreed that the teaching of Medicine had to be practical - as much as possible - and philosophical, with all the modern scientific theories.{{sfn|Chapa Bezanilla|2004|p=58}} In 1877, the government found the Western College of Law in [[Quetzaltenango]]{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=12}} and in 1879 founded the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcd.gob.gt/biblioteca-nacional/|title=Biblioteca Nacional|location=Guatemala|author=Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes|accessdate=26 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President general [[Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián]] (1885–1892) founded the Western College of Medicine in [[Quetzaltenango]] and granted scholarship to the best students to continue their education abroad, both from Guatemala and Quetzaltenango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museo Militar|url=http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas |journal=Museo Militar de Guatemala|title=Manuel Lisandro Barillas|year=n.d.|accessdate=7 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211055122/http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas|archivedate=11 December 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Torres|2007|p=12}}

On 21 March 1893, during the government of general [[José María Reina Barrios]], decree #193 of the [[Congress of Guatemala|National Assembly]] established that all the board of directors members, deans and faculty of the National University colleges would be appointed by the [[President of Guatemala]]; thus the colleges lost the autonomy to select their own authorities.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}}

In 1897, after the failure of the [[Exposición Centroamericana]] and the deep economic crisis that ensued, Reina Barrios implemented austerity measures that included closing the schools and University colleges.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=14}} At the end of that year, Salvador Mendieta came back to Guatemala to attend the University, but due the political stability of the times after the revolts against Reina Barrios both in the Eastern and Western regions of the country once it was known that Reina Barrios had extended his presidential term, and the closing of the university, decided to move to [[México]] in early 1898.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} However, after the assassination of president Reina Barrios on 8 February, the Guatemalan government reopened the educational institutions, claiming that they were the basis for all the Liberal institutions;  Mendieta, then, registered to begin that semester in the College of Law of the National University.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}}

==== Estrada Cabrera presidency====
{{Main article|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}

{{quote box|align=left|width=300px|At that moment, the new association started the student body reaction against the feudalist Centralamerica that prepared its students for political servility.|Salvador Mendieta&lt;br /&gt;About "El Derecho" student association&lt;br /&gt;1899}}

[[File:Medicina1907.jpg|200px|thumb|College of Medicine and Pharmacy in 1897.]]

Nicaraguan citizen Salvador Mendieta, who had already been expelled once from the Central National Institute for Boys by the former president [[José María Reyna Barrios]] for attempting to form a student association aimed at criticizing the school principal,{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} founded on 18 June 1899 along with other fellow students "El Derecho" student association.  The new association had members from the colleges of Law, Engineering and Medicine and an ideology identified with the Central American union.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5-6}} The new society became public on 15 September 1899 when the Guatemala City mayor invited some of its members to ceremonies for the Independence of Central America celebration that took place in the College of Law.

This society had several humanistic and social goals:
* gather all the Central American students around the idea of the region unity
* tighten social relationships and encourage intellectual sharing
* promote the formation of similar societies all across Central America
* organize the fight between those who think and those who oppress.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=6-7}}

Due to the strong accusations against his presidency, Estrada Cabrera closed "El Derecho" after only a year of its life, and they had Mendieta sent to prison after which he sent the Nicaraguan into exile for promoting rebellion against his government.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=7}}

In April 1899, the National Assembly submitted Estrada Cabrera a decree declaring the autonomy of the University colleges to elect their own authorities; the president vetoed the decree indicating that "''the colleges could not be autonomous given that they were dependent on the State in all senses [...]''"{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}} Therefore, the different colleges remain as dependencies of the Secretary of Public Education, which submitted a yearly review of their status, and also recommended the president who to choose as dean and faculty members. Also, by a decree published on 16 June 1900, Estrada Cabrera militarized all the male student centers, including the university colleges, who received military instruction for the six first months of their careers.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

[[File:Usac1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Facsimile of a decree published in ''El Guatemalteco'', official newspaper of Guatemala in 1907, showing that President of Guatemala appointed the National University faculty members.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 March 1907|p=4}}]]

By 1907, the colleges were:

* College of Law (seventy students)
* College of Medicine and Pharmacy (150 students)
* Dentistry institute (5 students)
* School of midwives (10 students)
* School of Engineering (15 students){{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 May 1907|p=6-7}}

Note that in 1907, the school of Engineering was part of the National University. This school, due to budget reasons, was alternatively part of the National University and the Military Academy; finally in 1908, the school was left as part of the university for good, after president Estrada Cabrera closed the Academy following a failed assassination attempt that the cadets had plotted against him.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=128}}

In  1918, the servility towards the presidents was at its peak and the university was renamed "University of Guatemala, Estrada Cabrera", by decree of the National Assembly on 2 May 1918.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|15 May 1918|p=3}} Francisco Galvez Portocarrero, close friend of the president, lobbied heavily for the new university given that in a recent trip to [[Perú]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] he liked the model the universities followed in those South American countries. Upon returning to Guatemala, Galvez - who was also a National Assembly representative- brought along a complete library about universities and convinced both the president and the Assembly members to create the "University of Guatemala".{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=15 de mayo}}

==== Carlos Herrera presidency (1920–1921) ====
{{Main article|Carlos Herrera y Luna}}

University "Estrada Cabrera", was closed after the falling of the former president. However, one of the first decrees of the new president [[Carlos Herrera y Luna]] -appointed president by the National Assembly on 8 April- was to appoint new authorities and faculty for the National University, which now had the following academic departments:{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=58}}

* College of Natural Science and Pharmacy
* College of Law
* College of Medicine
* College of engineering

Herrera y Luna, as a token of appreciation of all the efforts of the university students during the last days of Estrada Cabrera regime, gave the different colleges their autonomy to elected their own authorities, although it did not grant them full autonomy.  At this time the Student Body Association was founded and included [[Miguel Angel Asturias]], among a series of other Guatemalan intellectuals, and the second era of "El Derecho" Law student association, which had been closed by Estrada Cabrera in 1899.{{sfn|Silva H.|s.f.|p=58}}

=== Fifth era: the University after the 1944 Revolution ===
{{Main article|Guatemalan Revolution}}

After the revolution against general Ubico's successor, general [[Federico Ponce Vaides]], on 20 October 1944, the new government granted its complete autonomy to the University; Decree #12 on 11 November 1944 granted autonomy and renamed the institution as "Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala" ("University of San Carlos of Guatemala"). The university's new role was to be director of college education in Guatemala, and to cooperated in study and solution of the critical problems that Guatemala faced at the time.&lt;ref name=arzobispado&gt;{{cite journal|author=ODHA|title=Era por la vida tras por lo que íbamos|editor=Monseñor Mario Ríos Mont|year=n.d.|location=Guatemala|journal=Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispado|url=http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729151405/http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New colleges were created that time:

* College of Human Studies: created by then president Dr. [[Juan José Arévalo]] on 17 September 1945. Among its founder were Dr. [[Eduardo García Máynez]] -professor emeritus of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]- as honorary faculty. The college studied: [[Philosophy]], [[History]], [[Literature]], [[Psychology]] and [[Pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=arevalo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc3KBvf5gwI |title=Vida de Juan José Arévalo|website=Youtube|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* College of Agriculture
* College of Architecture
* College of Economics&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;

Likewise, access was granted to both women and to all the society members that had been excluded from the institution in the past.&lt;ref name=imparcial &gt;{{harvnb|El Imparcial|25 de noviembre de 1944|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After 1954 coup d'état ====
{{See also|Operation PBSUCCESS}}

Following its constitutional mandate, the university became involved in the political life of the country, presenting concrete social, economic and political proposals.  However, with the beginning of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] -major super powers that split world dominance after their victory in [[World War II]], the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959 and the influx of students from all over the social spectrum in Guatemala, Marxism became radical in the University. Besides, then archbishop of Guatemala [[Mariano Rossell y Arellano]] found out that it was urgent to recover some of the former influence [[Catholic Church]] used to have, and that it lost during the liberal regime of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] in 1872, and therefore decided to work with the [[United Fruit Company]] to get rid of the Revolutionary governments whom he accused of [[atheist]] and [[communist]]. On 4 April 1954, Rossell y Arellano issued an open letter in which he denounced Communism advances in the country, and begged Guatemalans to rise in arms and fight against the common enemy of God and the Land. His letter has published all over Guatemala, and even though he kept claiming that the Catholic Church was not seeking privileges in its anticommunist quest, Rossel y Arellano was able that after the 1954 coup, new president colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] included the following back in the new Constitution of Guatemala, for the first time since 1872:&lt;ref name=esquipulas /&gt;
* that the Catholic Church had the right to own real estate and other properties
* that religious education was declared of public interest
* that the State supported religious education
* that there were independent private universities not connected with University of San Carlos.&lt;ref name=esquipulas&gt;{{cite web|author=Esquipulas en línea|url=http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|website=Esquipulas en línea|title=Biografia de Mariano Rossell Arellano|accessdate=1 September 2014|date=n.d.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220213329/http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|archivedate=20 December 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This way, the Catholic Church recover some of the former power it held before 1871, when the Liberal Reform confiscated its properties and cancelled its privileges, in a direct attack against it as the main conservative party member of the time.

==== Nottebohm case and the Dean of the College of Law ====
{{Main article|Nottebohm case}}

[[File:Adolfo Molina Orantes 005.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor in Law [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], College of Law Dean and legal advisor of the Guatemalan delegates for the [[Nottebohm case]] before the [[International Court of Justice]].]]

Between 1951 and 1955, College of Law dean, Dr. [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], worked as a legal advisor for the Guatemalan delegation before the [[International Court of Justice]] of [[The Hague]] for the [[Nottebohm case]] (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) [1955].  The case about Mr. Nottebohm, who was born 16 September 16, 1881, in Hamburg, [[Germany]] and possessed German citizenship although he lived in Guatemala from 1905 until 1943 because he never became a citizen of Guatemala. On October 9, 1939, Nottebohm applied to become a naturalized citizen of Liechtenstein. The application was approved and he became a citizen of that country. He then returned to Guatemala on his Liechtenstein passport and informed the local government of his change of nationality. When he tried to return to Guatemala once again in 1943 he was refused entry as an enemy alien since the Guatemalan authorities did not recognize his naturalization and regarded him as still German. It has been suggested that the timing of the event was due to the recent entry of the United States and Guatemala into the Second World War. He was later extradited to the United States, where he was held at an internment camp until the end of the war. All his possessions in Guatemala were confiscated. After his release, he lived out the rest of his life in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name=icj/&gt;

The Government of Liechtenstein granted Nottebohm protection against unjust treatment by the government of Guatemala and petitioned the International Court of Justice. However, the government of Guatemala argued that Nottebohm did not gain Liechtenstein citizenship for the purposes of international law. The court agreed and thus stopped the case from continuing.
&lt;ref name=icj&gt;{{harvnb|International Court of Justice|1955|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nottebohm case was subsequently cited in many definitions of [[nationality]]. and Dr. Molina Orantes was recognized as an expert in international Law and named permanent consultant of the International Court.

==== Private universities ====

As a result of the political climate changes after the coup of 1954, the society elites decided to create their own private universities,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Universidad Rafael Landívar]] in 1961, [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]] in 1966, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in 1971, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; which would have very different ideologies from the ones presented in the University of San Carlos.  Basically the new institutions would have capitalist and liberal ideologies while the national university chose Marxism.  After heavy lobbying, in 1965 the new ISR tax law exonerated potential private universities from any kind of taxation and state contributions, and in 1966 the Law of Private Universities was approved.{{sfn|Molina|2011|p=}}

==== Research on Guatemalan history ====

In 1957 the highly regarded Marxist historian [[:es:Severo Martínez Peláez]] return to Guatemala after his exile and joined the University as a faculty member. The College of Economics dean, Rafael Piedrasanta Arandi, and the university president, Edmundo Vásquez Martínez, approved a scholarship for Martinez Pelaez to research the [[Archivo General de Indias]] in [[Sevilla]], [[Spain]] between 1967 and 1969. From this research comes his main work, ''La patria del criollo'', published in 1970, as well as the program of Economic History of Central America of the College of Economics and the total reform of the School of History in 1978.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=4}}

In 1979, due to death threats from the general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García]] regime, Martínez Peláez had to go into exile once again with his family and continued with his research and teaching activities in the [[Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]] in [[Mexico]], where he was an invited speaker in several seminars and created new curricula for the College of History.  Besides, he had important meetings with historians and Guatemalan exiles in Mexico.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=15}}

==== Veterinary medicine ====
{{See also|Veterinary medicine}}

The College of Veterinary was created on 27 September 1957,&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{harvnb|Facultad de Veterinaria y Zootenica|s.f.|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially was part of the College of Medicine and was located in the old Medicine Building in Guatemala City Historical Downtown. In 1958 and 1959 it moved into private homes that the university rented &lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; in zones 9 and 4 of Guatemala City;  it also used the University's Botanic Garden library in zone 4. By 1960, the College of Veterinary moved into its definite home in the main University campus.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

On 11 January 1969 the School of Animal Studies, which was independent of the School of Veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; and on 27 September 1974 it moved into the new modular buildings on the southwest section of the main campus, next to the Veterinary Medicine Hospital.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

===Repression and decline ===
{{Main article|Guatemala Civil War}}

During general [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] presidency, the university started suffering repression due to its position alongside the main labor unions, with three students murdered in front of the College of Law in 1962.

==== The EXMIBAL Case====
During the government of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] the possibility of giving the nickel mines in [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] in concession to a Canadian mining company was brought to the table, but it did not materialized. As soon as the general [[Carlos Arana Osorio]] took office on 1 July 1970, he reopened the case and began working in for EXMIBAL to get a concession. However, many social sectors opposed to it, arguing that it would be too costly for the country. One of the main opponents was the Commission that the [[University of San Carlos]] created to discuss the matter; among the members of the commission was the lawyer [[:es:Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López|Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López]], then representative in the [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], the respected Guatemalan intellectual [[:es:Alfonso Bauer Paiz|Alfonso Bauer Paiz]] -who had been part of the staff of presidents [[Juan José Arévalo Bermejo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzman]], and Julio Carney Herrera&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;  Both Camey Herrera and Bauer Paiz were shot in November 1970: Carney died of his wounds while Bauer Paz, severely wounded, had to go into exile.&lt;ref name=rakosy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|website=MAC: Mines and communities|title=Victimization - the EXMIBAL Story|last=Rakosy|first=Betsy|year=2002|accessdate=17 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082651/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|archivedate=6 October 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission members had strongly opposed the conditions proposed by the Government to grant the concession EXMIBAL; after the attack against Bauer Paiz and Carney, on 13 February 1971 Mijangos López was assassinated by unknown assailants as he left his office long the 4th Avenue in Zone 1 of the [[Guatemala City]]. Mijangos Lopez had been under the fatal impression that the government was not going to assassinate him because he was on a wheelchair since 1958.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

On 8 May 1971, Arana Osorio's administration finally granted the concession to EXMIBAL;&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt; it covered 385 square kilometers in the area of [[El Estor]], with and initial investment of US$228 million. The mine, built in the mountains of indigenous maya Q'eqchi people, included a residential complex of 700 homes, numerous offices, a hospital, a small shopping center, school, a golf course and a large area for industrial processing.&lt;ref name=rakosy/&gt;

==== Laugerud and Lucas García military governments====
{{Main article|Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Guatemalan Civil War}}

During the military governments of the seventies, the tension between the government and the university kept growing, until it reached its peak in 1978 during the massive demonstration that occurred to protest rising urban public transportation costs. The Association of University Students (AEU) had a leading role in the protests, but this brought persecution of their leaders and the murder of the secretary general of the association [[Oliverio Castañeda de León]], on 20 October of that year.  Just fifteen days after the murder of Castañeda de León, was missing his successor, Antonio Ciani García, and over the next 18 months almost every student leader and university faculty with political connections were threatened (even with the legal parties). Whoever did not paid attention and continued with their protest activities, was simply killed or kidnapped.

In early 1979, the following attacks occurred against renowned members of the University:
* On 25 January 1979,  [[Alberto Fuentes Mohr]], Doctor of Economics, [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] representative, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and former Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs during the administration of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]], was murdered.
* That same day, but a few hours later, was shot and killed the student and union leader Ricardo Martinez Solorzano.
* On 14 February, Manuel Lisandro Andrade Roca, general secretary of the University in the tenure of [[Saúl Osorio Paz]] as university president -and a student leader during the "Marches of 1962"- was killed.
* On 22 March, former Guatemala City mayor [[Manuel Colom Argueta]] was killed, in an operation in which his murderers allegedly used a helicopter to direct the operation&lt;ref name=Aguilera&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilera Peralta|Romero Imery|1981|pp=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colom had been director of Center for Urban and Regional Studies (CEUR) of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala and a political leader of the United Revolutionary Front (FUR). Next to Fuentes Mohr, he was the most prominent members of the legal political opposition and their deaths ended, even more, the political space in Guatemala. These murders and threats against leaders of the FUR and the PSD continued in 1979 and 1980, and in subsequent years against the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy]] party.
At the University, university president [[Saúl Osorio Paz]], after attacks on his colleagues and death threats against him, began to live in presidency, protected by student brigades of the communist FRENTE student party. In an unprecedented case, the president directed the University from underground for almost two years.&lt;ref name=Aguilera/&gt;

The effect of state repression was worse on the student movement: the AEU ended decimated. Despite all this, the association continued to be a belligerent organization during this campaign of terror. To protect themselves, the AEU restructured its organizational form such that their leaders were not so vulnerable, and declined to reveal their names.

In January 1979, a new freshmen generation arrived to the university. Many of them had been members of the CEEM or student associations in the public institutes and had participated in the events of October 1978. It was them who took the leadership of the AEU. But it was much more difficult to replace the fallen or exiled faculty, which resulted in a marked decline in the academic quality of the institution.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda/&gt; Later, laws that severely restricted the university autonomy were proposed, and violating the constitutional mandate to give 5% of the national budget to the institution became commonplace for the government.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda&gt;{{harvnb|Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico: Agudización|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burning the Spain Embassy in Guatemala ====
{{See also|Guatemalan Civil War}}

On 31 January 1980, several students from the University of San Carlos advised a k'iche' peasant group who wanted to let the world know about their precarious situation; when  the country's newspapers did not dare to publish their demands, and after all legal avenues to be heard had been exhausted, the group decided to take the premises of the Embassy of Spain and use it as a platform for their demands.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] had visited the k'iche' farmer communities a few months before, and had gathered information for a report on them, which was never published, but the draft of which still exists.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of the government of general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] was strong and direct: police surrounded the premises of the Embassy and after several hours of siege, the situation ended with the burning of the room where all the people who were inside the embassy had taken refugre, including almost the entire Embassy staff and some random visitors, including former vice president of Guatemala, [[Eduardo Cáceres Lehnhoff]] and former Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Adolfo Molina Orantes]].&lt;ref name=niunovivo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=FG6fh9M8wdc |title = Ni uno vivo|website=YouTube|accessdate = July 2, 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two survivors were Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] and peasant Gregorio Yuja Xona, who were taken to the Private Hospital Herrera Llerandi. Yuja was kidnapped there and a group tried to kidnap the ambassador, but he was taken from the hospital just in time by the Ambassador of Costa Rica in Guatemala; Cajal left the country that night. Yuja, meanwhile, was tortured and his body thrown off the premises of the President mansion at the University of San Carlos. His body was buried in the Heroes and Martyrs Plaza on Central Campus.&lt;ref name=niunovivo /&gt;

==== 1985 civil unrest: military invasion of Central Campus ====
{{Main article|Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores}}

During the government of general [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores]], the Mutual Support Group (GAM) -led by [[Nineth Montenegro]]- was founded{{sfn|Siglo 21|9 July 2010|p=}} and the High School Student Coordination Group (CEEM) also gained considerable strength. The latter was formed by students from the Central National Institute for Boys, the Central Normal Institute for Young Ladies Belén and Rafael Aqueche&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;By 1985, the economic elites had left Guatemala City downtown, along with these once premier schools which now were attended by the low middle and low income areas of the city.&lt;/ref&gt;  which organized mass protests in September 1985 against the rising prices for public transportation. At least ten people died in Guatemala City in the most extensive wave of urban unrest since protests against the government of [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] in August 1978. The unrest began with demonstrations against rising prices public transportation but then became widespread due to the bad economic situation the country was in at the time. Burning of buses, blockades and massive protests that resulted in destruction of public infrastructure occurred almost every day. The government responded with three thousand Army soldiers, whom supported by light armored forces and the riot squad of the National Police, were deployed in central and peripheral areas of the city. Also, the night of 3 September 1985 the University of San Carlos of Guatemala was occupied by the military who allegedly found an underground shooting range subversive propaganda.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

Several hundred people were arrested and General Mejia Víctores addressed the nation through a television and radio address in which he announced measures to address prevailing social unrest. General Mejia announced public schools closure until further notice and the freezing of prices of consumer goods;&lt;ref name=elpais85&gt;{{harvnb|El País|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the end, as part of the process solution a high school student bonus was granted to both elementary and high schools so they could be transported free in public transportation, plus all the public school students were promoted by decree. Students who graduated by decree in 1985 were received with brutal initiations by the different student bodies through the University.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

==== Constitution of 1985: Election of judges and university representatives before government institutions====

{{Quote box|align=right|width=400px|Article 215. Election of the Supreme Court&lt;br/&gt;.

The judges of the Supreme Court shall be elected by [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] for a period of five years, from a list of twenty-six candidates proposed by a nominating committee consisting of a representative of the Presidents of the Universities of the country, who presides, the Deans of the Colleges of Law, an equal number of representatives elected by the General Assembly of the Association of Lawyers and Notaries of Guatemala and by an equal number of representatives elected by the judges holders the Court of Appeal and other courts that Article 217 of the Constitution refers to.

Article 269. Integration of the Constitutionality Court.

|Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala, 1985.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=169}}}}

After the murder or forced exile of most of its faculty, the stability of the College of Law after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] was recovered with deanship of Cipriano Soto Tobar, who took office in 1988. Soto Tobar took a significant effort on hiring faculty. However, his main goal was to establishg political networks to favor political lobbies exploiting the new role that the Constitution assigned to the University of San Carlos:&lt;ref name=veliz&gt;{{cite web|last=Véliz|first=Rodrigo|url=https://nomada.gt/que-hicieron-los-profesores-de-derecho-para-que-la-usac-perdiera-prestigio/|title=¿Qué hizo Derecho para que la USAC perdiera prestigio?|year=2014|location=Guatemala|website=Nómada|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, enacted in 1985, entrusted the College of Law and the University of San Carlos with the task of naming representatives to the process of election of judges of the highest courts of the land,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=169-170}} as well as the Comptroller General of Accounts,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=180-181}} and the Chief Public Prosecutor {{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=197}} Also, the University was given the power to send a judge to the Constitutionality Court.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=214}}

These networks took hold and strengthened thru the nineties setting up relationships with institutions and society sectors that were not associated as a university. After leaving the deanship, the University Council nominated Soto to the Constitutionality Court, although there were persistent rumors that he was selling diplomas and certificates. However, his application was accepted because his involvement in these felonies could not be proved because no credible evidence was presented.{{sfn|Hernández Pico|2001|p =}} Two of his performances in the Constitutionality Court showed possible political compromise: first, he voted to validate an illegal adoption network and, then he voted in favor of the registration as a presidential candidate of general [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], despite the prohibition of the 1985 Constitution, which does not allowed as a candidate anybody that had been part of a coup d'état.{{sfn|Castillo Zamora|2013|p=}} In those years, adoption networks operating in Guatemala could collect up to US$60,000 per child and went from delivering 1200 children in 1997 to more than four thousand in 2004.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

Estuardo Galvez, who took that Dean office in 2000 -and later went on to become university president, was one of the members of the networks established by Soto; realizing the importance of the Bar Association, which was also a participant in the election of judges -and until then controlled by lawyers linked to the traditional capital of the country- Galvez sought from the beginning of his term to favor his post graduate students placing them in public institutions so that they could show their loyalty with favorable votes in the Bar elections.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt; After several elections, and once Galvez was no longer Dean, the network that Soto set up beat the traditional capital lawyers in the Bar Association elections by 300 votes; as recorded in the minutes, the majority of his votes were young lawyers -his former students.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

==== Student leaders murders in 1989====

In 1987, the president of the Student Association "El Derecho" (AED), Willy Ligorría, was expelled from the Association of University Students (AEU) for embezzling funds from the [[Huelga de Dolores]] Committee, for his direct involvement in an embezzlement money of the association and usurpation of functions and for signing as acting as General Secretary in various activities and international documents.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; After his departure, a series of death threats against members of the board of the AEU began: in 1989 there was a steady escalation of threats, some of them signed by death squads as "the Dolorosa", the "Jaguar of Justice" or "Secret Anticommunist-Army". Despite his expulsion, Ligorría, maintained a very high and combative profile, while his close friend, Marco Tulio Montenegro, was still part of AEU.&lt;ref name=rehmi89&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.derechoshumanos.net/lesahumanidad/informes/guatemala/informeREMHI-Tomo2.htm#t2c3-m20|author=Informe REMHI|journal=Fundación Acción Pro-Derechos Humanos|title=Proyecto Interdiocesano de Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica |year=n.d.|accessdate=23 October 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, several student body leaders returned to Guatemala from exile intending to achieve a resurgence of student coordination, which was practically dismantled since the seventies. But on August 21, Iván Ernesto Gonzalez was arrested and kinapped; the next day, Carlos Contreras Conde, leader of the University Student Movement (MEU), was abducted near the university. That same day Hugo Leonel Gramajo was abducted and introduced in a red pick-up with foreign plates. On 23 August, Victor Hugo Rodriguez Jaramillo and Silvia Azurdia Utrera founders of MEU, were kidnapped and taken violenty amid two cars that blocked their way. And Mario De León left a press conference that the Student Body held that day at around 19:45 hours and was detained by the National Police and has not been seen again since.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; Finally, Aaron Ochoa disappeared the next day.

During an emergency meeting in which the response to the government offensive was being discussed, Willy Ligorría called to say that he knew where Hugo Gramajo and Aaron Ochoa were hidden and that he could bring the still free student leaders to them. In September other members of the student movement, Carlos Chutá Carney, Carlos Humberto Cabrera and Carlos Palencia were kidnapped and found dead shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;

After the murders of the student leaders, Ligorría spoke at some rallies in college and participated in the demonstrations that took place.  On Saturday September 15 at 14:15 hours he left for Panamá along with Marco Tulio Montenegro and Byron Milian Vicente. Montenegro returned to Guatemala on 11 November 1989 to rejoin the AEU, but he was already a suspect, and was killed with knife soon after. Meanwhile, Ligorría was appointed Head of Research of Public Prosecutions.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;According to research that was subsequently conducted, it was determined that Ligorría had strong ties with a "gang" of zone 18, whose members went armed at all times; College students suspected that the "maras" had been formed by the army. Ligorría was also affiliated with the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD) and even wasted money in their university activities, although he always maintained a revolutionary speech, was a member of ORPA and maintained contact with Danilo Rodriguez, chief of the FAR.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 1997, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, which became a political party after the peace accords, formally accused Ligorría for his involvement in the murder of the student leader, claiming that he was a member of military intelligence.

The '''Woods Hole Research Center''' (WHRC) is a scientific research organization that studies climate change impacts and solutions. WHRC was named the world's top climate change think tank for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 by the International Center for Climate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20160701/NEWS/160709923|title=Woods Hole think tank takes top spot on climate change|last=Driscoll|first=Sean|date=July 1, 2016|work=Cape Cod Times|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center conducts research on the causes and impacts of climate change throughout the tropics, the Arctic, and North America. All of WHRC's work is designed to inform policy or answer policy questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whrc.org/our-work/interactive-map/|title=Woods Hole Research Center - Where We Work|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Woods Hole Research Center|access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/12/09/a-paris-climate-agreement-is-supposed-to-help-save-the-planet-but-the-planet-may-have-other-ideas/|title=How the Earth itself could undermine a Paris climate agreement|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=December 9, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gustavo-silvachavez/forests-emerge-as-a-big-w_b_8793226.html|title=Forests Emerge as a Big Winner in Paris Agreement|last=Silva-Chavez|first=Gustavo|date=December 12, 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
WHRC's mission is to advance scientific discovery and seek science-based solutions for the world’s environmental and economic challenges through research and education.

== History ==
The Woods Hole Research Center was established in 1985 in [[Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]] by [[George Woodwell]]. WHRC was one of the first organizations dedicated to fighting global climate change and Woodwell testified to Congress in 1986 about the dangers of sea level rise and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/11/30-years-ago-scientists-warned-congress-on-global-warming-what-they-said-sounds-eerily-familiar/|title=30 years ago scientists warned Congress on global warming. What they said sounds eerily familiar|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=June 11, 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan for developing the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was drafted at the Woods Hole Research Center in the late 1980s by Woodwell and Kiliparti Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/paris-agreement-effect-much-work-remains-stabilize-climate#stream/0|title=Paris Agreement in Effect, But Much Work Remains to Stabilize Climate|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 7, 2016|work=WCAI|access-date=January 4, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Dr. [[John P. Holdren]] became the director and he continued to lead the organization until he was appointed as President Obama's science advisor in 2009.  Holdren returned to WHRC as a senior advisor in 2017 after President Obama left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20170302/former-obama-science-adviser-returns-to-cape|title=Former Obama science adviser returns to Cape|last=Fraser|first=Doug|work=capecodtimes.com|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's current president is Dr. Philip Duffy, a physicist who was formerly the White House [[National Science and Technology Council]]’s Senior Advisor to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/meet-directors-three-new-presidents-take-helm-woods-hole#stream/0|title=Meet the Directors: Three New Presidents Take the Helm in Woods Hole|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 2, 2015|work=WCAI|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHRC has about 60 staff members.

'''Zwi Migdal''' ({{lang-yi|צבי מגדל}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈtsvɪ mɪɡˈdal|IPA}}) was a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] 19th and 20th-century [[organized crime]] group, based mainly in [[Argentina]], that was involved in the [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] of Jewish women from the [[shtetl]]s of [[Central Europe]] for [[sexual slavery]] and [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref name=perush&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarfitz|first=Mir|title=Caftens, Kurvehs, and Stille Chuppahs: Jewish Sex Workers and their Opponents in Buenos Aires, 1890-1930|url=http://perush.cjs.ucla.edu/index.php/volume-2/jewish-urban-history-in-comparative-perspective-jewish-buenos-aires-and-jewish-los-angeles/-6-mir-yarfitz-caftens-kurvehs-and-stille-chuppahs-jewish-sex-workers-and-their-opponents-in-buenos-aires-1890-1930|work=Perush: An Online Journal of Jewish Scholarship and Interpretation. Volume 2.|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=February 8–9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==
The founders, having originated from [[Warsaw]], called the organization the Varsovia Jewish Mutual Aid Society. In 1927, after the [[Poland|Polish]] envoy in [[Argentina]] filed an official complaint against them with the local authorities regarding their use of "Warsaw" in the name, they changed it to Zwi Migdal in honor of Luis Zvi Migdal, one of the founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guy|first=Donna J|title=Sex and Danger in Buenos Aires: Prostitution, Family, and Nation in Argentina|year=1992|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cT8CrTRVKAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BXxOTd7OOcP68AbKiI22Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Zwi Migdal organization operated from the 1860s to 1939. After the [[First World War]], it had four hundred members in [[Argentina]]. Its annual turnover was fifty million dollars at the turn of the century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Its center was [[Buenos Aires]], with branch offices in [[Brazil]] ([[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]]), [[United States]] ([[New York City]]), [[Poland]] ([[Warsaw]]), [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="kushnir"&gt;Kushnir, Beatriz; Baile de Máscaras, Imago Editora, São Paulo. {{ISBN|85-312-0485-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zwi Migdal Organization reached its peak in the 1920s: 430 ruffians, or [[pimp]]s, controlled 2,000 [[brothel]]s with 4,000 women in Argentina alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html "Argentine Jewry's dark secret" by Rona Kupferboim [[Ynetnews]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's success stemmed from the fact that its members were bound by rules that were "based on order, discipline, and honesty." The network was well-organized and members cooperated closely to protect their interests.

== Modus operandi ==
The organization lured girls and young women from Europe in several ways. For instance, a well-mannered and elegant-looking man would appear in a poor Jewish village in [[Poland]] or [[Russia]]. He would advertise his search for young women to work in the homes of wealthy Jews in Argentina by posting an ad in the local synagogue. Fearful of pogroms and often in desperate economic circumstances, the parents would send their daughters away with these men, hoping to give them a fresh start. Another popular ruse was to find pretty girls and marry them, usually in a ceremony known as a "shtille chupah" ([[Yiddish]] expression meaning a quick wedding ceremony). The girls bade their families farewell and boarded ships to Argentina believing that they were on their way toward a better future. Their period of training as sex slaves often started on the ship. Some of them were married off to local men so that they could obtain entry visas.

Prostitutes who failed to satisfy their clients were beaten, fined or sent to work in provincial houses. Every business transaction was logged. The rufianes held a "meat market" in which newly arrived girls were paraded naked in front of traders in places such as Hotel Palestina and [[Cafe Parisienne]]. These activities went on undisturbed because the brothels were frequented by government officials, judges and journalists. City officials, politicians and police officers were bribed. The pimps had powerful connections everywhere. The largest [[brothels]] in Buenos Aires housed as many as 60 to 80 [[sex slave]]s. Although there were brothels all over Argentina, most were in Buenos Aires, in the Jewish quarter on Junin Street.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Influence of the organization ==
The organization had arms in several countries, and was a controversial presence in [[South America]]'s Jewish community.  It was a supporter of [[Yiddish theatre]] in [[Brazil]], but was attacked by Jews in [[Rio de Janeiro]] for presenting [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]].  A great number of Jews who had come to Brazil did so as [[family|families]], and viewed [[prostitution]] as immoral and "impure" influences.  Zwi Migdal's attempt to relocate to Rio, after events in [[Buenos Aires]] (discussed below), caused an increased battle against the group among [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Brazilian Jews]].&lt;ref name="lesser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c8JghimnHDsC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wn1OTYXvIIP98Ab0yLytDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Lesser, Jeff. Weloming the Undesirables: Brazil and the Jewish Question. University of California Press, 1995, pgs 34-38]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shunning by Jewish community ==
As the pimps prospered, the Argentinian Jewish community rejected them. Articles condemning the rufianes appeared in the local press, and in 1885, the community established the Jewish Association for the Protection of Women and Girls. Notices posted on the walls of the Jewish quarter warned locals not to rent to the rufianes. Nevertheless, the pimps aspired to be part of the community. The wealthiest were patrons of the [[Secular Jewish culture#Theatre|Jewish theater]], which was the center of Jewish cultural life in Buenos Aires. Despite their trade, Zwi Migdal members donated funds for the construction of synagogues and other community buildings. Community leaders were divided on whether to accept these donations, some fearing that accepting "dirty" money would legitimize the exploitation of women.  Later the "tmeyim" (unclean), as they were known, pimps and prostitutes alike, were banned from synagogues and refused burial in the local Jewish cemetery.

== Splinter groups ==
Zwi Migdal later split and a splinter group led by [[Simon Rubinstein (pimp)|Simon Rubinstein]] established its own society named [[Ashkenazum]]. Once officially recognized, both associations bought plots of land on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and established their own cemeteries there.

== Downfall ==
[[File:Raquel Liberman.PNG|thumb|[[Raquel Liberman]] in the 1930s.]]
The organization worked to force [[Raquel Liberman]] ([[Berdychiv]], Ukraine 1900-Buenos Aires, Argentina 1935),&lt;ref&gt;[https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/liberman-raquel Glickman, Nora. "Raquel Liberman." Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive.] (Visited September 6th 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; a former prostitute, to return to prostitution.  Liberman had emigrated to Argentina after her husband, who died a year after her arrival, leaving her with two small sons.  
To support them she worked as prostitute, until saving enough money to open an antique shop, which was later raided by local [[pimps]] who robbed her of her savings and forced her back to prostitution. There Liberman contacted the police superintendent, Julio Alsogaray, whom she had heard would not accept [[Bribery|bribes]] from Zwi Migdal, and was looking for ways to destroy the organization. Slipping into his office one day, she gave detailed testimony on the workings of Zwi Migdal, thus enabling the police to launch an extensive investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html Kupferboim, Rona. Argentine Jewry's Dark Secret. Article in Ynetnews.com about Ilan Sheinfeld's book. Published May 25th, 2007] (Visited December 3rd, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The case was handled by an investigative [[judge]], Dr. Rodriguez Ocampo, who also refused to be bribed.  The lengthy [[trial]] ended in September 1930, with 108 criminal convictions. "''The very existence of the Zwi Migdal Organization directly threatens our society''," Judge Ocampo wrote in his [[verdict]], handing down long [[prison]] sentences.  The pimps appealed their sentences from prison in January 1931, and senior Justice Ministry officials released all but three of them.  After this was reported in the media, public outrage convinced the authorities to rescind the releases. Later, hundreds of pimps were deported to [[Uruguay]], but slowly returned over the years, one by one.

== Zwi Migdal in Brazil ==
The first boatload of young Jewish women arrived in Brazil in 1867. In 1872, the imperial Brazilian government extradited some Jewish pimps and prostitutes, but the criminal activities continued. The brothels were concentrated in a few streets near downtown, in the Mangue neighborhood, a city zone where prostitution was segregated and legally authorized. As most of the prostitutes came from Poland, they were called "''polacas''" ("Polish women") and this word acquired a scornful meaning in Brazilian Portuguese language.

By 1913, there were 431 brothels controlled by the Zwi Migdal in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. They were concentrated in a few streets near downtown, in the ''Mangue'' neighborhood, a city zone where prostitution was commonplace and tolerated.

The prostitutes, largely illiterate, poor and despised by the mainstream Jewish community, banded together to form their own self benevolent societies. In 1906 they formed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] their own [[Chesed Shel Emes]] or Society of True Charity, formally registered as "Associação Beneficente Funerária e Religiosa Israelita" - ABFRI (Jewish Benevolent Association for Burial and Religion). Note that this organization was created and run by women exploited by Zwi Migdal and other Jewish crime syndicates, but they had no connection with criminal activities.

That social and religious organization was created and managed mainly by the Polish-Jewish  prostitutes ("''polacas''") exploited by Jewish crime syndicates. Their main goals, they wrote in the founding charter, were: "to set up a synagogue, and there practice all the ceremonies of the Jewish religion; to grant sick members in need of treatment outside the city a third-class train ticket and three pounds sterling; to grant members a third-class funeral." Despite their troubled life and social despise, these women never forgot that they were Jewish.

Using their association savings, they purchased real-state properties and founded their own cemetery in 1916 and their own synagogue in 1942. In its heyday, several Brazilian cities had its own Chesed Shel Emes associations and several rabbis, all since deceased, were employed by the communities. Rio de Janeiro's Chesed Shel Emes association was the largest one. It was led by one of their own elected freely and called "Irmã Superiora" ("superior sister"), who used a large blue ribbon across her chest during reunions and feasts.

The [[Buenos Aires]] police enforcement, led by [[Julio Rodolfo Alsogaray|Julio Alsogaray]], gave a deep blow in Jewish crime syndicates that affected their activities even in [[Brazil]]. The destruction of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe during the World War II eliminated the last links between South American and European Jewish crimes syndicates. After 1939, the Jewish women traffic ceased, but Jewish women could be found in the Brazilian prostitution zones until the end of the 1950s.

Rio de Janeiro's Chesed Shel Emes had four "Irmãs Superioras" ("superior sisters"); the last one was Rebeca Freedman, also known as Rebeka Fridman or "''dona'' Beka" (Ms. Beka). The other women used to refer to her as their queen. Although born in Poland, she came to Brazil around 1916 from the United States when she was about 35 years old. Certainly she followed some connections between New York and [[Rio de Janeiro]] crime syndicates. Deeply religious, she made her mission to perform the sacred ''[[Tumah and taharah|tahara]]'' ceremony of washing the dead and provide a proper Jewish burial for all her "sisters". She died in 1984 at the age of 103.

The Jewish women benevolent organizations ceased to exist when all their members died, married or moved to other cities. As no new member joined, the number of "sisters" dwindled and their association assets were eventually donated to or purchased by the "respectable" Jewish associations. As part of the bargain, some women were accepted in their final days in Jewish rest homes for elderly people, but many of them died in deep poverty in public rest home with beggars. Some of them married Jews or non-Jewish men and were absorbed by the respectful Brazilian society. Most of the resistance to tell their History can be attributed to their descendants who live today a very comfortable and prominent life.

=== Legacy ===
The cemeteries created by the Jewish prostitutes associations were the starting point in the recognition and interest in those women's history. They are being restored and preserved by members of the Brazilian Jewish community despite the heavy opposition of other members who feel uneasy or ashamed about the past of their friends, fellows or ancestors. In [[Cubatão]] City, [[São Paulo State]], there is a Jewish cemetery that was recently restored. In [[São Paulo]] City, due to municipal ordinances, almost all the Jewish women's tombs were removed in 1971 from their original place in Chora-Menino Cemetery to anonymous tombs close to the walls of the Butantã Jewish Cemetery. Recently, some members of the Jewish community respectfully engraved on each tombstone the name of each woman there buried. In [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Chesed Shel Emes' Cemetery, located close to the Inhaúma Cemetery, with almost 800 tombs, is abandoned, but some social organizations work to protect, restore and preserve it.

=== Brazilian Portuguese vocabulary ===
The word "cafetão" (pimp) is derived from [[caftan]],&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;Cunha, Antonio Geraldo da. Dicionário Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa. Editora Nova Fronteira, Rio de Janeiro, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; the long coat traditionally used by Eastern Europe Jews. The word "polaca" (Polish woman), as well as "la polaquita" ( a little Pole, feminin, sub.) is commonly used in countries where Portuguese is spoken, but in Brazil it became extremely offensive to Polish people because it was used as synonymous to prostitute.&lt;ref name="lesser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agosin"/&gt; So the words "polonesa" and "polonês" (Polish woman and Polish man) were created and are the only socially accepted in Brazil to name people from Poland.&lt;ref name="etymology"/&gt; As French pimps mainly from [[Marseille]] also bought women from to work as prostitutes in Brazil, the word "''francesa''" (Frenchwoman) also had the same fate, but it is still used in Brazilian Portuguese without a pejorative meaning. The word "encrenca", nowadays meaning trouble, derived from the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] "en krenk" (a sick one, similar to the German "ein Kranker"), and originally referred to a man with venereal diseases.

== Cultural and literary references ==
The trafficking of women for sex work found mention in Yiddish literature. Among theater plays which raised the subject were Peretz Hirschbein’s “Miriam” (1905-1908) and the directly focused Leib Malach’s "Ibergus" (1927).&lt;ref name=perush /&gt; Among Yiddish prose, the subject featured in [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s "The Man from Buenos Aires" (Yiddish: “Der Mentsch fun Buenos Aires,” 1909, English: 1987)&lt;ref name=perush /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miron|first=Dan|title=Journey to the Twilight Zone: on Shalom Aleichem's Railroad Stories|work=The Image of the Shtetl and Other Studies of Modern Jewish Literary Imagination|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=268|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aleichem|first1=Sholem|title=Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories|year=1987|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|first2=Hillel|last2=Halkin|chapter=The Man from Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s "Scum" (Yiddish: "Shoym", year?; English: 1991).

The 1979 movie ''[[Last Embrace]]'' by [[Jonathan Demme]] (based on the novel ''[[The Thirteenth Man (novel)|The Thirteenth Man]]'' by [[Murray Teigh Bloom]] and a screenplay by [[David Shaber]]&lt;ref name="Glickman2"&gt;[http://www.tandfebooks.com/doi/pdf/10.4324/9780203905128?isOnline=false The Jewish White Slave Trade and the Untold Story of Raquel Liberman], page 51, [[Nora Glickman]], [[Latin American Studies]], Volume 14, [[Garland Reference Library of Social Science]], Volume 2130. {{ISBN|0-203-90512-1}}, {{ISBN|0-203-90605-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) features a woman who, taking the role of the biblical avenger [[Goel Hadam]], serially kills the members of the New York [[Lower East Side]] Zwi Migdal who enslaved her grandmother.

The 1991 movie ''[[Naked Tango]]'' by [[Leonard Schrader]] alludes to the activities of Zwi Migdal.&lt;ref name="Glickman"&gt;Glickman, Nora. The Jewish White Slave Trade and the Untold Story of Raquel Liberman.  Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-203-90512-1}} / {{ISBN|978-0-203-90512-8}}. ([https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=ABsfWWlxeYIC&amp;q=naked+tango#v=snippet&amp;q=naked%20tango&amp;f=false online])&lt;/ref&gt; The film's heroine assumes the identity of an Eastern European woman traveling to Buenos Aires to meet a prospective husband and in the process gets herself caught up in the prostitution network. The film, however, is motivated more by sensationalism than by indignation.

The 2001 movie ''[[:pt:Sonhos Tropicais|Sonhos Tropicais]]'' ("Tropical Dreams"), directed by André Sturm, also deals with the same topic, following Esther, a Jewish girl from Poland lured into a false promise of marriage, who finds herself enslaved in brothels in Rio de Janeiro from 1899 to 1904. As a background, the film shows the [[Vaccine Revolt]] in the city.
