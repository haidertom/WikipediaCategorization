      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">The '''Spanish Newspaper Publishers' Association''' ({{lang-es|Asociación de Editores de Diarios Españoles}}; '''AEDE''') is a [[trade association]] for Spanish [[newspaper publisher]]s based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==Early life==
Abdul Latief was born on April 27, 1940, in [[Banda Aceh]], [[Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam]]. He was bought up according to [[Muslim]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] traditions. Latief's father was a textile trader and his mother was an activist in Aisyiyah (a part of the [[Muhammadiyah]] Islamic organization). In 1950, Latief's family moved from [[Banda Aceh]] to [[Jakarta]].

While at school, he performed well enough academically to become the best student. After graduating, Latief worked as head of promotion in the [[Sarinah]] department store. He also attended in-store management courses in Tokyo, Japan. In 1972, Latief founded the Young Indonesian Entrepreneur Community, known as HIPMI, and he was elected as leader for 1972–73.

==Business career==
After working for about nine years in department stores, in 1972 Latief decided he wanted to own a department store, but had to settle for a variety store. Starting from a mini store in [[Grogol Petamburan|Grogol]], [[Jakarta]], Latief and his brother, Abdul Muthalib, founded PT Latief Marda Corporation. Two years later, they founded PT Indonesia Product Centre Sarinah Jaya, with brand name [[Pasaraya]]. In 2001, Latief expanded his business into television, by establishing the [[Lativi]] television channel. Latief is also involves in the property business with the La Piaza development in [[Kelapa Gading]], [[North Jakarta]]. Today, all of his business in retailing, media, property, advertising, finance and agrobusiness are grouped in the Latief Corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">'''Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen''' (7 September 1903 – 11 February 1992) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[locomotive]] designer and engineer. 
Giesl-Gieslingen was born in 1903 in [[Trento|Trient]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], and studied at the [[Technische Universität Wien|Technical College]] in [[Vienna]]. In 1924 he published a technical article on smokebox design and chimneys.&lt;ref name="SR182"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Names behind the names: Dr Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen  | journal = Steam Railway | issue = 182  |pages=75  | publisher = EMAP Apex Publications Ltd  | location = Peterborough  | date = June 1995  | issn = 	0143-7232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he received his diploma as an engineer, and began working as a design engineer at the [[Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf|Floridsdorf locomotive works]],&lt;ref name="SR182" /&gt; where he was involved in the construction of the [[ÖBB Class 12|Class 214]] 2-8-4s. While at Floridorf he continued his studies, being interested in developing the rectangular chimney design developed by Golsdorf in Austria, and finished his doctoral thesis on locomotive front-end design in 1929.

==To the USA==
In 1929 the director, Arno Demmer, sent him to the United States, where he stayed until 1938, working on the [[New York Central Railroad]] testing a [[Kyösti Kylälä|Kylala]] [[blastpipe]].&lt;ref name="SR182" /&gt; There he got to know his wife, whom he married in 1933 in [[New York City|New York]].

==Return to Austria==
After his return he became Demmer's assistant and, after the [[Second World War]], chief engineer of the Floridsdorf company. In 1946 he took up his post as honorary professor at the Technical College in Vienna as the successor to [[Johann Rihosek]].

==Giesl ejector==
[[File:Smokebox with Giesl-ejector 534-03.jpg|thumb|Smokebox with Giesl-ejector on the ČSD 534.0432 in museum Lužná u Rakovníka, Czech Republic]]
He developed the [[Giesl ejector]] for steam locomotives, which he patented and allowed to be sold by the Schoeller-Bleckmann works. The first notable application of this was to an Austrian 2-8-4 where fitting of the Giesl ejector produced a 25% increase in power output and a small saving in coal.&lt;ref name="SR182" /&gt; As a result, Giesl ejectors were fitted to locomotives in Austria, East Germany, East Africa and Czechoslovakia. [[BR Standard Class 9F|British Railways 9F locomotive]] No. 92250 was tested at Rugby with a Giesl ejector which demonstrated its effectiveness but due to imminent dieselisation no other locomotives were so fitted. Giesl later published several books on the subject of steam locomotive technology through the Viennese publishers of ''Verlag Slezak''. The effectiveness of the Giesl ejector, being slightly better than the [[Kylchap]] exhaust, has led to two preserved locomotives in the UK being fitted with it; [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes|Bulleid Pacific]] No. 34092 ''City of Wells'' and [[BR standard class 2 2-6-0]] No. 78022.&lt;ref name="SR182" /&gt;

==Death==
Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen died on 11 February 1992 in Vienna.

In the United States, '''annual enrollment''' (also known as '''open enrollment''' or '''open season''') is a period of time, usually but not always occurring once per year, when employees of companies and organizations may make changes to their elected [[fringe benefit]] options, such as [[health insurance]].  The term also applies to the annual period during which individuals may buy individual health insurance plans through the online, state-based [[health insurance exchange]]s established by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. Annual enrollment is also prominent in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], where almost 50 million enrollees can choose to stay in original Medicare, or join or change plans within the [[Medicare Advantage]] and [[Medicare Part D]] Prescription Drug programs for the coming calendar year. Individuals usually can make changes to, or sign up for, their health insurance or fringe benefits only once per year during the annual enrollment period or when they have experienced a specific [[qualifying event]].

During this time period, an employer will typically communicate to all eligible employees what options they have for their benefit program.  Often the vendors or insurance providers will be present to explain the details of their products. This can be done either with group presentations, "benefit fairs" or meetings one on one with each employee. As travel expenses continue to rise many vendors and insurance providers have turned to using independent "contract enrollers" to do the communication on their behalf.

Open season is a prominent feature of the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] during which some 3 million Federal civilian employees and retirees may choose among several dozen health insurance plans for the coming year. Open season is scheduled in the fall each year, and plan enrollment decisions take effect in the following calendar year.

== Annual enrollment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ==

Under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], annual enrollment, or open enrollment, is the period that people in the United States who need health insurance can sign up for an individual insurance plan.  Unless someone experiences a "qualifying event" outside of the annual enrollment period, annual enrollment is the only time to sign up for individual health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Annual enrollment used to last for three months; the 2016 cycle lasted from November 1, 2015 until January 31, 2016. The 2018 annual enrollment cycle was reduced to 45 days (in most states) from November 1, 2017 to December 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acting during the annual enrollment period is vital for any individual who wishes to buy individual health insurance.  During annual enrollment anyone who wants to purchase insurance through the public exchange has the opportunity to do so despite circumstances, such as health or age.  Outside of annual enrollment it can be difficult to obtain insurance, either public or private, unless circumstances dictate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eventusg.com/blog/affordable-care-act-open-enrollment Affordable Care Act - Open Enrollment] Eventus Solutions, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arrow diagramming method''' (ADM) is a network diagramming technique in which activities are represented by arrows.&lt;ref&gt;CPM in Construction – A Manual for General Contractors(Copyright 1965 by the Associated General Contractors of America)&lt;/ref&gt;  ADM is also known as the activity-on-arrow (AOA) method.  

==Usage==
ADM is used for scheduling activities in a [[project plan]].  Precedence relationships between activities are represented by circles connected by one or more arrows. The length of the arrow represents the duration of the relevant activity. ADM only shows finish-to-start relationships, meaning that each activity is completed before the successor activity starts.

Sometimes a "dummy task" is added, to represent a dependency between tasks, which does not represent any actual activity. The dummy task is added to indicate precedence that can't be expressed using only the actual activities. Such a dummy task often has a completion time of 0.

[[Image:Arrow Diagramming Method.png|500px|ADM example]]

Use of ADM as a common project management practice has declined with the adoption of computer-based scheduling tools.  In addition, the precedence diagram method (PDM), or activity-on-node (AON), is often favored over ADM.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 4th Edition: ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008 (copyright Project Management Institute, Inc. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

ADM network drawing technique the start and end of each node or event is connected to an arrow.

The start of the arrow comes out of a node while the tip of the arrow goes into a node. Between the two nodes lies an arrow that represents the activity. 

The event represented by the circular node consumes neither time nor resources. 

* A node is a specific, definable achievement in the project. 
* It has zero duration and consumes nil resources. 
* All activities that lead into a node must be completed before the activity lines following this node  can start.

'''Chiribiri''' was an aircraft and automobile manufacturer in [[Turin]] Italy from 1910-1929. '''Fabbrica Torinese Velivoli Chiribiri &amp; C.''', (Chiribiri Aircraft of Turin), was founded by the [[Venice|Venetian]] '''Antonio Chiribiri''', Maurizio Ramassotto and the engineer Gaudenzio Verga.

==History==
[[File:Chiribiri and Miller engine.jpg|thumb|240px|Antonio Chiribiri and a Miller aero-engine]]
Antonio 'Papa' Chiribiri was born in [[Venice]] in 1865 but it was not a natural city for engineering so he moved to [[Florence]] to work in a small factory.  He quickly moved on to [[Zust]] and then [[Isotta Fraschini]] as a technical specialist in automobiles. In 1909, he joined the aeronautical manufacturer [[Miller Aircraft]] in [[Turin]] and took charge of technical design.

==Aircraft==
In 1910, Antonio Chiribiri started his own company manufacturing spare parts and accessories for aeronautics, 'Fabrica Torinese Velivoli Chiribiri &amp; C'. The company became known for the quality of its aircraft parts and grew to build at least one aircraft, the 'Chiribiri No. 5', 2 seater, tractor [[monoplane]] which flew in July 1912. It was 24&amp;nbsp;feet (7.3&amp;nbsp;m) long with a 31&amp;nbsp;foot (9.4&amp;nbsp;m)wingspan, weighed 770&amp;nbsp;lb (350&amp;nbsp;kg) and flew at 55&amp;nbsp;mph (90&amp;nbsp;km/h).  But then Chiribiri was licensed to build 100 aeronautical motors for [[France|French]] engine manufacturer [[Gnome et Rhone]], so aircraft production ceased. This success enabled Chiribiri to open a ‘flying school’ at the factory, training pilots who subsequently flew in [[World War I]].

In 1912, a Fiat Chiribiri broke the world speed record for the timed kilometre from a flying start.  This car, with a 7,000 cc engine producing 300 [[horsepower|hp]] could reach {{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, is now displayed in the [[Mario Righini]] collection at the castle in [[Castelfranco Emilia|Panzano]], a [[frazione]] of [[Castelfranco Emilia]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righinimario.it/ Index.htm&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.righinimario.it&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cars==
[[File:Chiribiri típusú személygépkocsi. Fortepan 18503.jpg|thumb|Chiribiri four-seater, 1926]]

Chiribiri started building production [[automobile]]s in 1914, when [[Gustavo Brunetta d'Usseaux]], a rich land owner, commissioned the construction of 100 examples of the ‘Siva’, a 980 cc economy car, but the financial side failed so Chiribri carried on alone. In 1915 they started a second production series with a larger chassis and 1300 cc, 12&amp;nbsp;hp (9&amp;nbsp;kW) engine, and continued throughout the war.

At the 1919 [[Paris Motor Show]] Chiribiri launched the 'Milano' open bodied, 4 seater, 1593 cc, side valve, 12&amp;nbsp;hp model that remained in production until 1922 when it was replaced by the 100&amp;nbsp;km/h ‘Roma 5000’ (Touring and Sport versions) with a 1500 cc, twin overhead cam, engine producing 25 CV engine at 3,200 rpm. This was in turn developed into the 'Monza', either as a four-seater [[Torpedo (car)|torpedo]] bodied tourer or as a 'Monza Corsa' for competition, eventually with a supercharger.

===Motor Racing===
The racing debut of the Monza GT model in the hands of Ada Chiribiri, Amadeo Chiribiri, [[Tazio Nuvolari]], Gigi Platé and ''I'inglese Scalese'' 'the Englishman' [[Jack Scales]] (Jan 29 1886-Oct 23 1962)&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.autosport.com/showthread.php?s=bd676ed320f200c193cc3f491be7edcc&amp;threadid=64776&amp;pagenumber=3 The Nostalgia Forum at Atlas F1]&lt;/ref&gt; brought three victories in the [[Susa, Italy|Susa]]-[[Moncenisio (comune)|Moncenisio]] race, the [[Aosta]]-[[Great St Bernard Pass|Gran San Bernardo]] race and the [[Voiturette]] GP at the [[Monza]] autodrome.

In 1921 Amadeo Chiribiri, racing under the pseudonym of ''Deo'', won the 'Coppa della Cascine' in [[Florence]] and Mauro Ramassotto came second in the 2,000 cc class of the Rome Criterium.
[[File:Tuccimei in his Chiribiri at the 1922 Targa Florio.jpg|thumb|Mario Tuccimei with Chiribiri "Roma 5000" at Targa Florio 1922]] 
In the 1922 2nd [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] of [[Penya Rhin]] ([[Barcelona]]) at the [[Vilafranca del Penedès|Circuit de Vilafranca]], a road circuit in the hills behind [[Sitges]], Mauro Ramassotto finished 3rd and Amadeo Chiribiri set the fastest lap (112&amp;nbsp;km/h) for 'Voiturettes' up to 2000 cc.
 
In the 1923 3rd [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] of [[Penya Rhin]] ([[Barcelona]]) at the [[Vilafranca del Penedès|Circuit de Vilafranca]] [[Tazio Nuvolari]] was 5th in the 1500 cc Chiribiri, and in the II [[Spanish Grand Prix]] at the banked [[Sitges Terramar|Autodrom Sitges-Terramar]], he finished 4th.

In 1924, Alete Marconcini was Italian National Champion driving a Chiribiri 12/16 to 3 victories in the [[Mantua|Circuito di Belfiore]], the [[Cremona|Circuito di Cremona]] and the [[Coppa Montenero|Circuito del Montenero]]. Additionally Tazio Nuvolari won the Circuito del Savio and the Circuito del Polesine, whilst Rodolfo Caruso won the Coppa della Perugina.

In 1926 Piroli, the riding mechanic, was killed at the [[Avus]] in Berlin on 9 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/query.php?db=ct&amp;q=vehbrand&amp;n=Chiribiri Motorsport Memorial - Car and truck fatalities by vehicle brand&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.motorsportmemorial.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road cars===
In 1923 a road version was released with either a 45 [[horsepower|CV]] (33&amp;nbsp;kW) engine or a new 65 CV (48&amp;nbsp;kW) version using 5,000 rpm.  2 years later a supercharger was added, delivering 95 CV (70&amp;nbsp;kW) at 5,700 rpm, and achieving {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1927, the company diversified into diesel and industrial engines.

==Demise==
In 1925, the company was revamped and the name was changed to 'Auto Costruzioni Meccaniche Chiribiri' but sales of road going vehicles were never high, due in large part to the poor performance of the side-valve ''Milano'' whilst its higher 'aeronautical' engineering quality standards necessitated higher pricing. So, despite the 1927 venture into diesel and industrial engines, when financial depression hit Europe the company closed on 3 September 1929, its assets being sold to [[Lancia]].

==Family==
Antonio Chiribiri died in April 1943. Amedeo, his son born in 1898, and Ada his daughter, had been his closest collaborators and team members, having won races, hill climbs and rallies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">The term '''course of dealing''' is defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303 UCC § 1-303(b)]. "Course of dealing," as defined in subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a "[[course of performance]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cmt. 2, UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, according to the [[parol evidence rule]], words and terms in a writing intended to be the final expression of the agreement of the parties may not be contradicted by extrinsic evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement, extrinsic evidence in the form of course of dealing nonetheless may be used to explain or supplement the writing. An [[integration clause]] in a contract, stating that the parties intend the writing to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement does not suffice to negate the importance of course of dealing, "because these are such an integral part of the contract that they are not normally disclaimed by general language in the [[merger clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Allapattah Servs. v. Exxon Corp.'', 61 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1314 (S.D. Fla. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the common law, extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing could be considered only the written contract was ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;See, e,g, ''Pepcol Mfg. v. Denver Union Corp.'', 687 P.2d 1310, 1314 (Colo. 1984) ("It is only where the terms of an agreement are ambiguous or used in some special or technical sense not apparent from the contractual document itself that the court may look beyond the four corners of the agreement in order to determine the meaning intended by the parties.").&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, "Under the UCC, the lack of facial ambiguity in the contract language is basically irrelevant to whether extrinsic evidence ought to be considered by the court as an initial matter."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Amoco Prod. Co. v. W. Slope Gas Co.'', 754 F.2d 303, 307-08 (10th Cir. 1985). See also Cmt. 1(c), UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303: "This section definitely rejects the requirement that a condition precedent to the admissibility of the type of evidence specified in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the court that the language used is ambiguous.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of course of dealing will be disallowed, however, if it is "carefully negated" in the parties' contract by "specific and unequivocal" language.&lt;ref&gt;''Precision Fitness Equip., Inc. v. Nautilus, Inc.'', Civil Action No. 08-cv-01228-CMA-KLM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13576, at *25 (D. Colo. Feb. 2, 2011) (collecting cases). In that case the parties carefully negated course of dealing by including the following sentence in the Agreement: "Past practice and terms of dealing between [Nautilus] and [Precision], or in the industry generally, shall not be used to .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. interpret the terms of this Agreement."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term is usually used in US contract law, where the parties' course of dealing helps the court to understand the intention of the contracting parties, it is also used elsewhere in the law. In US patent law the term is used to help interpret the meaning of words used in patent claims by examining the prosecution history of a patent to determine what meaning the applicant and patent examiner understood claim words to have. It has been observed in the [[Federal Circuit]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The prosecution history often proves useful in determining a patent's scope, for it reveals the course of dealing with the Patent Office, which may show a particular meaning attached to the terms, or a position taken by the applicant to ensure that the patent would issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 52 F.3d 967, 991 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (concurring opinion of Mayer, J).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Electric utilities include [[Investor-owned utility|investor owned]], [[Public ownership|publicly owned]], [[cooperatives]], and [[nationalized]] entities. They may be engaged in all or only some aspects of the industry. [[Electricity market]]s are also considered electric utilities—these entities buy and sell electricity, acting as brokers, but usually do not own or operate generation, transmission, or distribution facilities. Utilities are regulated by local and national authorities.

Electric utilities are facing increasing demands &lt;ref name=one&gt;By Candace Lombardi, CNET. “[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10458148-54.html Utilities: Green tech good for planet, bad for business].” February 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Electrical grid#aging infrastructure|aging infrastructure]], reliability, and regulation.

==Organization==

===Power transactions===
An electric power system is a group of generation, transmission, distribution, communication, and other facilities that are physically connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity Basics|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcardell/Readings/uGrid/ElecPwrSys%20Operations/EPS_Overview_EIA.pdf|website=science.smith.edu|publisher=Smith College|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow of electricity within the system is maintained and controlled by dispatch centers which can buy and sell electricity based on system requirements.

===Executive compensation===
{{Globalize|date=February 2016}}

The [[executive compensation]] received by the executives in utility companies often receives the most scrutiny in the review of [[operating expenses]]. Just as regulated utilities and their governing bodies struggle to maintain a balance between keeping consumer costs reasonable and being profitable enough to attract investors, they must also compete with private companies for talented executives and then be able to retain those executives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joskow|first1=Paul|last2=Rose|first2=Nancy|last3=Wolfram|first3=Catherine|title=Political Constraints on Executive Compensation: Evidence From the Electric Utility Industry|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|date=1996|volume=27|issue=1|pages=165–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulated companies are less likely to use incentive-based [[remuneration]] in addition to base salaries. Executives in regulated electric utilities are less likely to be paid for their performance in bonuses or [[stock options]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They are less likely to approve compensation policies that include incentive-based pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The compensation for electric utility executives will be the lowest in regulated utilities that have an unfavorable regulatory environment. These companies have more political constraints than those in a favorable regulatory environment and are less likely to have a positive response to requests for rate increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=Stephen|last2=Hwang|first2=Leeseok|title=CEO Compensation In A Regulatory Environment: An Analysis Of The Electric Utility Industry|journal=Journal of Accounting, Auditing &amp; Finance|date=1997|volume=12|issue=3|pages=223–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as increased constraints from regulation drive compensation down for executives in electric utilities, [[deregulation]] has been shown to increase remuneration. The need to encourage risk-taking behavior in seeking new investment opportunities while keeping costs under control requires deregulated companies to offer performance-based incentives to their executives. It has been found that increased compensation is also more likely to attract executives experienced in working in competitive environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=Stephen|last2=Lee-Seok|first2=Hwang|last3=Lilien|first3=Steven|title=CEO Compensation After Deregulation: The Case Of Electric Utilities|journal=Journal of Business|date=2005|volume=78|issue=5|pages=1709–1752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] removed previous barriers to wholesale competition in the electric utility industry. Currently 24 states allow for deregulated electric utilities: Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deregulated States|url=http://www.alliedpowerservices.com/deregulated-states.shtml|website=alliedpowerservices.com|publisher=Allied Power Services|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As electric utility monopolies have been increasingly broken up into deregulated businesses, executive compensation has risen; particularly incentive compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arya|first1=Avinash|last2=Sun|first2=Huey-Lian|title=Impact of Deregulation in CEO Compensation: The Case of Electric Utilities|journal=American Business Review|date=2004|volume=22|issue=1|pages=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oversight'''

Oversight is typically carried out at the national level, however it varies depending on financial support and external influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gala.gre.ac.uk/3754/1/PSIRU_9253_-_2004-09-E-WEC.pdf|title=Electricity liberalisation: The beginning of the end|last=Thomas|first=Steve|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no existence of any influential international energy oversight organization. There does exist a World Energy Council, but its mission is mostly to advise and share new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldenergy.org/about-wec/mission-and-vision/|title=Mission|website=www.worldenergy.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not hold any kind of legislative or executive power. In the western hemisphere, many electric utility companies were under oversight from the United States and although the United States has, in the early 21st century, withdrawn from many of these countries. Several major energy utility companies are still under oversight from the United States.

'''[[Alternative energy]] promotion'''

Alternative energy has become more and more prevalent in recent times and as it is inherently independent of more traditional sources of energy, the market seems to have a very different structure. In the United States, to promote the production and development of alternative energies, there are many subsidies, rewards, and incentives that encourage companies to take up the challenge themselves. There is precedent for such a system working in countries like Nicaragua. In 2005, Nicaragua gave renewable energy companies tax and duty exemptions, which spurred a great deal of private investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24772123.html|title=Nicaragua’s latest revolution: Becoming a green energy powerhouse|newspaper=mcclatchydc|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success in Nicaragua may not be an easily replicated situation however. The movement was known as Energiewende and it is generally considered a failure for many reasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/renewable-energys-global-growing-pains/|title=Renewable energy’s global growing pains|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary reason was the fact that it was improperly timed and was proposed during a period in which their energy economy was under more competition.

'''Nuclear Energy'''

Nuclear energy may or may not be classified as a green source depending on the country. Although there used to be much more privatization in this energy sector, after the 2011 Fukushima district nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, there has been a move away from nuclear energy itself, especially for privately owned nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/nuclear-state-private-japan/|title=Nuclear power: private vs state|newspaper=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism being that privatization of companies tend to have the companies themselves cutting corners and costs for profits which has proven to be disastrous in the worst-case scenarios. This placed a strain on many other countries as many foreign governments felt pressured to close nuclear power plants in response to public concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nuclear energy however still holds a major part in many communities around the world.

== Customer expectations ==
Utilities have found that it isn't simple to meet the unique needs of individual customers, whether residential, corporate, industrial, government, military, or otherwise. Customers in the twenty-first century have new and urgent expectations that demand a transformation of the electric grid. They want a system that increases a utility's capacity to use solar and wind to produce electricity. Customers also want a system that gives them new tools, better data to help manage energy usage, advanced protections against cyberattacks, and a system that minimizes outage times and quickens power restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/source/11146-iei-event-emphasizes-efforts-utilities-serve-diverse-mix-customers/|title=IEI event emphasizes efforts by utilities to serve diverse mix of customers|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-08|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of International Employers''' / La Federación de Empresarios Internacionales (formerly The Federation of European Employers) was established in 1988 with the support of the European Commission. Today it operates independently and is the leading organisation for multinational [[employer]]s and is also known as FedEE 
Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/sme/federation-of-european-employers/ |title= Federation of European Employers |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation's principal aims are to assist companies to achieve legal compliance, operate more effectively at an international level, improve transnational HR capabilities, network with other international executives, develop practical/equitable pay structures, evaluate new employment methods and trends, monitor [[employee]] participation and [[trade union]] activities and embrace workforce diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing FedEE|url=http://www.fedee.com/fedee-global/|publisher=FedEE Global|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1988, the organisation was founded as the Federation of European Employers by current Secretary-General Robin E.J Chater in order to assist human resource professionals operating in Europe.

The head office was originally located in [[London]], UK - but with its relaunch in 2014 as a global organization the organization changed its operational headquarters to Bristol, UK and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cemea.economistconferences.com/content/robin-chater |title= Economist Conferences |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a further development in 2014, the Federation became the principal sponsor of a new business networking community called [[butN]]. The [[butN]] system allows business travelers to link up and meet face-to-face.

== Work of the Federation ==

In addition to providing legal information, updates and advice, the Federation compiles labour statistics and economic data, and creates policy checklists and model policies for service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.managers.org.uk/page/best-practice-healthy-workplace-healthy-workforce-guidance-managers |title= Best Practice: Healthy Workplace, Healthy Workforce - Guidance for Managers |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Areas of changes monitored by the Federation include: union developments (changes in structure, membership, campaigns, [[protest]]s and strike activity); evolution and operation of [[works councils]]; pay and benefit trends and new elements in [[collective agreements]]; remuneration; [[corporate governance]] rules and [[corporate ethics]]; income tax; health and safety; working time and leave; privacy at work; employee recruitment; work and residence permits; pensions and [[social security]]; financial participation plans; business transfers; termination of employment contracts; discrimination and [[equal opportunity]].

As an employers’ organisation, the Federation also acts as a [[think tank]] in a wide range of employment-related fields.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article3707143.ece |title = In the City: Edward Fennell |last = Fennell |first = Edward |date = 7 March 2013 |website = The Times |accessdate= 2 October 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando Fischmann''' is a scientist, businessman, biochemist and real estate developer, whose project is the Crystal Lagoons innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernandofischmann.com Fernando Fischmann official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fernando Fischmann was born in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. He attended the [[The Grange School, Santiago|Grange School]] in Santiago&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=71317 "I was alone in a period when no-one believed it could be done", ''El Mercurio'' (Santiago) on line, 24 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[University of Chile]], earning a graduate degree in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Business Week"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_17/b4225043254962.htm Nick Leiber, ''Fernando Fischmann's Power-Enabling Pools'', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' Magazine, 14 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered the estate agency business and began to invest in property, and in 1986 bought 60 hectares of land at the port of [[Algarrobo, Chile|Algarrobo]], on the coast of central Chile, with the plan to develop a holiday resort, now known as [[San Alfonso del Mar]], around an artificial crystalline lagoon. This led him to develop a new process for maintaining the purity and clarity of water in large volumes and low costs.&lt;ref name="Business Week" /&gt; The lagoon opened in December 2006.

He founded Crystal Lagoons Corp. in 2007, and his project San Alfonso del Mar won that year the Guinness Record as the world's largest Crystalline Lagoon and since then he has been internationally honored for his career as an innovator and ambassador of international business.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{when?|date=November 2018}} In 2016, he won The Stevie Award in its two categories: Innovator of the Year, for his sustainable vision for water usage, and for Innovation of the Year, for his water desalination technology that uses no energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevieawards.com/iba/management-awards-winners-1/ 2016 Management Awards Category Stevie Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the London Business School nominated Fischmann for its 2017 international innovation contest, the "Real Innovation Award".{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Financial regulation''' is a form of [[regulation]] or supervision, which subjects [[financial institution]]s to certain requirements, restrictions and guidelines, aiming to maintain the integrity of the financial system. This may be handled by either a [[government]] or non-government organization. Financial regulation has also influenced the structure of banking sectors by increasing the variety of financial products available. Financial regulation forms one of three legal categories which constitutes the content of [[financial law]], the other two being market practices, [[case law]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin 'Financial Law' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{More information|Financial history of the Dutch Republic}}
In the [[early modern period]], the Dutch were the pioneers in financial regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, Piet; James, Harold; Van der Wee, Herman (eds.): ''Financial Innovation, Regulation and Crises in History''. (Routledge, 2014. xiii + 176 pp. {{ISBN|9781848935044}})&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded ban (regulation) on [[short selling]] was enacted by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.

==Aims of regulation==
The objectives of financial regulators are usually:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.fsa.gov.uk/about/aims/statutory|title=UK FSA statutory objectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* market confidence – to maintain confidence in the financial system
* financial stability – contributing to the protection and enhancement of stability of the financial system
* consumer protection – securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers.

==Structure of supervision==
Acts empower organizations, government or non-government, to monitor activities and enforce actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |ssrn= 1994472 |title=What is Financial Regulation Trying to Achieve?, Riccardo De Caria}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various setups and combinations in place for the financial regulatory structure around the global.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.cssf.lu/nc/en/about-the-cssf/structure-organisation/|title=Luxembourg CSSF structure and organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.bafin.de/EN/Supervision/supervision_node.html|title= German BAFin supervision organisation|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120804111533/http://www.bafin.de/EN/Supervision/supervision_node.html|archivedate= 2012-08-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Supervision of stock exchanges===

===Supervision of listed companies===
Financial regulators ensure that listed companies and market participants comply with various regulations under the trading acts. The trading acts demands that listed companies publish regular financial reports, ad hoc notifications or directors' dealings. Whereas market participants are required to publish major shareholder notifications. The objective of monitoring compliance by listed companies with their disclosure requirements is to ensure that investors have access to essential and adequate information for making an informed assessment of listed companies and their securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.finanssivalvonta.fi/en/Supervision/Market_supervision/Disclosure/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Finland FSA supervion of listed companies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.cma.org.sa/En/AboutCMA/CMA_Department/Pages/Market_Supervision.aspx|title= Saudi Arabia market supervision|access-date= 2012-08-05|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130518194643/http://www.cma.org.sa/En/AboutCMA/CMA_Department/Pages/Market_Supervision.aspx|archive-date= 2013-05-18|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.borsaitaliana.it/azioni/documenti/informativa-societaria/informativasocietaria.en.htm|title= Borsa Italiana  listed stock supervision}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Number of countries having a banking crisis in each year since 1800.  This is based on ''This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly''
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com|title=This Time is Different - A Book by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff|first=Anchor Media|last=Works|publisher=reinhartandrogoff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers only 70 countries. The general upward trend might be attributed to many factors. One of these is a  gradual increase in the percent of people who receive money for their labor. The dramatic feature of this graph is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the [[Bretton Woods agreement]], 1945 to 1971. This analysis is similar to Figure 10.1 in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

=== Unique jurisdictions ===
In most cases, financial regulatory authorities regulate all financial activities. But in some cases, there are specific authorities to regulate each sector of the finance industry, mainly [[banking]], [[Security (finance)|securities]], [[insurance]] and [[pensions]] markets, but in some cases also commodities, futures, forwards, etc. For example, in [[Australia]], the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA) supervises banks and insurers, while the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) is responsible for enforcing financial services and corporations laws.

Sometimes more than one institution regulates and supervises the banking market, normally because, apart from regulatory authorities, central banks also regulate the banking industry. For example, in the USA banking is regulated by a lot of regulators, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[National Credit Union Administration]], the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], as well as regulators at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraction.gov/banking.shtml|work=State Banking Authorities |publisher=Consumer Action Website |title=list of state banking authorities |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the [[European System of Financial Supervision]] consists of the [[European Banking Authority]] (EBA), the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] (ESMA) and the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] (EIOPA) as well as the [[European Systemic Risk Board]]. The [[Eurozone]] countries are forming a [[Single Supervisory Mechanism]] under the [[European Central Bank]] as a prelude to [[Banking union]].

There are also associations of financial regulatory authorities. At the international level, there is the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO), the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]], the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], the [[Joint Forum]], and the [[Financial Stability Board]], where national authorities set standards through consensus-based decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2383445 |title=Varieties of Regulation: How States Pursue and Set International Financial Standards |last1=Prabhakar |first1=Rahul |date=1 June 2013 |publisher=Oxford University GEG |access-date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of financial regulation has changed significantly in the past two decades,{{When|date=February 2017}} as the legal and geographic boundaries between markets in banking, securities, and insurance have become increasingly "blurred" and [[globalization|globalized]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Regulatory reliance on credit rating agencies==
Think-tanks such as the [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] have argued that most European governments pushed dogmatically for the adoption of the [[Basel II]] recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in [[European Union law]] through the [[Capital Requirements Directive]] (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the [[European Central Bank]] itself e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of EU-based financial institutions, to rely more than ever on the standardized assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two private US agencies- Moody’s and S&amp;P, thus using [[public policy]] and ultimately taxpayers’ money to strengthen an anti-competitive duopolistic industry.

{{Redirect|Free enterprise}}
{{Capitalism}}
In [[economics]], a '''free market''' is an [[idealized cognitive model| idealized]] [[market (economics) |system]] in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the [[open market]] and by [[consumer]]s. In a free market the laws and forces of [[supply and demand]] are free from any intervention by a [[Forms of government| government]], by a price-setting monopoly, or by other authority. Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a [[regulated market]], in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods — such as [[tariff]]s — used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy. In an idealized [[free-market economy]], prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] without intervention by government policy.

Scholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a [[Coordinated market economy| coordinated market]] in fields of study such as [[political economy]], [[new institutional economics]], [[economic sociology]], and [[political science]]. All of these fields emphasize the importance in actually existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution.

Although free markets are commonly associated with [[capitalism]] within a [[market economy]] in contemporary usage and [[popular culture]], free markets have also been advocated by [[free-market anarchism| free-market anarchists]], [[market socialism |market socialists]], and some proponents of [[cooperative]]s and advocates of [[profit sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Bockman |first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2011 |month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant [[market power]], [[inequality of bargaining power]], or [[information asymmetry]] as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce more desirable social outcomes.

==Economic systems==

===Laissez-faire economics===
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
{{Main|Laissez-faire}}
The laissez-faire principle expresses a preference for an absence of non-market pressures on prices and wages, such as those from discriminatory government taxes, subsidies, [[tariff]]s, regulations of purely private behavior, or [[government-granted monopoly|government-granted]] or [[coercive monopoly|coercive monopolies]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued in ''The Pure Theory of Capital'' that the goal is the preservation of the unique information contained in the price itself.&lt;ref name="hayek_pure"&gt;''The Pure Theory of Capital'', F.A. Hayek, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of ''free market'' has been disputed and made complex by collectivist political philosophers and socialist economic ideas.&lt;ref name="Popper 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Open Society and Its Enemies| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=1994 |isbn= 978-0-415-61021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contention arose from the divergence from [[Classical economics|classical economists]] such as [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and from the continental [[Economics|economic science]] developed primarily by the Spanish scholastic and French classical economists, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]].

During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Poverty of Historicism| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=2002 |isbn= 0415278465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist economics===
{{Socialism sidebar}}

Various forms of [[socialism]] based on free markets have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of free markets include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], and the [[Ricardian socialist]]s. These economists believed that genuinely free markets and [[voluntary exchange]] could not exist within the [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] conditions of [[capitalism]].

These proposals ranged from various forms of [[worker cooperative]]s operating in a free market economy, such as the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] system proposed by Proudhon, to state-owned enterprises operating in unregulated and open markets. These models of socialism are not to be confused with other forms of market socialism (e.g. the [[Lange model]]) where publicly owned enterprises are coordinated by various degrees of [[economic planning]], or where capital good prices are determined through marginal cost pricing.

Advocates of free-market socialism such as [[Jaroslav Vanek]] argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek", interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved March 17, 2011: http://www.ru.org/51cooper.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits (based on the overall performance of their enterprise) in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.

Socialists also assert that free market capitalism leads to an excessively skewed distribution of income, which in turn leads to social instability. As a result, corrective measures in the form of [[social welfare]], re-distributive taxation, and administrative costs are required, which end up being paid into workers hands who spend and help the economy to run. They claim corporate monopolies run rampant in free markets, with endless agency over the consumer. Thus, free market socialism desires government regulation of markets to prevent social instability, although at the cost of taxpayer dollars.&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197–98)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoist economics===
As explained above, for classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] the term "free market" does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies, and artificial scarcities.&lt;ref name="Popper 1994"/&gt; This implies that [[economic rent]]s, i.e. profits generated from a lack of [[perfect competition]], must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.

Economic theory suggests the returns to [[land]] and other [[natural resource]]s are economic rents that cannot be reduced in such a way because of their perfect inelastic supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], [[The Wealth of Nations]] [[s:The Wealth of Nations/Book V/Chapter 2|Book V, Chapter 2]], Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses&lt;/ref&gt; Some economic thinkers emphasize the need to share those rents as an essential requirement for a well functioning market. It is suggested this would both eliminate the need for regular taxes that have a negative effect on trade (see [[deadweight loss]]) as well as release land and resources that are speculated upon or monopolised. Two features that improve the competition and free market mechanisms. [[Winston Churchill]] supported this view by his statement "Land is the mother of all monopoly".&lt;ref&gt;House Of Commons May 4th; King's Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The American economist and social philosopher [[Henry George]], the most famous proponent of this thesis, wanted to accomplish this through a high [[land value tax]] that replaces all other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Backhaus, "Henry George's Ingenious Tax," pp. 453–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of his ideas are often called [[Georgism|Georgists]] or Geoists and [[Geolibertarianism|Geolibertarians]].

[[Léon Walras]], one of the founders of the [[neoclassical economics]] who helped formulate the [[general equilibrium theory]], had a very similar view. He argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Additionally, income taxes could be eliminated because the state would receive income to finance public services through owning such resources and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 21|quote= For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-laissez-faire capitalist systems===
The stronger incentives to maximize productivity that Vanek conceives as possible in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises might be accomplished in a capitalistic free market if [[employee stock ownership plan|employee-owned companies]] were the norm, as envisioned by various thinkers including [[Louis O. Kelso]] and [[James S. Albus]].

==Concepts==

===Perfect competition and market failure===

Conditions that must exist for unregulated markets to behave as "free markets" are summarized at [[perfect competition]].  An absence of any of these perfect competition ideal conditions is a "[[market failure]]."  Most schools of economics allow that regulatory intervention may provide a substitute force to counter a market failure.  Under this thinking, this form of market regulation may be better than an unregulated market at providing a "free market."

===Supply and demand===
{{Main|Supply and demand}}
Demand for an item (such as goods or services) refers to the market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|producer surplus]]. Buyers willing to pay for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|consumer surplus]].&lt;ref name="Judd1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-1889(97)00010-9| title = Computational economics and economic theory: Substitutes or complements?| journal = [[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]| volume = 21| issue = 6| pages = 907–42| year = 1997| last1 = Judd | first1 = K. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell (supply) their labor for the highest price. The consumers are businesses, which try to buy (demand) the type of labor they need at the lowest price. As more people offer their labor in that market, the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left.&lt;ref name="Judd1997" /&gt;

In a free market, individuals and firms taking part in these transactions have the liberty to enter, leave and participate in the market as they so choose. Prices and quantities are allowed to adjust according to economic conditions in order to reach equilibrium and properly allocate resources. However, in many countries around the world, governments seek to intervene in the free market in order to achieve certain social or political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522012501/http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |archivedate=2014-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments may attempt to create [[social equality]] or [[equality of outcome]] by intervening in the market through actions such as imposing a [[minimum wage]] (price floor) or erecting [[price controls]] (price ceiling). Other lesser-known goals are also pursued, such as in the United States, where the federal government subsidizes owners of fertile land to not grow crops in order to prevent the supply curve from further shifting to the right and decreasing the equilibrium price. This is done under the justification of maintaining farmers' profits; due to the relative [[elasticity (economics)|inelasticity]] of demand for crops, increased supply would lower the price but not significantly increase quantity demanded, thus placing pressure on farmers to exit the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People Who Don't Farm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100962.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such interventions are often done in the name of maintaining basic assumptions of free markets, such as the idea that the costs of production must be included in the price of goods.  Pollution and depletion costs are sometimes NOT included in the cost of production (a manufacturer that withdraws water at one location then discharges it polluted downstream, avoiding the cost of treating the water), so governments may opt to impose regulations in an attempt to try to internalize all of the cost of production (and ultimately include them in the price of the goods).

Advocates of the free market contend that government intervention hampers economic growth by disrupting the natural allocation of resources according to supply and demand, while critics of the free market contend that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect a country's economy from better-developed and more influential economies, while providing the stability necessary for wise long-term investment.
[[Milton Friedman]] pointed to failures of [[central planning]], [[price controls]] and [[government-owned corporation|state-owned corporations]], particularly in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China#Economy|Communist China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/WSJ%20Whitehouse%20Article.pdf Ip, Greg and Mark Whitehouse, "How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets", ''Wall Street Journal Online'' (November 17, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ha-Joon Chang]] cites the examples of post-war Japan and the growth of South Korea's steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]", Ha-Joon Chang, Bloomsbury Press, {{ISBN|978-1596915985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic equilibrium===
{{Main|Economic equilibrium}}
[[General equilibrium theory]] has demonstrated, with varying degrees of mathematical rigor over time, that under certain conditions of [[Perfect Competition|competition]], the law of [[supply and demand]] predominates in this ideal free and competitive market, influencing prices toward an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] that balances the demands for the products against the supplies.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory of Value'', by [[Gérard Debreu]]&lt;/ref&gt; At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchaser's preference (or utility) for each product and within the relative limits of each buyer's [[purchasing power]]. This result is described as market efficiency, or more specifically a [[Pareto optimum]].

This equilibrating behavior of free markets requires certain assumptions about their agents, collectively known as [[perfect competition]], which therefore cannot be results of the market that they create. Among these assumptions are several which are impossible to fully achieve in a real market, such as complete information, interchangeable goods and services, and lack of market power. The question then is what approximations of these conditions guarantee approximations of market efficiency, and which failures in competition generate overall market failures. Several [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] have been awarded for analyses of market failures due to [[asymmetric information]].

===Low barriers to entry===
{{main|Barriers to entry}}
A free market does not require the existence of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, and in markets with low entry cost it is generally understood that competition flourishes in a free-market environment. It often suggests the presence of the [[profit motive]], although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All modern free markets are understood to include [[entrepreneur]]s, both individuals and [[business]]es. Typically, a modern free market economy would include other features, such as a [[stock exchange]] and a [[financial services]] sector, but they do not define it.

===Spontaneous order===
{{Main|Invisible hand|Spontaneous order}}
[[Friedrich Hayek]] popularized the view that market economies promote [[spontaneous order]] which results in a better "allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve."&lt;ref&gt;Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christina. ''Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment''. Routledge. 2001. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in market economies are characterized by the formation of complex transactional networks which produce and distribute goods and services throughout the economy. These networks are not designed, but nevertheless emerge as a result of decentralized individual economic decisions. The idea of spontaneous order is an elaboration on the [[invisible hand]] proposed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  Smith wrote that the individual who:

{{quote|By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest [an individual] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the [common] good.|Adam Smith, ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''}}

Smith pointed out that one does not get one's dinner by appealing to the brother-love of the butcher, the farmer or the baker. Rather one appeals to their self-interest, and pays them for their labor.

{{quote|It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.|Adam Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Adam | author-link = Adam Smith | title = Wealth of Nations | place = London | publisher = W.

Supporters of this view claim that spontaneous order is superior to any order that does not allow individuals to make their own choices of what to produce, what to buy, what to sell, and at what prices, due to the number and complexity of the factors involved. They further believe that any attempt to implement central planning will result in more disorder, or a less efficient production and distribution of goods and services.

Critics, such as political economist [[Karl Polanyi]], question whether a spontaneously ordered market can exist, completely free of "distortions" of political policy; claiming that even the ostensibly freest markets require a state to exercise coercive power in some areas – to enforce [[contract]]s, to govern the formation of [[labor union]]s, to spell out the rights and obligations of [[corporation]]s, to shape who has standing to bring legal actions, to define what constitutes an unacceptable [[conflict of interest]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer – and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class'' by [[Jacob S. Hacker]] and [[Paul Pierson]], Simon &amp; Schuster 2010, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===General principles===
[[The Heritage Foundation]], a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[think tank]], tried to identify the key factors necessary to measure the degree of freedom of economy of a particular country. In 1986 they introduced the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], which is based on some fifty variables. This and other similar indices do not ''define'' a free market, but measure the ''degree'' to which a modern economy is free, meaning in most cases, free of state intervention. The variables are divided into the following major groups:
* Trade policy,
* [[Fiscal burden of government]],
* Government intervention in the economy,
* Monetary policy,
* Capital flows and foreign investment,
* Banking and finance,
* Wages and prices,
* Property rights,
* Regulation, and
* Informal market activity.
These free market principles are what helped America transition to a free market economy. International free trade improved the country and in order for Americans to prosper from a strong economy they had no choice but to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 To The Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group is assigned a numerical value between 1 and 5; IEF is the arithmetical mean of the values, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Initially, countries which were traditionally considered capitalistic received high ratings, but the method improved over time. Some economists, like [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economists]] have argued that there is a direct relationship between economic growth and economic freedom, and some studies suggest this is true.&lt;ref name=CHICAGO&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/papers/Ayal_and_Karras.pdf Ayal, Eliezer B. and Karras, Georgios.

The principles of a free market are defined as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemarketprinciples.com/principles.php Principles of the Free Market] Free Market Monument Foundation, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individual Rights: "We are each created with equal individual rights to control and to defend our life, liberty and property and to voluntary contractual exchange."
# Limited Government: "Governments are instituted only to secure individual rights, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."
# Equal Justice Under Law: "Government must treat everyone equally; neither rewarding failure nor punishing success."
# Subsidiarity: "Government authority must reside at the lowest feasible level."
# Spontaneous Order: "When individual rights are respected, unregulated competition will maximize economic benefit for society by providing the most goods and services possible at the lowest cost."
# Property Rights: "Private ownership is the most efficient way to sustainably utilize resources."
# The Golden Rule: "Deal with others honestly and require honesty in return."

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Criticism of capitalism}}
Critics of the free market have argued that, in real world situations, it has proven to be susceptible to the development of [[price fixing]] monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tarbell|first= Ida |authorlink=Ida Tarbell|title= The History of the Standard Oil Company|publisher= McClure, Phillips and Co.|year= 1904|month= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reasoning has led to government intervention, e.g. the [[United States antitrust law]].

Two prominent Canadian authors argue that government at times has to intervene to ensure competition in large and important industries. [[Naomi Klein]] illustrates this roughly in her work ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' and [[John Ralston Saul]] more humorously illustrates this through various examples in ''The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World''.&lt;ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John"&gt;Saul, John ''The End of Globalism''.&lt;/ref&gt; While its supporters argue that only a free market can create healthy competition and therefore more business and reasonable prices, opponents say that a free market in its purest form may result in the opposite. According to Klein and Ralston, the merging of companies into giant corporations or the privatization of government-run industry and national assets often result in monopolies (or oligopolies) requiring government intervention to [[Competition law|force competition]] and reasonable prices.&lt;ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John"/&gt; Another form of market failure is [[speculation]], where transactions are made to profit from short term fluctuation, rather from the [[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]] of the companies or products.

This criticism has been challenged by historians such as [[Lawrence Reed]], who argued that monopolies have historically failed to form even in the absence of anti-trust law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fee.org/articles/41-rockefellers-standard-oil-company-proved-that-we-needed-anti-trust-laws-to-fight-such-market-monopolies/ "Cliche #41: “Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company Proved That We Needed Anti-Trust Laws to Fight Such Market Monopolies"], ''[[The Freeman]]'', January 23, 2015. Retrieved December 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because monopolies are inherently difficult to maintain: a company that tries to maintain its monopoly by buying out new competitors, for instance, is incentivizing newcomers to enter the market in hope of a buy-out.

American philosopher and author [[Cornel West]] has derisively termed what he perceives as [[dogma]]tic arguments for laissez-faire economic policies as "[[market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalism]]". West has contended that such mentality "trivializes the concern for public interest" and "makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit – often at the cost of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/cornel-west-democracy-matters/ "Cornel West: Democracy Matters"], ''[[The Globalist]]'', January 24, 2005. Retrieved October 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] contends that in the last 30 years the United States has moved beyond just having a market economy and has become a market society where literally everything is for sale, including aspects of social and civic life such as education, access to justice and political influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Sandel]] (June 2013). [http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_sandel_why_we_shouldn_t_trust_markets_with_our_civic_life Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life]. [[TED (conference)|TED]]. Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]] was highly critical of the idea of the market-based society in his book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'', noting that any attempt at its creation would undermine human society and the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Farrell (July 18, 2014). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/07/18/the-free-market-is-an-impossible-utopia/ The free market is an impossible utopia]. ''[[The Washington Post]].'' Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of free market economics range from those who reject markets entirely in favour of a [[planned economy]] as advocated by various [[Marxism|Marxists]], to those who wish to see market failures regulated to various degrees or supplemented by government interventions. [[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] support market roles for government, such as using fiscal policy for economic stimulus when actions in the private sector lead to sub-optimal economic outcomes of [[depression (economics)|depressions]] or [[recession]]s. Business cycle theory is used by Keynesians to explain ''[[liquidity trap]]s'', by which underconsumption occurs, to argue for government intervention with fiscal policy.

Some would argue, only one known example of a true free market exists, which is the [[black market]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The black market is under constant threat by the [[police]], but under no circumstances do the police regulate the substances that are being created. The black market produces wholly unregulated goods, and are purchased and consumed unregulated. That is to say, anyone can produce anything at any time, and anyone can purchase anything available at any time. The alternative view is that the black market is not a free market at all since high prices and monopolies are often enforced through murder, theft and destruction. Black markets can only exist peripheral to regulated markets where laws are being regularly enforced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6286">'''Harrison King McCann''' (November 4, 1880 &amp;ndash; December 20, 1962), was the founder of the H. K. McCann Company.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; H. K. McCann Company was an advertising agency that, as [[McCann Erickson]], grew to become the world’s largest with a global network of offices in more than 130 countries, providing advertising campaigns for brands including [[Standard Oil]] (Esso, Exxon), [[Vaseline]], [[Beech-Nut]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], [[Nabisco]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[General Motors]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[L’Oréal]], [[Bacardi]], [[Nestlé]] and [[MasterCard]].&lt;ref name=adageprofile&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-the-advertising-century/harrison-king-mccann/140240/ |title=Harrison King McCann |publisher=''AdAge'' |date=March 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

McCann was born in Maine on November 4, 1880 to a New England family that had settled in New Hampshire in the seventeenth century.
In 1902 he graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], where he had worked on the student newspaper and been leader of the mandolin club.

During his high school and college years he worked for Hiram Ricker &amp; Sons, hotel proprietors in Poland Spring, initially as a bellboy and later as salesman for [[Poland Spring]] water. This job took him to the Poland Springs New York office.

Once in New York, McCann switched jobs, joining the Amsterdam Advertising Agency as copywriter in 1903. In the same year he was offered a position by the [[New York Telephone Company]], and put in charge of an experimental campaign to discover if advertising could prevent the company from losing customers to smaller competitors. By 1910, McCann was successfully running an in-house department of 100 staff.

McCann’s work for the New York Telephone Company attracted the attention of the Standard Oil Company, who recruited him to lead their in-house advertising department.  When the US Government ordered the break-up of the Standard Oil Company on monopoly grounds, McCann formed his own agency with Canadian efficiency expert Herbert Newton Casson to provide ad continuity.

The H. K. McCann Company opened its doors on Broadway, New York in 1912, with Standard Oil as its first account. By its second year it was handling over $200,000 worth of business. A network of offices across North America quickly followed. In 1928, McCann opened its first European offices in Berlin, London and Paris. In 1930, McCann merged with Alfred Erickson’s agency to form McCann-Erickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Harrison McCann died on December 20, 1962 in a car crash in [[Old Westbury, New York]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Harrison King McCann, Wife Are Killed in Long Island Crash |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/12/22/archives/harrison-king-mccann-wife-are-killed-in-long-island-crash.html |quote=Harrison King McCann, honorary board chairman and former president of the McCann-Erickson advertising agency in New York, and his wife, Dorothy, were killed today in an automobile accident here. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 22, 1962 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Ad Agency Founder Dies in Car Crash |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8bBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OQEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2603,1516302&amp;dq=mccann+advertising&amp;hl=en |quote= |newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=December 21, 1962 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== McCann and the number thirteen ==

While [[triskaidekaphobia]] – fear of the number 13 – is a common, if usually mild phobia in the US, McCann felt that it was his lucky number.

He had begun his job with the New York Telephone Company on October 13, 1910, he made the decision to form his own agency on November 13, 1911, and he went on to weave the number into the lore of the agency. He often shortened the company name to The H K McCann Co to have the right number of letters. The agency’s famous and still used credo "Truth Well Told" also contains 13 letters, and whenever his growing agency moved to new buildings, McCann would insist on a thirteenth floor office.

When McCann-Erickson moved to the newly built 50 Rockefeller Plaza in 1939 he demanded a 13th floor, and placed his office on it. It remains the only building in the [[Rockefeller Center]] to have one.

== Legacy ==

As a distinguished [[Bowdoin College]] alumnus, Harrison King McCann is the namesake of a named professorial chair in the college's English department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/namedprofessorsh00bowd/namedprofessorsh00bowd_djvu.txt Named professorships at Bowdoin College (Bowdoin College Bulletin, no. 399) (1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bowdoin professors endowed with this honor in more recent years include:

{{nihongo|'''''Kachō Kōsaku Shima'''''|課長島耕作|lead=yes}} is the first in a number of [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series, by [[Kenshi Hirokane]], about a fictional [[salaryman]] named Kōsaku Shima. The series ran from 1983–1992 under this title, winning the 1991 [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the General category.&lt;ref name="KodanshaHahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |author=Joel Hahn |title=Kodansha Manga Awards |work=Comic Book Awards Almanac |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121042032/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the series has sold over 40 million copies in Japan.&lt;ref name=83debut&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mantan-web.jp/2013/07/11/20130710dog00m200067000c.html | script-title=ja:島耕作 ： 社長退任で「会長編」へ　連載30年節目に | date=July 11, 2013 |work=Mainichi Shimbun Digital | language=Japanese |accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts the life of a [[salaryman]], a Japanese [[white-collar worker]] who devotes his life to his company. The manga has also been published as 7 bilingual volumes (Japanese-English) called ''Division Chief Kosaku Shima''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541567.Division_Chief_Kosaku_Shima_Kodansha_Bilingual_Comics_Volume_5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''President Kosaku Shima'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/President-Kosaku-Bilingual-English-Japanese/dp/4770041322/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490637923&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=President+Kosaku+Shima&lt;/ref&gt; and in French and German.  In addition to various manga there has also been one comedic ONA, and two comedic anime adaptations lasting 11 episodes each, a live action film, and a single episode TV drama. The character also acts as the "host" or framing device for a business documentary series on [[NHK World]], ''Shima Kosaku's Asian Entrepreneurs''.

At the start of the long-running series, Shima Kōsaku is a ''kachō'', or section chief, of a huge conglomerate, Hatsushiba Electric. He is later promoted to ''buchō'' (division chief) and eventually promoted to manager and executive-director, and with each promotion the title of the series changed as well. He was promoted to the president of Hatsushiba Electric, and the title changed to "Shachō" Shima Kōsaku, which means "President Kōsaku Shima". The fictional conglomerate is modeled after [[Panasonic]], or Matsushita Electric, where Hirokane worked before and is highly accurate in its portrayal of Japanese corporate culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3574">[[File:Marian Dąbrowski dziennikarz (cropped).jpg|thumb|Marian Dąbrowski in 1932]]'''Marian Dąbrowski''' (September 27, 1878 in [[Mielec]] – September 27, 1958 in [[Miami]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] journalist, entrepreneur and publisher, the biggest and the most influential press magnate of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. 

Between 1903 and 1907 he studied Polish philology at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]]. Then took up the job of a teacher, but quit and began working as a secretary of the ''Ilustracja Polska'' magazine. In 1908 he became a journalist in the ''Glos Narodu'' magazine, two years later he founded his own newspaper, [[Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny]] (''Illustrated Daily Courier''). First issu of the ''IKC'' was printed on December 18, 1910, after a few years its circulation grew to 180 000. 

In 1918, after [[World War I]], Dabrowski started creating his own press empire, opening offices in several locations of the interbellum Poland. In 1927 he purchased the ''Nowa Reforma'' magazine and moved his business to a lavish building called ''Palac Prasy'' (''Palace of the Press''), located at 1 Wielopole Street in Krakow. In 1932 his company was worth some $1.5 mln, he employed around 1400 people and published 5 titles, including the flagship, ''Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny''. 

Between 1921 and 1935 Dabrowski was member of the [[Sejm|Polish Parliament]], as a member of the [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] (''PSL Piast'') and later, the [[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Since 1926 he supported the [[Sanacja]], also was alderman of the city of Krakow. Dabrowski often helped those in need, he funded prizes for young painters, also financially supported construction of a new building of the National Museum of Poland. He came up with the idea of opening the ''Bagatela'' Theatre, also sponsored field works around the [[Krakus Mound]].

For many years, Dabrowski was a member of Krakow's [[Association of Friends of Fine Arts]], between 1935 and 1939 he was director of this organization. He supported development of sports, organizing various competitions. Also, he popularized the [[Tatra Mountains]], for which he was named honorary citizen of [[Zakopane]].

Just before [[World War II]], Dabrowski left Poland for [[France]]. The war turned out a catastrophe for his business. His savings quickly dried out, and he moved to [[Florida]], where lived in poverty, forgotten and destitute. He died on the day of his 80th birthday, after several years urn with his ashes was brought to Krakow and buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery.

'''Metro Center''' is the original colonial settlement of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], located beside a bend in the [[Connecticut River]]. As of 2011, Metro Center features a majority of [[Western Massachusetts]]' most important cultural, business, and civic venues.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman/Volk Associates, [http://www.mass.gov/Asfcb/docs/downtown_springfield_residential.pdf Residential Market Potential, Downtown Springfield], for City of Springfield, December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Metro Center includes Springfield's Central Business District, its [[Club Quarter]], its [[Springfield Municipal Group|government center]], its convention headquarters, and in recent years, it has become an increasingly popular residential district, especially among young professionals, empty-nesters, and creative types, with a population of approximately 7,000 (2010.)

As of 2011, Metro Center includes approximately 690 acres of land where the city was initially established, aligned north–south, following the Connecticut River, and is bounded by [[Route 291]] to the north, Union and Howard Streets to the south, Federal Street to the east and the Connecticut River to the west, although Metro Center is physically separated from the Connecticut River by [[Interstate 91]] – a 1958 urban renewal project that separated the city from its riverfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-91_MA/|title=Interstate 91-Massachusetts|website=www.bostonroads.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/neighborhood-metro.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Metro Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014841/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/neighborhood-metro.0.html |date=2011-10-05 }}. Springfieldcityhall.com (2010-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement and early history==
Metro Center, founded in 1636 by [[William Pynchon]] and a group of pioneers, was originally called ''Agawam Plantation''. At the time of its founding, Agawam Plantation was the northernmost settlement on the Connecticut River, and belonged to the [[Connecticut Colony]] as opposed to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], to which it would later belong. Within less than a decade after its founding in 1636, differences arose between the leaders of Agawam (Springfield) and Newtown (Hartford) over how to treat the region's Native population. Springfield hoped to pursue peaceful relations with the Natives so as to better facilitate trade and communal farming, whereas Hartford – and many of Connecticut's early settlers – had fought the bloody [[Pequot War]] to claim their territory, and thus took a more skeptical view of the Native population. This difference of opinion led to Agawam (Springfield) annexing itself to Massachusetts in 1640. At that time, William Pynchon was named magistrate of the settlement, and the town's name was changed to Springfield in Pynchon's honor. (Pynchon was from [[Springfield, Essex]].)&lt;ref name=Zimmerman/&gt;

Metro Center Springfield was founded on the Connecticut River, just north of the River's first falls unnavigable by seagoing vessels, (the [[Enfield Falls]].) Thus, in founding Springfield, the business-minded Pynchon assured that all northern river trade and travel ran through Springfield. In early colonial days, Springfield was the dominant trading post on the Connecticut River.

In 1675, during King Philip's War. the Metacomet-led [[Attack on Springfield]] burned over 75% of Springfield, which was only Metro Center, including the saw and grist mills. Following King Philip's War, thought was given to abandoning the settlement at Springfield; however, luckily, cooler heads prevailed and the settlement remained.

In 1777, noting Springfield's location on a major U.S. river, fertile farmland, and close proximity to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] founded the U.S. National [[Arsenal at Springfield]] on a tall bluff overlooking Metro Center. Subsequently, Springfield developed neighborhoods other than Metro Center.

In 1813, the green in the middle of Metro Center was officially named [[Court Square]]. Court Square had been the center of public and social life since the times when Native Americans roamed freely through Springfield's streets (pre-King Philip's War,) and continued to be so until the building of Springfield's first train station in the 1830s.

The arrival of the railroad to Springfield in the 1830s brought great wealth to the city, again, due to its location. Goods from New York, Boston, Chicago, and even as far west as San Francisco travelled through Springfield on their ways to coastal distribution centers. Springfield, rather than Hartford, or Northampton, or Greenfield, became Western New England's railroad hub, perhaps due to the presence of the [[Springfield Armory]], but more likely due to the city's growing reputation for ingenuity, and that it served as a nearly equidistant point between Albany and Boston, Providence, and New York.

==Culture==
Metro Center features the majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural institutions. For example, it features the [[Springfield Armory]] [[National Park]], which includes a museum featuring the world's largest historic firearm collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/spar/index.htm Springfield Armory National Historic Site – Springfield Armory National Historic Site]. Nps.gov (2013-08-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; A block west of the Armory is the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]], which includes an extraordinary grouping of world-class and regional museums, each with a different focus. The Quadrangle features the George Walter Vincent Smith Museum, which is known worldwide for having the largest collection of Chinese cloisonné outside of China. It also features the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a particularly strong European [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] collection, including paintings by Monet, Degas, and Gauguin, among others. The American Collection features works by Springfielder [[James McNeill Whistler]]. The Springfield Science Museum features the first-ever American [[planetarium]] (built 1937,) Dinosaur Hall, and a live animal center. The Quadrangle's two regional museums are the [[Connecticut River Valley]] History Museum, the most extensive compilation of information on the historic valley and its people; and the new Wood Museum of Springfield History, which showcases Springfield as ''The City of Firsts'' in the context of American History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/ Springfield Museums].

===Live entertainment near Court Square===
[[Symphony Hall, Springfield|Springfield Symphony Hall]] at Court Square features famously "perfect acoustics," and frequent performances by the innovative [[Springfield Symphony Orchestra]]. It also features traveling performances of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows. Also, close by, the Community Music School of Springfield, located at 127 State Street, features musical programs during the day and evenings. Across the street, the [[MassMutual Center]] features arena-scale rock concerts, conventions, and is home to Springfield's professional sports team, the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Springfield Thunderbirds]].

Within close walking distance are Rascal's, a comedy club at 1 Monarch Place, and Springfield's famous City Stage playhouse – a tiny modern playhouse that produces a range of works from philosophical modern plays, to Shakespeare, to children's entertainment. If you plan an excursion to City Stage, it is best to check ahead to see if what's showing meets your tastes.

===The Club Quarter===
{{main|Club Quarter}}

The area surrounding [[Stearns Square]] has been Springfield' Club Quarter for over 120 years. As of 2011, Springfield's [[Club Quarter]] continues to expand, now featuring over 70 clubs, bars, restaurants, and even historic gathering places. For an example of the latter, the [[Duryea brothers]] built the first American gasoline-powered car at a still existent building on Taylor Street – one of the few buildings in the district at that time, which was not a bar or club. An 1893 model Duryea stands in a small park outside of what is today Alumni Club at 90 Worthington Street, mere feet from the historically important Duryea shop. Springfield's most popular bars and clubs are an eclectic mix, featuring Skyplex, a three-level bar and club directly on Stearns Square; Theodore's – voted America's best blues club; Oz, one of Springfield's five [[LGBT]] clubs and bars, (not counting the numerous clubs and bars that sponsor LGBT nights;) Shekago's, a martini bar featuring live jazz and piano-playing; and Fat Cat's Bar &amp; Grill, which features punk, industrial, and other live rock bands. In Springfield's Club Quarter, many different "scenes" co-mingle peaceably, including hip-hop, rock, LGBT, jazz, strip clubs for both men and women, and blues.

The restaurants and clubs by the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] also feature live music (Pizzeria Uno's, Mama Iguana's,) Las Vegas-style shows (Pazzo's,) and of course, several sports bars, such as Samuel's and Max's Tavern.

===Urban fabric===
Even by urban [[New England]] standards, where downtowns are frequently [[walkable]] like those in Europe, Springfield's is exceptionally so. {{citation needed|reason=No sources.|date=November 2015}}It is composed of mixed-use residential, commercial, and institutional organizations. A majority of its buildings were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, giving it a Victorian look; however, there are numerous skyscrapers as well. Metro Center is cut off from the Connecticut Riverfront by Interstate 91, an 8-lane highway. Across Interstate 91 sits the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] complex, Springfield's largest tourist draw.

====Legislature skyline height limit====
From 1908 until 1971, Springfield was subject to a skyline height limit – imposed by the Massachusetts State Legislature – of 125 feet, and thus Springfield has a relatively lower skyline than comparable cities of its population and economic and cultural importance. This trait is now looked on as a positive by developers at the Urban Land Institute, who have written "Metro Center now stands out from its peers, most of which long ago demolished the human-scale architecture that made their downtowns livable."  During Springfield's resurgence in the new millennium, prominent architects – like [[Moshe Safdie]], who built the $57 million, 2008 U.S. Federal Court Building; [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates]], who built the $47 million, 2004 Basketball Hall of Fame; and [[TRO Jung Brannen]], who are building the $110 million, 2012 [[adaptive reuse]] of Springfield's original Technical High School – adapted to Springfield's human-scale to a create monumental buildings rather than attempting to "achieve monumentalism through over-scaling," as has happened in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10708|title=WAN:: United States Federal Courthouse by Safdie Architects in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States|website=www.worldarchitecturenews.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transportation====
In 2012, Springfield's 1926 Union Station will receive a $75 million renovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/rfqs/Union_Station_In_the_News/04-10-11-Project_Hops.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (including $4 million pledged by [[Connecticut]]) to become an intermodal transportation center, with [[Peter Pan Bus]]' headquarters, [[PVTA]]'s headquarters, and [[Greyhound]] all relocating to the new facility. This project will coincide with the start-up of Springfield's two new rail lines: the $1 billion, southbound [[Springfield Hartford New Haven rail line]], which will reportedly reach speeds up to 110&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt Conn. seeks funds for rail work on Hartford-to-Springfield line (document)- The New Haven Register – Serving New Haven, Connecticut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419101014/http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt |date=2012-04-19 }}.

Ultimately, this renovation of the old Montrealer line will take passengers to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhhsrail.com/ New Haven – Hartford – Springfield Rail Project].

While billions of dollars are funding Springfield's north–south rail expansion, a more modest, combined $25 million recently improved Springfield's two main thoroughfares, Main Street and State Street. Both now feature artistic crosswalks and ornate streetlights, which add to the eclectic and increasingly whimsical atmosphere of Metro Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/247.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Transportation and Infrastructure Improvements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716062525/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/247.0.html |date=2011-07-16 }}.

====Interstate 91's placement inhibiting economic growth====
Metro Center provides quick access to [[Interstate 91|I-91]] and [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], both of which connect to [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (the Massachusetts Turnpike), making trips to [[Boston]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Hartford]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] convenient by car. This convenience, however, came at a steep price to Springfielders: hasty, poor urban planning decisions during 1958 created the now elevated I-91 viaduct along the Connecticut River, which essentially cut off Springfield from the Connecticut, the parks surrounding it, and the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] complex, preventing foot traffic and resulting in untold losses of tourist dollars among other losses.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=larp_grad_research&amp;sei-redir=1#search="91+north+end+umass+cut+off"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/1200_Hall_of_Fame_Building_Plans/Springfield_TAP_Presentation_FINAL_diagrams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Boston's [[Urban Land Institute]] proposed a vision for Springfield's riverfront; however, as of 2011, Interstate 91 remains a physical barrier between Springfield, the Connecticut River, and the Basketball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922000633/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront.0.html |date=2011-09-22 }}. Springfieldcityhall.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of I-91 and its blockage of the Connecticut River – along with the cement covering of the Mill River – are challenges that Springfield officials say they plan on addressing in upcoming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/big_dig-springfield_i-91_in_ci.html|title=Big Dig-Springfield? I-91 in city needs major rehab that could turn into a reimagining|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent academic papers have documented negative economic and sociological effects of I-91's placement in Springfield – it has fragmented three neighborhoods, inhibited the economic growth of Springfield's most valuable land – on the Riverfront and around the Basketball Hall of Fame – and essentially made the river inaccessible to people as a place for recreation and tourism. Recent city planning polls rate Springfield's I-91 among the worst urban planning decisions made by an American city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanplanet.org/forums/index.php/topic/24879-best-worst-use-of-waterfront/ Best / Worst use of waterfront – USA Northeast]. UrbanPlanet. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The highway's inhibiting effects on riverfront development were exacerbated during the 1980s and 1990s, when giant, above-grade highway parking lots were built underneath I-91, and later when earthen, grassy mounds and 20-foot limestone walls were constructed around large sections of it, blocking all but the tallest Metro Center buildings' views of the Connecticut River, and discouraging economic and social interaction between Metro Center and the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].

==Buildings==

===Residential real estate===
Metro Center's housing stock was, for centuries, Springfield's most prized. As of 2011, it is fast regaining that status among people attracted to urban living without the expense – bohemians, artists, empty-nesters, and LGBT residents have constituted the first wave of Metro Center's recolonization, which began only during the new millennium. Housing stock consists of various architectural styles, from detached Victorian houses and attached red-brick row-houses in the [[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]], to historic buildings adaptively re-used or renovated into condominiums, artists' lofts, and rental properties in the [[Apremont Triangle Historic District]]. Notable examples include a former 4-star [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel, ([[The Kimball Towers]];) a famous, Victorian high school (Classical High School Condominiums;) an architecturally significant factory (The McIntosh;) and a renovated [[art deco]] apartment building, (Pearl Street Luxury Condos.) Rental properties include the adaptive re-use of the former [[Milton Bradley]] toy factory, now called Stockbridge Court, as well as the adaptive re-use of the former YMCA building, 122 Chestnut Street. Major construction projects like the $101 million adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School for Massachusetts' Data Center;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/demolition_of_springfield_tech_high_school.html Demolition of former Springfield Tech High School under way (photos and video)]. masslive.com.

The '''[[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]]''' is one of the few neighborhoods in the [[Knowledge Corridor]] that remains lined with historic, restored red-brick Victorian row houses on both sides, and shaded by tree canopies. The Mattoon Street neighborhood features some of Springfield's most prestigious residential addresses, on Mattoon Street, Salem Street, Elliot Street, and others. It also features one of renowned architect [[H.H. Richardson]]'s first works in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, the current Hispanic Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=457 North Congregational Church, Springfield (1873) | Historic Buildings of Massachusetts].

===Civic===
Metro Center features Springfield's and Western Massachusetts' most prominent civic institutions, including the [[Greek Revival]] Springfield City Hall, the Springfield School Board, the Hampden County Courthouse and [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] Juvenile Courthouse, designed by [[H.H. Richardson]] himself. Springfield's ornate, neo-classical [[Springfield Municipal Group]], dedicated by U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]], features a 300&amp;nbsp;ft. tall [[Italianate]] [[campanile]] that towers over Court Square. Other prominent civic buildings include "starchitect" [[Moshe Safdie]]'s new, $57 million, architecturally award-winning Federal Courthouse on State Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msafdie.com/#/projects/unitedstatesfederalcourthouse_springfield|title=Safdie Architects|website=www.msafdie.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Massachusetts' new $110 million Data Center, an adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/demolition_of_springfield_tech_high_school.html/ Springfield, Massachusetts].

===Libraries, colleges, and universities===
The City of Springfield's palatial Public Library is located in Metro Center. It features the second largest library circulation in [[New England]] (behind [[Boston]]'s.) Metro Center also features three higher learning institutions: [[Cambridge College]] at Tower Square, the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]'s Urban Design Center at Court Square, and [[Springfield Technical Community College]], which enrolls over 6500 students.

===Corporate and professional===
Metro Center is the central business district of [[Western Massachusetts]], featuring numerous international, national, regional, and local businesses and headquarters. 17,000 businesspeople work in Metro Center. Businesses include the [[Fortune 100]] [[MassMutual]] Financial, [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Hampden Bank]], NuVo Bank, [[Merriam Webster]], [[Liberty Mutual]], [[Verizon]], the [[American Hockey League]], the Northeastern headquarters of [[TD Banknorth]], [[Health New England]], Peoples' United Bank, United Personnel staffing, numerous attorneys, architects, accountants, other professionals, and hundreds of businesses.

===Hotels===
Metro Center features several 3 star and 4 star hotels, including the Springfield Marriott Hotel; the Springfield Sheraton Monarch Place Hotel; the Hilton Garden Inn Springfield; and currently under construction (as of 2011) the former Epiphany Tower on State Street across from the [[MassMutual Center]] will become a 98-bed [[Holiday Inn Express]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/04/springfield_redevelopment_auth_1.html Springfield Redevelopment Authority OKs plans for Holiday Inn Express at former Epiphany Tower]. masslive.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks===
Metro Center features seven prominent parks: [[Court Square]], the city's one constant topographical feature since its founding in 1636; [[Stearns Square]], designed by the creative "dream-team" of [[Stanford White]] and [[August St. Gaudens]], then as now in the heart of Springfield's [[Club Quarter]]; Tower Square Park, a green park atop a skyscraper in downtown Springfield; Center Square on Main Street, a well-landscaped park that borders the Club Quarter and Downtown Central Business District; Merrick Park, by the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]], the sole function of which is to exhibit [[Augustus St. Gaudens]]' most famous outdoor bronze sculpture, ''[[The Puritan]]''; Pynchon Park, a [[modernist]] concrete park with trees and a distinctive elevator in the [[brutalist]] architectural style – one of the more original looking city parks in the United States, arguably; and [[Connecticut River Walk Park]], a walkway and bikeway that was devastated by the [[2011 New England tornado outbreak#The Greater Springfield tornado|2011 Greater Springfield tornado]], and which previous to it, was rarely used due to [[Interstate 91]] physically blocking Springfielders' access to it. Regardless, if one can make it there, it affords beautiful views of the river, valley, skyline, and mountains surrounding them all.

Retrieved on 4 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was keen on giving him a religious and political education from an early age; at the age of four he started attending the Qur'anic school at the Royal Palace.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Mohammed completed his first primary and secondary studies at Royal College and attained his [[Bachelor's degree|Baccalaureate]] in 1981, before gaining a [[bachelor's degree]] in law at the [[Mohammed V University at Agdal]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/biography-hm-king-mohammed-vi "Biography of  HM.

He served as the Coordinator of the Offices and Services of the Royal Armed Forces until 1994.&lt;ref name="royalark.net"/&gt;

In 1987, Mohammed obtained his first ''Certificat d'Études Supérieures'' (CES) in political sciences, and in July 1988 he obtained a ''Diplôme d'Études Approfondies'' ([[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]]) in public law.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt; In November 1988, he trained in [[Brussels]] with [[Jacques Delors]], then-President of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Mohammed obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in law [[Latin honours|with distinction]] on 29 October 1993 from the French [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]] for his thesis on "[[EEC]]-[[Maghreb]] Relations".&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt; On 12 July 1994, he was promoted to the military rank of [[Major General]], and that same year he became President of the High Council of Culture and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Royal Moroccan Army.

Shortly after he took the throne, Mohammed VI addressed his nation via television, promising to take on poverty and corruption, while creating jobs and improving [[human rights in Morocco|Morocco's human rights]] record. Mohammed's reformist rhetoric was opposed by [[Islamist]] conservatives, and some of his reforms angered [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. In February 2004, he enacted a new family code, or [[Mudawana]], which granted women more power.&lt;ref name="BBCProfile"/&gt;

Mohammed also created the so-called [[Equity and Reconciliation Commission (Morocco)|Instance Equité et Réconciliation]] (IER), which was tasked with researching [[human rights violation]]s under Hassan II. This move was welcomed by many as promoting [[democracy]], but was also criticized because reports of human rights violations could not name the perpetrators. According to human rights organisations, widespread abuses still exist in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/01/international/africa/01morocco.html?pagewanted=print|title=In Morocco, a Rights Movement, at the King's Pace|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2010|first=Neil|last=MacFarquhar|date=1 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4457267.stm|title=Facing up to Morocco's hidden fear |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 February 2010|date=19 April 2005|first=Pascale|last=Harter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=80256DD400782B8480256F6A003CF643|title=Morocco/Western Sahara: Amnesty International welcomes public hearings into past violations|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Moroccan protests]] were motivated by corruption and general political discontentment, as well as by the hardships of the [[late 2000s recession|global economic crisis]].

In a speech delivered on 9 March 2011, the King said that parliament would receive "new powers that enable it to discharge its representative, legislative, and regulatory mission". In addition, the powers of the judiciary were granted greater independence from the King, who announced that he was impaneling a committee of legal scholars to produce a draft constitution by June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525003606/http://moroccansforchange.com/2011/03/09/king-mohamed-vi-speech-3911-full-text-feb20-khitab/ Mohammed VI speech].

=== Allegations of corruption ===
Royal involvement in business is a major topic in Morocco but public discussion of it is sensitive. The US embassy in Rabat reported to Washington in a leaked cable that "corruption is prevalent at all levels of Moroccan society".&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; Corruption allegedly reaches the highest levels in Morocco, where the business interests of Mohammed VI and some of his advisors influence "every large housing project," according to WikiLeaks documents quoted ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/151131|date=6 December 2010|title=US embassy cables: Moroccan sacking exposes king's business role|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The documents released by the whistleblower website also quote the case of a businessman working for a US consortium, whose plans in Morocco were paralysed for months after he refused to join forces with a company linked with the royal palace. Decisions on big investments in the kingdom were taken by only three people, the documents quote a company executive linked to the royal family as saying. The three are the king, his secretary [[Mounir Majidi]], and the monarch's close friend, adviser and former classmate [[Fouad Ali Himma]], the executive said at a meeting with potential investors in a Gulf country. This corruption especially affects the housing sector, the WikiLeaks documents show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/239525|title=US embassy cables: Moroccan businessman reveals royal corruption, claims US cable|date=6 December 2010|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, [[Mounir Majidi]], the personal secretary of Mohammed VI, was named in the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Panama Papers: The Power Players| publisher = [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] |url= https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/| accessdate = 3 April 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160404042238/https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/ |archivedate=4 April 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mohammed VI aime les îles Vierges" Le Monde, 04 April 2016 http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/04/04/maroc-mohammed-vi-aime-les-iles-vierges_4895300_3212.html &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal pardon scandal ===

{{main article|Daniel Galván scandal}}

Protests broke out in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, on 2 August 2013, after Mohammed VI pardoned 48 jailed Spaniards, including a pedophile who had been serving a 30-year sentence for raping 11 children aged between 4 and 15. He has since revoked the pardon, after popular outrage.&lt;ref&gt;Yaakoubi, Aziz El.

The New York Times noted "conflicting reports about whether the new monarch had been married on Friday night, within hours of his father's death [in 1999]... to heed a Moroccan tradition that a King be married before he ascends the throne."

The '''Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002''' is a [[United States federal law]] that seeks to discourage federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.  It is popularly called the '''No-FEAR Act''', and is also known as Public Law 107–174.

==Enactment==
On August 18, 2000, a federal jury found the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] guilty of violating the civil rights of Dr. [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]] on the basis of race, sex, color and a hostile work environment, under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. She was awarded $600,000. The EPA had refused to promote [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Coleman-Adebayo]] shortly after she alleged the presence of environmental and health problems at the [[Brits, North West|Brits, South Africa]], [[vanadium]] mines.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Fears, D., "Coming Soon: A Tale of Whistleblowing at the EPA," Washington Post, 10 July 2006. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/09/AR2006070900741_pf.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparked by this outcome, [[Jim Sensenbrenner|Congressman F.James Sensenbrenner]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] and [[Texas]] [[Sheila Jackson-Lee|Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee]] introduced the No-FEAR Act into Congress. Dr. [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Coleman-Adebayo]] founded the No FEAR Institute to organize support for the bill's purposes while continuing to work for the EPA.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The No FEAR Institute spearheaded the No FEAR Coalition to advocate for passage of the Act.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] signed it into law on May 15, 2002, making it the first [[United States]] [[civil rights]] law of the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;"Discrimination, Whistleblower, and Civil Rights Statutes," [https://www.employmentlawgroup.com/resources/statutes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Dr. Coleman-Adebayo]] and others have criticized implementation of the No-FEAR Act on grounds that agencies are abusing the provision allowing them a "reasonable" time to make their reimbursements to the General Fund of the Treasury.  They have proposed a No-FEAR II Act to set a time limit for such reimbursements, and to increase the penalties for violations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Book and movie==

Coleman-Adebayo wrote a book about her experience&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshacoleman-adebayo.com/no-fear-the-book.html&lt;/ref&gt; which as of 2014 is in the process of being adapted into the movie ''The Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Story''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshacoleman-adebayo.com/no-fear-the-film.html&lt;/ref&gt; with producer and actor [[Danny Glover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/09/AR2006070900741.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PromaxBDA Global Excellence and North America Awards are handed out each year at PromaxBDA's annual conference in June, which alternates between New York City and Los Angeles.

==Promax and Broadcast Design Association==
Promax was established in 1956 as a non-profit association for promotion and marketing professionals working in broadcast media. In 1997, The Broadcast Design Association (BDA) who had partnered with Promax for years on their annual conference, officially joined with Promax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promaxbda.org/about.asp?n=promaxbda|publisher=PromaxBDA|accessdate=2009-04-19|title=WHO IS PROMAX·BDA?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419223450/http://www.promaxbda.org/about.asp?n=promaxbda|archivedate=2009-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PromaxBDA awards replaced earlier awards presented separately by Promax and the Broadcast Designers Association (BDA). Thousands of PromaxBDA awards have been presented to [[Company (law)|companies]] and [[individual]]s whose work is judged by a panel of [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] and [[marketing]] professionals using three measures: overall creativity, production quality, and results in achieving marketing objectives.

==PromaxBDA==
PromaxBDA is a nonprofit professional association based in Los Angeles, with a branch office in Singapore. PromaxBDA describes itself as "the global association for the entertainment marketing industry, representing thousands of people who create, market, and distribute content in media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://promaxbda.org/about/mission|title=PromaxBDA - About Us|website=promaxbda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the United States in 1956 as the Broadcast Promotion Association (BPA), in 1985, the organization changed its name to Broadcast Promotion &amp; Marketing Executives (BPME). In 1993, the organization again changed its name to PROMAX (a loose acronym for Promotion and Marketing Executives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/broadcastpro.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Broadcast Promotion and Marketing Executives|website=www.museum.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A merger with the Broadcast Design Association (BDA) in 1997 created the current association: PromaxBDA. The legal name for the group, which has [https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/business-leagues 501(c)6] status from the IRS, is Promax International BPME.

The association holds conferences, [[award]] competitions and prints publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.multichannel.com/article/450864-VISIONARIES_INNOVATORS_POWER_BROKERS_40_Under_Forty.php| publisher= Multichannel news| date= March 29, 2010| title= VISIONARIES INNOVATORS POWER BROKERS: 40 Under Forty|accessdate= May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their members, and present [[Social network|networking]] opportunities.&lt;ref name ="Daily Brand"/&gt; Steve Kazanjian is the current President &amp; CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-kazanjian-appointed-ceo-promaxbda-752932|title=Steve Kazanjian Appointed CEO of PromaxBDA |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors is composed of senior entertainment marketing executives, and is currently chaired by Steph Sebbag, CEO of Los Angeles-based creative agency BPG.

The '''Rothschild banking family of [[England]]''' was founded in 1798 by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Mayer von Rothschild]] (1777–1836) who first settled in [[Manchester]] but then moved to [[London]]. Nathan was sent there from his home in [[Frankfurt]] by his father, [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1744–1812). Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across [[Europe]], Mayer Amschel Rothschild had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons were sent to different European cities to establish a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son, first established a [[textile]] jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]] bank in London.

From the home base in [[Frankfurt]], Rothschild sons not only established themselves in the UK but also in [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Naples]] in the [[Two Sicilies]]. Through their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavours&lt;!--Please don't delete the "u" as the word "England" appears in the title of this article--&gt; including [[loan]]s, [[government bond]]s and trading in [[bullion]]. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century they became major stakeholders in large-scale [[mining]] and [[rail transport]] ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of [[Europe]].

Changes in the heads of government, war, and other such events affected the family's fortunes both for their benefit and to their detriment. However, three historical events in particular especially damaged the interests of all Rothschild banking families across Europe: 1) the [[Revolutions of 1848]], 2) the [[Great Depression|Great Depression of the 1930s]] and 3) [[Nazism]] of the late 1930s until the [[World War II|Second World War]].

== Involvement in finance and industry ==
During the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], therefore funding war. In 1818 the Rothschild bank arranged a £5 million loan to the [[Prussia]]n government and the issuing of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] for government [[loan]]s. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons financial strength in the [[City of London]] became such that by 1825–26, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crisis.

Nathan Mayer's eldest son, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808–1879) succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of [[Egypt]]'s interest in the [[Suez Canal]]. Lionel also began to invest in railways as his uncle [[James Mayer de Rothschild|James]] had been doing in France. In 1869, Lionel's son, [[Alfred de Rothschild]] (1842–1918), became a [[List of directors of the Bank of England|director of the Bank of England]], a post he held for 20 years.  Alfred was one of those who represented the British Government at the 1892 [[International Monetary Conferences|International Monetary Conference]] in [[Brussels]].

The Rothschild bank funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the development of the [[British South Africa Company]] and [[Leopold de Rothschild]] (1845–1917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] scheme at [[Oxford University]].  In 1873, [[de Rothschild Frères]] in France and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of [[London]] joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and UK Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[South Africa]], becoming its largest shareholders.

The London banking house continued under the management of [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] (1882–1942) and his brother [[Anthony Gustav de Rothschild]] (1887–1961) and then to [[Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of [[London]], the UK and French financial firms merged under the leadership of [[David René de Rothschild]].

== Other activities ==
Beyond banking and finance, members of the Rothschild family in UK became [[academic]]s, [[scientist]]s and [[horticulture|horticulturalists]] with worldwide reputations.

[[Nathaniel de Rothschild]] (1812–1870) was born in [[London]], the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family. In 1842, he married cousin [[Charlotte de Rothschild]] (1825–1899) of [[Paris]], [[France]]. She was the daughter of [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] and in 1850 they moved to Paris where he was to work for his father-in-law's bank. However, in 1853, Nathaniel acquired Château Brane Mouton, a [[vineyard]] in [[Pauillac]] in the [[Gironde]] [[département]] of France.

== Elevated to Peerage ==
In 1822, the five Rothschild brothers at the head of the family's banks in various parts of Europe were each granted the title of [[baron]] or [[Freiherr]] by [[Austria]]'s [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], formerly [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. As such, some members of the family used "de" or "von" Rothschild to acknowledge the grant of nobility. 

In 1847, [[Anthony Nathan de Rothschild]] (1810–1876) was created ''1st Baronet de Rothschild, of [[Tring|Tring Park]]''. On his death, the title went to his nephew [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan Mayer Rothschild II]] who was subsequently elevated to the [[House of Lords]] and created [[Baron Rothschild]] in 1885 with which title the baronetcy remains merged.

In 1850 [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808–1879) became the first practising Jewish member of the [[British House of Commons|British Parliament]].

== Philanthropy ==
The UK Rothschilds and members of the other branches in Europe were all major contributors to causes in aid of the Jewish people. However, many of their philanthropic efforts extended far beyond Jewish ethnic or religious communities. They built hospitals and shelters for the needy, supported cultural institutions and were patrons of individual artists. Their donation of works of art to various galleries has been the largest of any family in history. At present, a research project is underway by The Rothschild Archive [https://web.archive.org/web/20130823152508/http://www.rothschildarchive.org/ib/?doc=%2Fib%2Farticles%2Fproject1pd] in London to document the family's philanthropic involvements.

[[Image:Cpscmagnetixtoyrecall.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetix]], a popular construction toy selling over 3.8 million units, was recalled after injuries and a fatality when magnets came loose.]]
'''Toy safety''' is the practice of ensuring that [[toy]]s, especially those made for children, are safe, usually through the application of set [[safety standards]].  In many countries, commercial toys must be able to pass safety tests in order to be sold. In the U.S., some toys must meet national standards, while other toys may not have to meet a defined safety standard. In countries where standards exist, they exist in order to prevent accidents, but there have still been some high-profile [[product recall]]s after such problems have occurred.  The danger is often not due to faulty design; usage and chance both play a role in injury and death incidents as well.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"&gt;The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]], March 2001.  "[http://www.rospa.com/productsafety/factsheets/toysafety.htm Toy Safety Factsheet]".  Accessed 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential hazards==
[[Image:Someone ate simba.JPG|right|thumb|Small toys may be swallowed by children, such as this electronic button seen in a child's stomach.  Toys stuck in the [[esophagus]] or too large to pass through the [[stomach]] may need to be removed with [[endoscopic foreign body retrieval|endoscopes]].]]
Common scenarios include:
*Ingestion of magnetic toys
*[[Choking]] or aspiration of small parts of the toy
*Cuts by sharp parts of the toy
*Motor toy vehicles incidents involving  hair 
*Chemical substance

==Accident frequency==
Accidents involving toys are quite common, with 40,000 happening each year in the United Kingdom (according to 1998 figures&lt;ref name="1998DTI"&gt;[[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], 2000 (using 1998 data).  "Home Accident Surveillance System, 22nd Annual report".&lt;/ref&gt; - data has not been collected in the UK since 2003&lt;ref&gt;[https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/welcome.jsp European Injury database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), accounting for less than 1% of annual accidents. In 2005 in the U.S., 20 children under 15 years of age died in incidents associated with toys, and an estimated 202,300 children under 15 were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with toys, according to data from the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's]] National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.&lt;ref name="CPSC Toy Report"&gt;CSPC, 5 October 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/library/toymemo05.pdf Toy-Related Deaths and Injuries, Calendar Year 2005]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, no fatal accidents have been reported in the European Injury Database since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/result.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, home and leisure data was examined concerning injuries caused by falls to a lower level among 0-4-year-olds from Austria, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Sweden. It was found that children′s use of several product categories was closely related to age. Children′s furniture account for between 21% (Netherlands) and 34% (Sweden) of the injuries from falls to a lower level in the first living year, but decreased with increasing age in all countries. The same pattern applied to strollers. In contrast, injuries due to falls involving playground equipment increased with age to reach between 13 (Greece) and 34 (Netherlands) percent of injuries from falls to a lower level among 4-year-olds. Bicycles also increase with age, reaching between 4 (Netherlands) and 17 (Denmark) percent among 4-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Consumer rights for child safety products"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincenten|first1=Joanne|title=Consumer rights for child safety products|url=http://www.leokids.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rights_child_safety_prod.pdf|ref=Consumer rights for child safety products}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety standards==
Distinction must be drawn between [[regulations]] and voluntary [[safety standards]]. From the table below, it can be seen that many regions model their safety standards on the EU's [[EN 71]] standard, either directly, or through adoption of the ISO 8124 standard which itself is modelled on EN 71.

In [[Europe]] toys must meet the criteria set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) in order for them to carry the [[CE mark]].  All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995.&lt;ref name="lbwf"&gt;"[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19950204_en_1.htm The Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995]".  Accessed 7 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trading Standards Officers in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the RAPEX recall notification system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation).&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm EUROPA - Consumer Affairs - Safe Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074207/http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm |date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Canada]] the government [[Ministry (government department)|department]] [[Health Canada]] has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) does in the [[United States]]. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/toys.html] Harmonised EU toy safety standards&lt;/ref&gt; as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.

===Appropriate age===
[[File:Age warning symbol.svg|thumb|Age warning symbol specified in the European standard [[EN 71]]-6.]]
Manufacturers often display information about the intended age of the children who will play with the toy.  In the U.S. this label is sometimes mandated by the CPSC, especially for toys which may present a [[choking]] hazard for children under three years of age. In most countries the intended age is either shown as a minimum age or as an age range.  While one reason for this is the complexity of the toy and how much it will interest or challenge children of different ages, another is to highlight that it may be unsafe for younger children. While a toy might be ''suitable'' for children of one age, and thus this is the age ''recommended'' on the product, there may be safety hazards associated with use by a lower age group, necessitating a mandatory warning. Some manufacturers also explain the specific dangers next to the advised age (as is mandated by European and International toy safety standards EN71 and ISO 8124 respectively, but not US standard ASTM F963).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/consumers/Safety/products/child-products/Toys/index.html Toy Safety Regulations - BERR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some accidents occur when babies play with toys intended for older children.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;

===United States regulations===
In August 2008, the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] (''CPSIA'') was passed.  Some observers are of the opinion that this new law imposes the toughest toy-making standard in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-consumer-safety,0,7590962.story | title=Bush signs bill banning lead from children's toys; toughest standard in the world | publisher=Associated Press | date=14 August 2008 | accessdate=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CPSIA restricts the amount of [[lead]] and [[phthalates]] that may be contained in children's products (ages 12 and under) and adopts the provisions of the ''ASTM Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety'' (ASTM F963-11) as the requirements of the CPSC.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 2051 Sec. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the US state of [[Minnesota]] introduced its own legislation that requires reporting information on a list of priority chemicals found in children’s products and sold in the state. This law demands all manufacturers of toys to provide the state of Minnesota with a report if their children’s products contain any of the priority chemicals such as [[Bisphenol A]], [[Formaldehyde]], [[lead]] or [[cadmium]].

===European regulations===
In Europe, the comprehensive legislation addressing toy safety is ''the Toy Safety Directive'' of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]], ([[Council Directive]] 88/378/EEC). This directive is a list of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective Toy Safety Regulations (e.g.: the UK's ''Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 ([[Statutory Instrument]] 1995 No. 204)'').  This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF] Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys&lt;/ref&gt; which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the chemical requirements of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a [[CE Mark]], which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment.  Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/toys/eg_guidance.htm] Official guidance on the classification of toys&lt;/ref&gt;  Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive.  The toy safety directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.
The Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 Toy Safety Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.
If a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of ''due diligence'' (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the safety of the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.

The new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD) requires a series of safety assessments, including the Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA). If the non-chemical requirements were already enforced in July 2011, the chemical requirements are to be enforced first on 20 July 2013. In 2009, the European Union adopted the new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD). The [[Comité Européen de Normalisation]] or CEN wrote these standards in order for them to be harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive.  Official EU Guidance&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4208/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native] Guidance document on the application of the toy safety directive 2009/48/EC&lt;/ref&gt; on the interpretation of the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC exists and although non-binding, it has been agreed by a majority of EU Member States.

===Chinese regulations===
China's toy industry has been regulated since early 2007 by the expansion of the nation's compulsory certification system to include toy products.
Regulations require a manufacturers to apply for [[China Compulsory Certificate|China Compulsory Certification]] (CCC) from the nation's Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). From 1 March, toy producers in China have been able to apply to three certification agencies nominated by the CNCA to certify their products. Toys are subject to inspection and certification review. Since 1 June 2007, no toy products without CCCs has been be allowed to leave factories, be sold or be imported into China.  It is hoped this measure will mitigate the increasing international pressure on environmental protection, as well as further expand the nation's toy export market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200604/01/eng20060401_255145.html People's Daily Online - Toy industry gets improved regulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This increase in scrutiny was introduced before the [[2007 Chinese export recalls]].

==Safety testing==
The EU Commission expert group on toy safety regularly publishes a large number of guidance documents &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm European Guidance Documents on Toys]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to help on interpretation issues related to the [[Toy safety#European regulations|Toy Safety Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm Guidance documents from the Expert Group on Toy Safety] European Commission, Retrieved 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Toy manufacturers need stay ahead of regulatory changes and be sure that their products comply with the new requirements.

Therefore, it is vital to perform tests and risk assessments for every product before selling them in the designated market. This is important for every manufacturer as they can be held liable for injuries and fatalities resulting from design flaws, use of unsuitable materials, and substandard production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btha.co.uk/dynamic/documents/toysafety/06%20Safety%20Assessment%20of%20Toys%20-%20Daryl%20Scrivens.pdf Safety Assessment of Toys]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following safety tests are performed:
* Mechanical/physical testing
* Flammability testing
* Electrical safety testing
* Labeling
* Chemical testing

Product safety/risk assessment (also known as product hazard analysis) can identify potential hazards and provide solutions early in the product life cycle to prevent products becoming stalled in production or recalled once they are released onto the market. During risk assessments for toys possible hazards and potential exposure are analyzed. Additionally the manufacturing of the toys will be controlled to ensure safety and quality throughout production.

The new European standard EN 71-4:2013 was published in 2013. It replaces and updates the 2009 version of the same standard since the latter and newest has been harmonized under the EU [[Toy Safety]] Directive. The new method is a reference test method regulating [[chemicals]] in toys and juvenile products. This gives a new test method for 'Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities' under the toy safety EN 71 series.

==International commerce==
International commerce plays a big role in toy safety. In the first four months of 2006, China exported US$4 billion worth of toys. The United States contributed 70 percent of the global market by exporting US$15.2 billion in toys in 2005.  The European Union accounts for 75% of the final disposition of these toys. From January 2005 through September 2006, products originating in China were responsible for about 48 percent of product recalls in the U.S., and a similar percentage of notifications in the EU.&lt;ref name="China Econ Review"&gt;China Economic Review, January 2007.  "[http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/subscriber/articledetail/1526.htmll REPORTS / Better safe than sorry]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of process control in sub-contracted vendors has been a contributing factor in recent high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6948274.stm | work=BBC News | title='Brand China' at risk after toy recall | date=15 August 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moves toward global standards===
Although an international toy safety standard exists, nations around the world still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-icti.org/info/toysafetystandards.html Toy Safety Standards Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has been seen in the large scale [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls of 2007]], sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.
Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the [[ISO 9000]] systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.
The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/qmp/qmp-6.htm Quality management principles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.
In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as [http://www.lga.de/ LGA], [http://www.eurofins.com/product-testing-services/industries/toy-testing.aspx Eurofins], [[Bureau Veritas]] or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUKL0889219620071108?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | title=EU, U.S. seek new global toy safety standard | first=Darren | last=Ennis | date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineers.ihs.com/news/ansi-toy-safety.htm ANSI: Toy Safety Takes High Priority with Standards Developers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.

==Product recalls and safety hazards==
The ability to [[product recall|recall]] a product from the market is a necessary part of any safety legislation. If existing quality and safety checks fail to detect an issue prior to sale, a systematic method of notifying the public and removing potentially hazardous products from the market is needed.
Some toys have been discovered to have been unsafe after they have been placed on the market.  Before the introduction of safety monitoring organisations the toys were simply stopped being manufactured if any action was taken at all{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, but since then there have been many toys that have been recalled by their manufacturer.  In some notable cases the problem has only been found after the injury or even death of a person that purchased the product.

Choking is the number one reason for accidents, but chemicals such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ and system in the human body, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic to the brains of young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.xos.com/blog/bid/343549/EPA-Prevention-Week-Highlights-the-Importance-of-Lead-Detection EPA Lead Safety Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection are responsible for screening children's products imported into the country.  Just less than 10% of products screened are stopped for violations.  Nearly two thirds are stopped for lead violations and 15% are stopped for choking hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2013/More-than-48M-Units-of-Violative-Imported-Products-Kept-at-Bay-During-Fiscal-Year-2012/ More than 4.8M Units of Violative Imported Products Kept at Bay During Fiscal Year 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom toys are regulated by the Toy Product Safety Regulations 1995 which require that toys must not be sold if they do not have the correct safety labels.

===Examples===

====Bindeez/Beados====
Batches of [[Bindeez]] were recalled in November 2007 after several children swallowed beads and were adversely affected. Upon ingestion, a chemical used in the product metabolized in the stomach into the sedative drug, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. The design called for a different, non-toxic chemical, but this had been substituted with an alternative chemical, which had approximately the same functional properties. The name was changed to "Beados" in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theillustrator.ca/Headlines/China-admits-that-poison-was-in-toys.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids====
The [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls were very popular in the 1980s across North America and many parts of Europe.  The "Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids" line of dolls were an early 1990s incarnation designed to "eat" [[plastic]] snacks.  The mechanism was a pair of one-way metal rollers behind a plastic slot and rubber lips, and there were 35 reported incidents in which a child's hair or finger was caught in the mouths.  On 31 December 1996, after 700,000 dolls were distributed in the [[United States]] in just five months, the CPSC along with manufacturers [[Mattel]] announced that they would place warning information labels on all unsold dolls.&lt;ref name="KidSourceCPK"&gt;KidSource, 31 December 1996.  "[http://www.kidsource.com/cpsc/cabbage.warning.html CPSC and Mattel Announce Warning for Cabbage Patch Doll]".  Accessed 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, in January 1997, CPSC and Mattel announced that all Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids were being removed from the market.&lt;ref name="CPSC Cabbage Patch Press Release"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 6 January 1997.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml97/97055.html Mattel and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Announce Voluntary Refund Program for Cabbage Patch Kids &amp; Snacktime Kids Dolls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220001659/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97055.html |date=20 February 2008 }}". Nowadays, some websites on the Internet say that the dolls are evil and eat human flesh.

====Lawn darts====
[[Image:Lawndart.jpg|thumb|A safety warning given out by the CPSC.]]
[[Lawn darts]] are large, weighted darts intended to be tossed underhand towards a horizontal ground target.  On 19 December 1988, all lawn darts were banned from sale in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission after they were responsible for the deaths of three children since 1970.&lt;ref name="CPSCLawnDarts"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC).

Lawn darts with elongated tips.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetix====
One death and four serious injuries led to the recall of 3.8 million [[Magnetix]] building sets in March 2006.  The [[magnets]] inside the plastic building pieces could fall out and be swallowed or aspirated.&lt;ref name="CPSCMagnetix"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 31 March 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html Child’s Death Prompts Replacement Program of Magnetic Building Sets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405113358/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html |date=5 April 2006 }}".

====Polly Pocket====
In November 2006 4.4 million [[Polly Pocket]] Quik-Clik sets were recalled by Mattel after children in the United States swallowed loose magnetic parts.  The toys had been sold around the world commencing three years previous.&lt;ref name="ScotsmanPP"&gt;[[The Scotsman]], 22 November 2006.  "[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 Toy recall over magnet hazard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116050215/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 |date=16 November 2007 }}".

====Clackers ====
[[Clackers]] were discontinued when reports came out of children becoming injured while playing with them and after a ruling in [[United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls]] that they were hazards in the United States. Fairly heavy and fast-moving, and made of hard [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic plastic]], the balls would occasionally shatter upon striking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Google | title = Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pz8mD9Vn6OQC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=clackers+toy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hbPqTqKDOozKiQLO6InPBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=clackers%20toy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Razor Scooter ====
The CSPC issued a voluntary Razor scooter recall, specifically targeting the Razor PowerWing three-wheeled scooters. Around 103,000 Razor scooters were affected by this recall. The reason for the [[Razor scooter]] recall is that the underside of the foot platform can have sharp edges, thus leading to a laceration hazard to kids who are riding the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Tulane Corporate Law Institute''' is an annual two-day [[M&amp;A]] and [[corporate law]] conference that takes place in [[New Orleans Central Business District|downtown New Orleans]] every spring.  It attracts the most high-profile lawyers and bankers from around the United States, as well as judges, journalists, and others who follow the dealmaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
In the late 1980s, [[Delaware Supreme Court]] Justice Andrew G.T. Moore (author of ''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'' and ''[[Revlon v. MacAndrews]]'') and a group of New Orleans corporate practitioners were among those who undertook an aggressive goal: to establish a new annual platform for a gathering of the nation's
leading corporate jurists and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Life_After_Law_School/CLE/PDFs_for_Events_and_Conferences/CLI-BROCHURE-WEB.pdf | title=20th Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute Brochure|year=2008|publisher= Tulane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 20 years later, the Tulane Corporate Law Institute remains a critical meeting place for national leaders in the fields of law and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second day of the 22nd annual meeting (on April 16, 2010), coincided with [[Goldman_Sachs#SEC_Fraud_Lawsuit.2C_April_2010|the unexpected release of an SEC fraud complaint against Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/s-e-c-inquiry-may-widen-khuzami-hints/#more-210215 | work=The New York Times | title=S.E.C.

Although the procedure is named using the generic [[alternative dispute resolution]] title, Turnaround ADR is not a procedure for resolving disputes. Rather, it offers a way for [[financial distress|financially stressed companies]] to reassess and restructure debts.

== Features ==
When a Turnaround ADR is applied, the [[debtor]] can maintain payment to business partners and customers. Only claims held by financial institutions participating in this procedure become subject to adjustment; if the relevant institutions reach consensus, the debts can be minimized.

Turnaround ADR is frequently misunderstood in the [[United States]] and other Western nations because no equivalent procedure exists there. Applying for or initiating a Turnaround ADR is not considered a [[Default (finance)|default]] triggering event. Rather, adopting a Turnaround ADR is considered a preferable procedure for financially distressed companies as it provides breathing space for such companies to focus on revitalizing their business. Such space is gained by the alleviation of debts against relevant financial institutions without adversely affecting integral business relationships with partners and customers.

A private operator certified by the [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] and the [[Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry]], provides mediation services in a Turnaround ADR.  The [[Japanese Association of Turnaround Professionals]] (JATP) is the only private operator certified to provide mediation services for Turnaround ADR.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news | title = Japan Credit-Default Swaps Seen Unraveling on Aiful’s Bad Debts  | author = Yusuke Miyazawa | author2 = Shannon D.

This mediator is responsible for implementing the Turnaround ADR procedure fairly and objectively.

The '''Vanderbilt family''' is an American family of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] origin who gained prominence during the [[Gilded Age]]. Their success began with the shipping and railroad empires of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], and the family expanded into various other areas of industry and philanthropy. Cornelius Vanderbilt's descendants went on to build grand mansions on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]], luxurious "summer cottages" in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the palatial [[Biltmore House]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], and [[Vanderbilt houses|various other opulent homes]].

The Vanderbilts were once the wealthiest family in America. Cornelius Vanderbilt was the [[List of richest Americans in history|richest American]] until his death in 1877. After that, his son William acquired his father's fortune, and was the richest American until his death in 1885. The Vanderbilts' prominence lasted until the mid-20th century, when the family's 10 great [[Fifth Avenue]] mansions were torn down, and most other [[Vanderbilt houses]] were sold or turned into museums in what has been referred to as the "Fall of the House of Vanderbilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/books/more-money-than-anyone-else.html|work=The New York Times| title= Review of ''Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt''|date=September 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt |last=Vanderbilt |first=Arthur T., II |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-688-07279-8 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches of the family are found on the [[United States East Coast]]. Contemporary descendants include fashion designer [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], her youngest son, journalist [[Anderson Cooper]], actor [[Timothy Olyphant]], musician [[John P. Hammond]] and screenwriter [[James Vanderbilt]].

[[File:Vanderbilt Mansion - IMG 7939.JPG|thumb|right|[[Frederick William Vanderbilt]]'s home, now known as the [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site]].]]

The progenitor of the Vanderbilt family was Jan Aertszoon or Aertson (1620–1705), a Dutch farmer from the village of [[De Bilt]] in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]], who emigrated to the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] as an [[indentured servant]] to the [[Wolphert Gerretse|Van Kouwenhoven family]] in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Kelly MacDowell. ''Commodore Vanderbilt and his family: a biographical account of the Descendants of Cornelius and Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt''. 1989. University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb40EosBr90C&amp;pg=PT70&amp;dq "American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America"], Colin Woodard. Penguin, Sep 29, 2011. Retrieved 13 may 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Jan's village name was added to the Dutch "Van" (from) to create "Van der Bilt", which evolved into Vanderbilt when the English took control of [[New Amsterdam]] (now [[Manhattan]]). The family is associated with the Dutch [[Nederland's Patriciaat|patrician]] Van der Bilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://194.171.109.12/download/cbg_patriciaat_lijst.pdf |title=List of Dutch patrician families in the Nederland's Patriciaat 1910-2007/2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His great-great-great-grandson [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] began the prominence of the family, the fourth of nine children born to a [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]] family of modest means. Through his paternal great-great grandmother Abigail Southard, he descends from [[Republic of Salé]] President [[Jan Janszoon]] and his son [[Anthony Janszoon van Salee]]. They were among the earliest arrivals to 17th century [[New Amsterdam]]. In a number of documents dating back to this period, Anthony is described as tawny or mulatto,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3qSTNdp1t0C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq "Origins of the Black Atlantic"], Laurent Dubois, Julius S.

Smith. Washington D.C. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelius Vanderbilt left school at age 11 and went on to build a [[Merchant navy|shipping]] and [[railroad]] empire that, during the 19th century, would make him one of the wealthiest men in the world. Starting with a single boat, he grew his fleet until he was competing with [[Robert Fulton]] for dominance of the New York waterways, his energy and eagerness earning him the nickname "Commodore", then the highest rank in the United States Navy. Fulton's company had established a monopoly on trade in and out of [[New York Harbor]]. Vanderbilt, based in New Jersey at the time, flouted the law, steaming in and out of the harbor under a flag that read, "New Jersey Must Be Free!" He also hired the attorney [[Daniel Webster]] to argue his case before the [[United States Supreme Court]]; Vanderbilt won, thereby establishing an early precedent for America's first laws of [[interstate commerce]].

The Vanderbilt family lived on Staten Island until the mid-1800s, when the Commodore built a house on Washington Place (in what is now [[Greenwich Village]]). Although he always occupied a relatively modest home, members of his family would use their wealth to build magnificent [[Vanderbilt houses|mansions]]. Shortly before his death in 1877, Vanderbilt donated [[US dollar|US$]]1 million for the establishment of [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

The Commodore left the majority of his enormous fortune to his eldest son, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]]. William Henry, who outlived his father by just eight years, increased the profitability of his father's holdings, increased the reach of the [[New York Central Railroad]], and doubled the Vanderbilt wealth. He built the first of what would become many grand Vanderbilt mansions on [[Fifth Avenue]], at 640 Fifth Avenue. William Henry appointed his first son, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]], as the next "Head of House".

Cornelius II built the largest private home in New York, at 1 West [[58th Street (Manhattan)|58th Street]], containing approximately 154 rooms, designed by [[George B. Post]]. He also built [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Cornelius II's brother, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]], also featured prominently in the family's affairs. He also built a magnificent home on Fifth Avenue and would become one of the great architectural patrons of the [[Gilded Age]], hiring the architects for (the third, and surviving) [[Grand Central Terminal]]. He also built [[Marble House]] at 596 Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island.

[[George Washington Vanderbilt II]], [[William Henry Vanderbilt]]'s youngest son, built [[Biltmore Estate|Biltmore]], in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].

While some of Cornelius Vanderbilt's descendants gained fame in business, others achieved prominence in other ways, e.g.:
* [[Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt]] (1877–1915), was a passenger on the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] and died when it sank.  
*Alfred's son [[Alfred G. Vanderbilt II|Alfred Jr.]] became a noted horse breeder and racing elder. 
*[[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]] (1884–1970) gained fame as a sportsman. He invented the [[Contract bridge|contract form of bridge]] and won the most coveted prize in yacht racing, the [[America's Cup]], on three occasions. 
*Harold's brother [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II|William Kissam "Willie K" Vanderbilt II]] launched the [[Vanderbilt Cup]] for [[auto racing]].  
*[[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] was Governor of Rhode Island. 
*[[Gloria Vanderbilt]] is a noted artist, designer and author.

The Vanderbilt [[Mausoleum]] was designed in 1885 by [[architect]] [[Richard Morris Hunt]] and landscaped by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].

== Family connection (chronological listing) ==
''The following list includes etiquette guru [[Amy Vanderbilt]] (1908–1974), although it is believed she descended from either an uncle or brother of Cornelius Vanderbilt and is therefore not a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

==2015==
[[File:Dublin Web Summit 2015.jpg|thumb|Web Summit, 2015]]
Web Summit 2015 was held over three days from 3 November until the 5 November at the RDS in Dublin. Over 42,000 people attended the event over the three days. Speakers included [[Ed Catmull]] of [[Pixar]], [[Michael Dell]], [[Bill Ford]] and [[Chris Froome]].

In September 2015 Web Summit announced that they would be moving the event from Dublin to Lisbon. Following the announcement organisers released email correspondence between the Irish Government and Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave about hotel costs, traffic and other issues around infrastructure in Dublin. This led to a debate in the Irish media about the support the Government had provided to the event since it began and what future promises they could make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criticism over Government handling of Web Summit grows|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/criticism-over-government-handling-of-web-summit-grows-1.2394418|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems arose with the Wi-Fi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old problems surface one last time at Web Summit|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/old-problems-surface-one-last-time-at-web-summit-1.2416018|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on a lesser scale than in 2014.

==2014==
[[File:Sportsfile (Web Summit) (15711830185) (2).jpg|thumb|Paddy Cosgrave and Taoiseach [[Enda Kenny]] at the 2014 Web Summit]]
Web Summit 2014 was held over three days and consisted of nine stages or Summits as they are known; Centre, Machine, Enterprise, Marketing, Builders, Society, Sport, Film and Music. [[Eva Longoria]], [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Bono]] were among the speakers that spoke over the three-day event, with attendance of 22,000 people from 109 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/web-summit/live-blog-web-summit-2014-30714271.html|title= Live Blog: Web Summit 2014|date=4 November 2014 |work=Irish Independent|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.herald.ie/news/web-summit-guests-to-spend-100m-in-city-30714966.html|title= Web Summit guests to spend €100m in city|date=4 November 2014 |work=Herald|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 1 there were problems with the [[WiFi]] network and Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave took to the stage on two occasions to apologise for the connectivity problems. The RDS defended their technical set-up with CEO Michael Duffy saying, "The WiFi has successfully responded to the exceptional demands placed on it. This is an unprecedented WiFi density compared to similar European tech events." Attendees were mostly disparaging in their remarks, with some deriding it on social media as "the most Irish thing ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-web-summit-wifi-1762398-Nov2014/|title = 'The most Irish thing ever': WiFi trouble at Dublin's Web Summit|date=4 November 2014|work=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International broadcasters including [[CNBC]], [[CNN]], Fox Business News, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Sky News]]. Al Jazeera and the BBC all covered the event.

After the announcement of the decision to move the 2016 Web Summit to Lisbon, several Irish technology correspondents cited the WiFi debacle as one major push factor behind the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/2015/09/23/web-summit-lisbon-2016|title=Web Summit to move to Lisbon in 2016, cites infrastructure reasons|date=23 Sep 2015|work=Silicon Republic|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/smallbusiness/harsh-reality-for-irish-technology-scene-356186.html|title=Harsh reality for Irish technology scene|work=Irish Examiner|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
