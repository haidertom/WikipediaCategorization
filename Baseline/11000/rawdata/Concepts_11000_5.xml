'''Abnormal behavior   of birds in captivity''' can be defined in several ways.  [[Abnormality (behavior)|Statistically]], 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies [[statistically significant]]ly, either more or less, from the normal value.  This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual.  Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for captive [[birds]] of that particular class or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/abnormal+behavior|title=abnormal behaviour|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'.  This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised as part of the [[ethogram]] of that species.

Most abnormal behaviours can be categorised collectively (e.g., eliminative, ingestive, stereotypies), however, many abnormal behaviours fall debatebly into several of these categories and categorisation is therefore not attempted in this article.  Abnormal behaviours here are considered to be related to captive housing but may also be due to medical conditions.  The article does not include behaviours in birds that are genetically modified to express abnormal behaviour.


When housed under captive or commercial conditions, birds often show a range of abnormal behaviours. These are often self-injurious or harmful to other individuals, and include:

&lt;br /&gt;When analyzing the behaviour of birds in captivity, what is considered normal or abnormal behaviour is dependent on the form and frequency that the particular behaviour is expressed in the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wiepkema, P.R. (1985). Abnormal behavior in farm animals: ethological implications. Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 35, 279-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Birds raised in pet stores tend to be raised with other birds, however, after being sold and taken to the owner's home, birds in captivity are often housed in isolation and in environments lacking abundant resources or complex stimuli. In the United States, it is estimated that forty million birds are kept caged and improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;“There is no such thing as a cage bird”. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. &lt;http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animals/caging-birds.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these inappropriate housing conditions, abnormal behaviour patterns may appear in [[birdcage|caged birds]] kept as pets. Once established, these abnormal behaviours in birds are often not alterable.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Cate, C. (1995). Behavioral development in birds and the implications of imprinting and song learning for captive propagation. Research and Captive Propagation, 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

When social interactions amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding [[parrot]]s that had been isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this [[social deprivation]] had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, [[feather-plucking|feather picking]], [[self-harm|self-mutilation]], restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and [[stereotypy|stereotypies]].&lt;ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993"&gt;Lantermann, W. (1993). Social deprivation in Amazon parrots. Animal Behaviour, 38, 511-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannibalism often occurs in large [[animal husbandry]] systems, which are usually impoverished environments with a lack of opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, B.O. &amp; Duncan, I.J.H. (1998). The notion of ethological “need,” models of motivation and animal welfare. Animal Behaviour, 36, 1696-1707.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies.&lt;ref name="Sargent" /&gt; These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of [[bird vocalization|song learning]] in [[zebra finch]]es has also been implicated as a behavioural abnormality.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, P.J, B., Jones, A. &amp; Ten Cate, C. (1993). Can lack of experience delay the end of the  sensitive phase for song learning? Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 43, 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned. 

Researchers have analyzed ways to alleviate some abnormal behaviours in caged birds. Presenting these birds with novel stimuli e.g. a mirror or plastic birds, and social stimuli, such as a brief view of a bird in another cage, significantly reduced stereotypies.&lt;ref&gt;Keiper, R.R. (1970). Studies of stereotypy function in the canary (Serinus canarius). Animal Behaviour, 18, 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been suggested that keeping caged birds in pairs or small groups may reduce the development of abnormal behaviours, however, little quantitative evidence has thus far been collected to support this claim.&lt;ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">'''[https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now]''' is a global platform, founded in 2008 by a group of independent non-profit organisations, which is intended to foster [[accountability]] and [[Transparency (behaviour)#Non-governmental organizations|transparency]] of [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organisations]] (CSOs), as well as stakeholder  communication and performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf INGO Accountability Charter] &lt;/ref&gt; It supports CSOs to be transparent, responsive to stakeholders and focused on delivering impact. 

Accountable Now was founded under the name International NGO Charter of Accountability by eleven leading CSOs, including development, humanitarian, environmental, rights-based and advocacy organisations. As Membership and global collaboration increase, CSOs collective voices are strengthened. Today, 29 Member Organisations are active in more than 150 countries and impact stakeholders all over the world.

== Background ==
CSOs are more important than ever before in framing and influencing social, political and economic environments. On the national level they provide disaster relief and social service, promote self-help and self- governance in developing countries where they are operating. In addition they enhance a strong international [[Civil society|Civil Society]] by creating informal but important normative regimes which are influencing international institutions in their decision-making. This greater involvement of CSOs also raises the question of how they justify their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. David and Mark H. Moore (2001): “Accountability, Strategy, and International Nongovernmental Organizations”, in: “Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly” 30: p.569, online: [http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/30/3/569]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSOs have a particular interest in meeting standards on accountability and transparency in view of the responsibilities towards not only the cause which they are meant to serve, but also stakeholders of various types, including donors and sponsors (possibly comprising corporations and governments), intended program beneficiaries, staff and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Maria Francesch-Huidobro: ''Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), {{ISBN|978-981-230-831-3}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Kumi Naidoo: ''Global civic society: Rallying for real change''.

Accountable Now is considered a contributing element to underscoring the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of CSOs.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Matthews: ''Intellectual Property, Human Rights and Development: The Role of NGOs and Social Movements'', MPG Books Group, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-84720-785-2}}, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CxgHNQz5Oq8C&amp;pg=PA229 p. 229]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

===Development===
At the International Advocacy Non-Government Organisations (IANGO) Workshop hosted by Transparency International in June 2003, the importance of promoting accountability and legitimacy was discussed by its participants. As they recognised their growing involvement in international issues the need of promoting accountability was highlighted. The Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organisations at the Harvard University was asked for a research paper on the topic to provide a foundation for following discussions.
At the following annual meetings in 2004 and 2005 the participants analysed their own concepts of accountability, set up an initial draft and with the help of independent consultant specialists revised the draft until a final version was ready to launch.&lt;ref&gt;Explore Charter background on: {{cite web|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170305/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption ===
[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf The INGO Accountability Charter], signed in June 2006 by eleven leading [[international NGO]]s active in the area of [[human rights]], environment and social development, set the course for the establishment of Accountable Now (then known as the INGO Accountability Charter) and it has been referred to as “the first ever set of international and cross-sector guidelines for the NGO sector”&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"&gt;Lael Brainard, Derek Chollet (editors): ''Global development 2.0: can philanthropists, the public, and the poor make poverty history?'', The Brookings Institution, {{ISBN|978-0-8157-1393-7}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tgDGgLaDw8IC&amp;pg=PA175 p. 175]&lt;/ref&gt; and the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stuart Thompson: ''Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civic society forum''. In: James W. St. G. Walker, Andrew S. Thompson: ''Critical mass: the emergence of global civil society'', The Centre for International Governance Innovation and Wilfried Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-55458-022-4}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3Q0rFXjPQ4C&amp;pg=PA214 p. 214]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding Signatories ===
The founding signatories were [[ActionAid|ActionAid International]], [[Amnesty International]], [[CIVICUS]] World Alliance for Citizen Participation, [[Consumers International]], [[Greenpeace International]], [[Oxfam International]], [[International Save the Children Alliance]], [[Survival International]], [[Terre des hommes|International Federation Terre des Hommes]], [[Transparency International]] and [[World YWCA]].

== Articles ==
The charter is ''based on ten core principles and aimed at enhancing respect for human rights, good governance, accountability and transparency, encouraging stakeholder communication, promoting inclusion and environmental responsibility, and improving organisational performance and effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"/&gt; It documents the commitment of [[international NGO]]s to these aims. 

== Organisation ==
In 2008, the signatory-NGOs decided to found an independent organisation of the same name ''International NGO Accountability Charter Ltd'' in order to organise the reporting and vetting process of the member organisations against the charter commitments and develop them further. Today, the organisation operates under the name [https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now] and has 29 member organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-accountable-now/|title=Who we are|newspaper=Accountable Now|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the philosophical term||Aletheia (disambiguation)}}

'''''Aletheia''''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀλήθεια|ἀλήθεια]]}}) is truth or disclosure in philosophy. It was used in Ancient Greek philosophy and revived in the 20th century by [[Martin Heidegger]].

It is a [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word variously translated as "unclosedness", "unconcealedness", "[[world disclosure|disclosure]]" or "[[truth]]". The literal meaning of the word {{lang|grc|[[alpha privative|ἀ]]–[[Lethe|λήθ]]εια}} is "the state of not being hidden; the state of being [[evidence|evident]]." It also means factuality or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)lh/qeia|ἀλήθεια|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the opposite of [[lethe]], which literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lh/qh|λήθη|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pindar's Olympian Ode,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar Olympian Ode.11.6 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; Aletheia is the daughter of Zeus, while Aesop in his Fables&lt;ref&gt;Aesop, Fables 530 (from Phaedrus Appendix 5)&lt;/ref&gt; said that she was crafted by Prometheus.

==Heidegger and ''aletheia''==
{{Further information|World disclosure}}
[[File:Van-gogh-shoes.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting that reveals (''alethe'') a whole world.  Heidegger mentions this particular work of Van Gogh's in "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]".]]

In the early to mid 20th-century, [[Martin Heidegger]] brought renewed attention to the concept of ''aletheia'', by relating it to the notion of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], or the way in which things appear as entities in the world. While he initially referred to ''aletheia'' as "truth", specifically a form that is [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] in origin, Heidegger eventually corrected this interpretation, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To raise the question of ''aletheia'', of disclosure as such, is not the same as raising the question of truth. For this reason, it was inadequate and misleading to call ''aletheia'', in the sense of opening, truth."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 70, translation amended. The original in ''Zur Sache des Denkens'' (Tübingen: Max Niemayer, 1969), p. 86. Cited in [[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidegger gave an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis of ''aletheia'' and drew out an understanding of the term as 'unconcealedness'.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M.  "Parmenides". Translated by Andre Schuwer and Richard Rojcewicz, Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''aletheia'' is distinct from conceptions of truth understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs ([[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]]), or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole ([[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]]).  Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an [[ontology|ontological]] "world" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.

Heidegger also wrote that "''Aletheia'', disclosure regarded as the opening of presence, is not yet truth. Is ''aletheia'' then less than truth? Or is it more because it first grants truth as ''adequatio'' and ''certitudo'', because there can be no presence and presenting outside of the realm of the opening?"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 69, translation amended. Cited in Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger began his discourse on the reappropriation of ''aletheia'' in his magnum opus, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. ''Being and Time''. translated by Joan Stambaugh, Albany, State University of New York Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on the concept in his ''Introduction to Metaphysics''. For more on his understanding of ''aletheia'', see ''Poetry, Language, and Thought'', in particular the essay entitled "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]", which describes the value of the work of art as a means to open a "clearing" for the appearance of things in the world, or to disclose their meaning for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;According to Heidegger, art "gives things their look, and human beings their outlook." From "The Origin of the Work of Art."&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger revised his views on ''aletheia'' as truth, after nearly forty years, in the essay "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking," in ''On Time and Being''.

The term '''analogue''' is used in [[literary history]] in two related senses:&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;[https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html Literary Terms and Definitions: A], Analog&lt;/ref&gt;
* a work which resembles another in terms of one or more [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s, [[Fictional character|characters]], scenes, phrases or events.
* an individual motif, character, scene, event or phrase which resembles one found in another work.

Similarities may be fortuitous, in which case the merit of establishing an analogue is that it makes it possible to see how works from different authors (perhaps also in different languages, periods, genres) treat similar characters or motifs. But the term is used  particularly in the study of [[legend]]s, [[Fairy tale|folk tale]]s and [[oral literature]] for works that have features in common either because they derive from a shared tradition or because they both rework material from a specific older text, which may or may not still survive.

For example, some claim the story of Noah and the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] in the [[Bible]] and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] are analogues.&lt;ref name="wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06576.html Encyclopedia Judaica: The Flood]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, where one work draws directly on another, the term ''analogue'' is inappropriate: the earlier work is the ''source'' of the later.

In the literature of earlier periods, it may not be easy to decide whether a particular work is a direct source for another, especially if there are uncertainties of dating. The phrase ''sources and analogues'' is used to cover ''all'' material relevant to the creation of a particular work.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/courses/Sources.html Old English Sources and Analogues]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animal bite''' is a [[wound]], usually a puncture or laceration, caused by the teeth. An animal bite usually results in a break in the skin but also includes contusions from the excessive pressure on body tissue from the bite. The contusions can occur without a break in the skin. Bites can be provoked or unprovoked. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. &lt;!--Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]. get a citation for this statement --&gt; Biting is a physical action not only describing an attack but it is a normal response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes [[ectoparasites]] from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and mortality. Animal bites not only include injuries from the teeth of reptiles, mammals, but fish, and amphibians. Arthropods can also bite and leave injuries.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms
*Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching
*Serious [[hemorrhage]] if major blood vessels are pierced
*[[Infection]] by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or other [[pathogen]]s, including rabies
*Introduction of [[Venom (poison)|venom]] into the wound by venomous animals such as some [[snakes]]
*Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing [[inflammation]] and [[itching]]

==Classification==

Bites are usually classified by the type of animal causing the wound.
Many different animals are known to bite humans.

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Jaw of the piranha.jpg|thumb|Jaw of the piranha with biting equipment displayed]]
*Companion animals, including [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[companion parrot|parrots]], may bite humans.
*[[Wildlife]] may sometimes bite humans. The bites of various mammals such as [[bat]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], [[raccoon]]s, etc. may transmit [[rabies]], which is almost always fatal if left untreated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Involuntary [[biting]] injuries due to [[closed-fist injuries]] from fists striking teeth (referred to as [[Reverse bite injury|reverse bite injuries]]) are a common consequence of [[Hand to hand combat|fist fights]]. These have been termed "fight bites". Injuries in which the [[knuckle joint]]s or [[tendon]]s of the hand are bitten into tend to be the most serious.

Teething infants are known to bite objects to relieve pressure on their growing teeth, and may inadvertently bite people's hands or arms while doing so. Young children may also bite people out of anger or misbehaviour, although this is usually corrected early in the child's life.

===Reverse bite injury===
A reverse bite injury (also called a clenched fist injury, closed fist injury, or fight bite) results when, a person punches another person in the face, and the skin (and sometimes tendons) of their knuckles are cut against the teeth of the person they are punching.&lt;ref name="PerronMiller2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/ajem.2002.31146 |title=Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: Fight bite |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–117 |year=2002 |last1=Perron |first1=Andrew D. |last2=Miller |first2=Mark D. |last3=Brady |first3=William J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the wound is often located over the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] resulting in tendon injury.&lt;ref name="HenryPurcell2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/emj.2006.045054 |pmid=17582031 |pmc=2658386 |title=The human bite injury: A clinical audit and discussion regarding the management of this alcohol fuelled phenomenon |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=455–458 |year=2007 |last1=Henry |first1=F. P. |last2=Purcell |first2=E. M. |last3=Eadie |first3=P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical treatment of this injury is similar to those of a [[Human biting injuries|human bite]], but may also involve damage of the underlying tendons.&lt;ref name="ShewringTrickett2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1753193415576249 |pmid=25770897 |title=The management of clenched fist 'fight bite' injuries of the hand |journal=Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume) |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=819–824 |year=2015 |last1=Shewring |first1=D. J. |last2=Trickett |first2=R. W. |last3=Subramanian |first3=K. N. |last4=Hnyda |first4=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These injuries should be managed as other human bites: wound irrigation and [[antibiotics]] are essential as human saliva can contain a number of bacteria.&lt;ref name="TalanAbrahamian2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/379331 |pmid=14614671 |title=Clinical Presentation and Bacteriologic Analysis of Infected Human Bites in Patients Presenting to Emergency Departments |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1481–1489 |year=2003 |last1=Talan |first1=D. A. |last2=Abrahamian |first2=F. M. |last3=Moran |first3=G. J. |last4=Citron |first4=D. M. |last5=Tan |first5=J. O. |last6=Goldstein |first6=E. J. C. |author7=Emergency Medicine Human Bite Infection Study Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these injuries is such that even if the injury is optimally managed, poor outcomes may still occur.&lt;ref name="PerronMiller2002"/&gt;

===Arthropods===
The bites of arthropods have some of the most serious health consequences known. Mosquito bites transmit serious disease and result in millions of deaths and illnesses in the world. Ticks also transmit many diseases such as [[Lyme disease]].

*[[Insect bites and stings]]
**[[Flea bite]]s are responsible for the transmission of [[Plague (disease)|plague]].
**[[Mosquito bite]]s are responsible for the transmission of [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]].
*[[Leech bite]]

==Mechanism==

=== Trauma ===
One of the first consequences of a bite is the trauma inflicted upon tissue. Some animals involved in inflicting bites are also receiving them during the confrontation. Trauma includes scratching of the skin surface, tooth loss, puncture wounds, superficial and deep lacerations, amputations, and the ripping off of skin and hair. If major blood vessels are damaged, severe blood loss can occur.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

=== Infection ===
Pathogen organisms can be introduced into the bite. Some of the pathogens can originate from the mouth of the 'biter', the substrate onto which the injured person or animal can fall or from the naturally occurring microorganisms that are present on the skin or hair of the animal. The advent of antibiotics improved the outcome of bite wound infections.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

===Rabies===
Animal bites where skin has been penetrated, most commonly dogs and [[bat]]s, transmit rabies to humans.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabies Fact Sheet N°99|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabies from other animals is rare.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; If the animal is caught alive or dead with its head preserved, the head can be analyzed to detect the disease. Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth, growling, self-mutilation, jerky behavior, red eyes, and [[Rabies#Hydrophobia|hydrophobia]].

If the animal cannot be captured, preventative rabies treatment is recommended in many places. Several countries are known not to have native rabies, see the Wikipedia page for [[Prevalence of rabies#Rabies-free jurisdictions|prevalence of rabies]].

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment includes washing the bite wound.&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal bites Fact sheet N°373|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a low risk of infection the wound may be sutured.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Debridement and drainage bite wounds was practiced in the pre-antibiotic era, but still had a high infection rate.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics to prevent infection are recommended for dog and cat bites of the hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1021 |title=Antibiotics in cat bites |website=BestBets }}&lt;/ref&gt; and human bites if they are more than superficial.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70110-0 |pmid=19555903 |title=Bite-related and septic syndromes caused by cats and dogs |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=439–447 |year=2009 |last1=Oehler |first1=Richard L. |last2=Velez |first2=Ana P. |last3=Mizrachi |first3=Michelle |last4=Lamarche |first4=Jorge |last5=Gompf |first5=Sandra |citeseerx=10.1.1.490.2232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also recommended in those who have [[immunodeficiency|poor immune function]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Evidence for antibiotics to prevent infection in bites in other areas is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001738 |pmid=11406003 |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD001738 |year=2001 |last1=Medeiros |first1=Iara Marques |last2=Saconato |first2=Humberto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first choice is [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]], and if the person is penicillin-allergic, [[doxycycline]] and [[metronidazole]].&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt; The antistaphylococcal penicillins (e.g., [[cloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[flucloxacillin]]) and the [[macrolide]]s (e.g., [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]]) are not used for empirical therapy, because they do not cover ''[[Pasteurella]]'' species.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt;

===Vaccinations===
Rabies prevention is generally available in [[North America]] and the [[Northern European]] states.

[[Tetanus toxoid]] treatment is recommended in those whose vaccinations are not up to date and have a bite that punctures the skin.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; [[Tetanus immune globulin]] is indicated in people with more than 10 years since prior vaccination. Tetanus boosters (Td) should be given every ten years.

{{main|Insect bites and stings}}

[[Antihistamines]] are effective treatment for the symptoms from bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1074 |title=BestBets: Oral antihistamines for insect bites |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[Dengue fever|dengue]] are transmitted by [[mosquitoes]].

== Epidemiology ==
Human bites are the third most frequent type of bite after dog and cat bites.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases – Animal and Human Bites, Morven S. Edwards | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4557-1177-2 }}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog bites]] are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html |title= Dog Bite Statistics |author = Kenneth M. Phillips |date= 2009-12-27 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4.7 million [[dog bite]]s are reported annually in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ Questions and Answers about Dog Bites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025320/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US estimated annual count of animal bites is 250,000 human bites, 1 to 2 million dog bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 45,000 bites from snakes. Bites from skunks, horses, squirrels, rats, rabbits, pigs, and [[monkey bite|monkey]]s may be up to 1 percent of bite injuries. Pet ferrets attacks that were unprovoked have caused serious facial injuries. Non-domesticated animals though assumed to be more common especially as a cause of rabies infection, make up less than one percent of reported bite wounds. When a person is bitten, it is more likely to occur on the right arm, most likely due to defensive reactions when the person uses their dominant arm. Estimates are that three quarters of bites are located on the arms or legs of humans. Bites to the face of humans constitute only 10 percent of the total. Two thirds of bite injuries in humans are suffered by children aged ten and younger.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

Up to three fourths of dog bites happen to those younger than 20 years-old. In the United States, the costs associated with dog bites are estimated to be more than $1 billion annually. The age groups that suffer most from dog bites are children 5 to 9 years-old. Often, bites go unreported and no medical treatment given - these bites go unreported. As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal bites. This is more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog bites are then admitted to the hospital. Bites typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Girls are bitten more frequently by cats than they are by dogs. Boys are bitten by dogs two times more often than girls are bitten by dogs.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

== History ==

The bites of humans are recorded during the biblical area. Reports of secondary infection occurring after a human bite in children have been noted in the United States since at least 1910. Morbidity and mortality rates improved with the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

[[Art theft]] and [[looted art|looting]] occurred on a massive scale during [[World War II]]. It originated with the policies of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries, primarily [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Japan]], which systematically looted occupied territories. Near the end of the war the [[Soviet Union]], in turn, began looting reclaimed and occupied territories. "The grand scale of looted artwork by the Nazis has resulted in the loss of many pieces being scattered across the world." (Minyard, 2007)

Although the looting of "cultural heritage" of the German people and private collectors was not permitted in the 1945 agreement of Yalta, following the defeat of Germany by the Allied forces the following goods disappeared: three truckloads of precious art, which was listed in a confiscated list by the US forces (in the mine Merker in Thuringia), and one trainload of 20 wagons loaded with artwork and jewels from Hungary (named the "gold train").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to a 2001 ''Der Spiegel'' article,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} the artwork is suspected to be in the US and has never been officially declared. The lost artworks from the "Grube Merker," about 450 pictures, are not found in any museum and thought to have been sold privately.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An attempt by the US to confiscate more German art by requesting 202 precious pictures to be taken was prevented by [[Walter Farmer]] on 6 November 1945, an art protection officer in Wiesbaden leading the central art collection store.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Although against his direct orders from the US, he assembled 24 colleagues from Germany and Austria and successfully prevented the removal of the pictures (named as operation "Westward Ho").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19438032.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Before his death in 1997, Farmer was awarded Germany's highest civilian honor, the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit, for his work in returning the 202 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Walter Farmer. The Economist; London Vol. 344, Iss. 8031, Anonymous (Aug 23, 1997): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Art as Politics in the Third Reich'' by [[Jonathan Petropoulos|Jonathan Petropoulus]] he outlines how there is a need for further cooperation by smaller art galleries to recover art that they may be holding and not know who it belongs to. He says that there are still many tens of thousands of pieces of art missing today, but there is still more research to be done to get a more accurate number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|last=Petropoulos|first=Jonathan|publisher=Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large plan was drafted by the Nazis for much of the stolen art to be featured in a so-called [[Fuhrermuseum|Führermuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism &lt;/ref&gt; which would display much of the art plundered by the Nazis. This museum would feature works that were not considered to be "[[degenerate art]]" and would instead solely focus on the aesthetics that Hitler considered to be "good", and was to be created in the city of [[Linz]]. However, this museum was never created, and much of the art that may have been on display there is still missing today.  The Nazis were so vehemently against the loss of the art that they had plundered for this museum that there was a plan to destroy a stockpile of art saved for the Führermuseum at the [[Altaussee]] salt mines, which held over 12000 pieces of stolen art, using eight 500-kilogram bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edsel |first1=Robert M. |title=The Monuments Men |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Hachette/Center Street |isbn=978-1-59995-149-2 |pages=303-306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless pieces of art were stolen during the Holocaust and many were destroyed.  The Nazis were relentless in their efforts to get rid of the Jewish people and their culture. Paintings that had been passed down from generation to generation were taken and destroyed. This was extremely emotionally hard for many Jewish families because it was not only an attack on their families and culture, but also on their history. There have barely been any efforts of restitution. Many of the families who lost art are simply now left with claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willi|first1=Korte|title=Nazi Looted Art: The Case of the Missing Perspective|journal=First Person Singular|date=September 1, 2006|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary problems encountered by individuals pursuing claims is that it is difficult to locate the necessary documentation on provenance. Organizations with information on a piece's history, museums in particular, often have a disincentive to share information that could assist in an heir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foulkes|first=Lucia|date=2015|title=The art of atonement: how mandated transparency can help return masterpieces lost during World War II|url=|journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7243">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Beck's monadicity theorem''' gives a criterion that characterises [[monadic functor]]s, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Beck|year=2003|authorlink=Jonathan Mock Beck}} in about 1964. It is often stated in dual form for [[comonad]]s.  It is sometimes called the '''Beck tripleability theorem''' because of the older term ''triple'' for a monad.

Beck's monadicity theorem asserts that a [[functor]]

:&lt;math&gt;U: C \to D&lt;/math&gt;

is monadic if and only if&lt;ref&gt;Pedicchio &amp; Tholen (2004) p.228&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''U'' has a left [[adjoint functors|adjoint]];
# ''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s; and
# ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of ''U''-split parallel pairs (those parallel pairs of morphisms in ''C'', which ''U'' sends to pairs having a split coequalizer in ''D''), and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.

There are several variations of Beck's theorem: if ''U'' has a left adjoint then any of the following conditions ensure that ''U'' is monadic:
*''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s and ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of reflexive pairs (those with a common right inverse)  and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.  (This gives the crude monadicity theorem.)
*Every fork in ''C'' which is by ''U'' sent to a split coequalizer sequence in ''D'' is itself a coequalizer sequence in ''C''. In different words, ''U'' creates (preserves and reflects) ''U''-split coequalizer sequences.

Another variation of Beck's theorem characterizes strictly monadic functors: those for which the comparison functor is an isomorphism rather than just an equivalence. For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism.

Beck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the [[descent (category theory)|descent theory]], which plays role in sheaf and stack theory, as well as in the [[Grothendieck]]'s approach to [[algebraic geometry]]. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of [[algebraic structure]]s (e.g. those in [[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique|FGA]] and in  [[Grothendieck's Séminaire de géométrie algébrique|SGA1]]) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via [[fibered category|fibered categories]] and [[descent data]] was shown (by Bénabou and Roubaud) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach. In a later work, [[Pierre Deligne]] applied Beck's theorem to [[Tannakian category]] theory, greatly simplifying the basic developments.

==Examples==

*It follows from Beck's theorem that the forgetful functor from compact Hausdorff spaces to sets is monadic. The left adjoint is the [[Stone–Čech compactification]], the forgetful functor preserves all colimits, and it reflects isomorphisms because any continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. The forgetful functor from topological spaces to sets is not monadic as it does not reflect isomorphisms.
*The powerset functor from Set&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to Set is monadic, where Set is the category of sets. More generally Beck's theorem can be used to show that the powerset functor from T&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to T is monadic for any topos T, which in turn is used to show that the topos T has finite colimits.
*The forgetful functor from semigroups to sets is monadic. This functor does not preserve arbitrary coequalizers, showing that some restriction  on the coequalizers in Beck's theorem is necessary if one wants to have conditions that are necessary and sufficient.
*If ''B'' is a faithfully flat commutative ring over the commutative ring ''A'' then the functor ''T'' from ''A'' modules to ''B'' modules taking ''M'' to ''B''⊗&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' is a comonad. This follows from the dual of Becks theorem, as the condition that ''B'' is flat implies that ''T'' preserves limits, while the condition that ''B'' is faithfully flat implies that ''T'' reflects isomorphisms. A coalgebra over ''T'' turns out to be essentially a ''B''-module with descent data, so the fact that ''T'' is a comonad is equivalent to the main theorem of faithfully flat descent, saying that ''B''-modules with descent are equivalent to ''A''-modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Deligne|1990|loc=§4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11155">The '''Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica''' was the library of the [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish community]] of [[Rome]], Italy. Established in the early 20th century, it housed approximately 7,000 rare or unique books and manuscripts dating back to at least the 16th century. According to the [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]], it was the most important Jewish library in Italy and one of the most important in the world. The contents of the library were looted by Nazi Germany shortly after the [[Raid of the Ghetto of Rome]] in October 1943, and have never been recovered. Two months later, the contents of the ''Collegio Rabbinico Italiano'', the Italian Rabbinical College's library located in the same building, were also looted; only part of the contents of the latter library have been recovered.

==Contents==
The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was set up in the early 20th century in rooms above the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] at [[Lungotevere De' Cenci]]. Its contents consisted of publications that had previously been held at one of the five synagogues of the Roman Ghetto or other locations in the Jewish community of Rome.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; The library of the Italian Rabbinical College, housed in the same building, had been transferred from [[Florence]] to Rome in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The latter was a teaching library of almost 10,000 volumes.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica contained many rare or unique books and manuscripts, dating back to at least the 16th century. No complete catalogue exists, but visiting scholars compiled some specific lists during visits before the war.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; It is estimated that the library contained a quarter of all the work of the [[Soncino family (printers)|Sconcinos]], Jewish Italian printers from the 16th century who later worked in [[Salonica]] and [[Constantinople]], as well as 16th-century works by [[Daniel Bomberg]], [[Alvise Bragadin]], and Nicollet. The library contained approximately 7,000 volumes in all.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; A partial catalogue was compiled by Jewish Italian historian [[Isaiah Sonne]] in 1935, who classified the contents into texts printed by the Sconcinos, manuscripts, incunabula, 16th-century oriental copies printed in Constantinople, and special specimens.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; Sonne, however, complained that he was allowed to see only the second-best items in the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The lack of a proper catalogue may have been inspired in part by a desire to protect the contents from destruction by the Catholic church which, historically, had done so before to Jewish publications.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]] quoted an expert, Attilio Milano, who stated in a letter that "no other Italian Jewish library had so many priceless books and very few outside Italy exceeded it".&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

==Looting==
With the [[Armistice of Cassibile|surrender of Italy]] on 8 September 1943, Germany occupied northern and central Italy, including the Italian capital, [[Rome]]. The libraries of the Jewish community in Rome soon attracted German attention. According to an eyewitness, two uniformed men visited the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and the Italian Rabbinical College library, located in the same building, on 30 September and 1 October 1943. One of the two introduced himself as a teacher of Hebrew at an institute in [[Berlin]], most likely Johannes Pohl from the [[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question]], who had fulfilled a similar role at the Jewish libraries in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

Attempts were made to receive support from the Fascist Italian government to retain the contents of the libraries in Italy, but these received no sympathy there.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

On 14 October 1943, two days before the raid on the Roman Ghetto, the contents of the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and parts of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken away. The remainder of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken on 23 and 24 December 1943.&lt;ref name="Report" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lootedart.com/MJ1UB9290391 |title=Activity Report of the Commission for the Recovery of the Bibliographic Heritage of the Jewish Community in Rome, looted in 1943 |date= |website= |publisher=The Central Register of Information on Looted Cultural Property|access-date=30 September 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few isolated books and prints survived the looting either by being hidden by members of the community or overlooked by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

Under the control of the German military administration, the contents of the library were loaded onto two railway cars by an Italian company and sent to Germany via Switzerland. A letter by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] (ERR) from 21 January 1944, most likely referring to the second load of loot, stated that it had been delivered to an institute in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; The priceless contents of the community library were of special interest to the Rosenberg organisation,&lt;ref name="Ghettorom" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gedenkorte-europa.eu/de_de/ghetto-rom.html |title=Ghetto Rom |publisher=Gedenkorte Europa 1939–1945 |date= |website= |access-date=30 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it had set up a special organisation, the ''Sonderkommando Italien'', for their activities in the country.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=167}}

The records of the correspondence of the ERR were destroyed by a bombing raid on Berlin in November 1943. The Italian commission trying to locate the library contents came to the conclusion that the first train in October did not go to Frankfurt but to Berlin, which would explain why some of the contents of the second train were found after the war.  None of the contents of the first train were ever recovered.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=171}}

==Fate of the contents==
Only part of the contents of the Rabbinical College library was recovered in 1947, consisting of 20 [[Incunable|incunabula]]. None of the material taken from the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was ever recovered.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

The most likely theory as to the fate of the library contents is that they were stored during the war in an area that became part of the postwar Occupation Zone of the Soviet Union. From there the contents were taken to the Soviet Union and could now possibly be located within the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; Theories that the contents of the library were either destroyed during a bombing raid on the train transporting it to Germany, or in Germany itself, have been considered but discounted as less likely.&lt;ref name="Mystery" &gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Frank|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194543/missing-jewish-books-of-rome |title=The Mystery of the Missing Jewish Books of Rome |date= |publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|website= |access-date=3 October 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Italian government established a special commission to pursue the recovery of the contents of the library, carrying out research in a number of European countries. The commission looked into the possibility that the missing contents either went to Frankfurt, Berlin, or Frankfurt via Berlin. The Frankfurt option was seen as the less likely one as much of the looted books that had been stored there or at another deposit, at [[Hungen]], also in [[Hesse]], had fallen into the hands of American forces after the war and been returned, including prints from the Rabbinical College.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; It is estimated that that Nazi Germany looted up to 3 million books during World War II, of which 1.2 million were found at the end of the war at Hungen alone.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The more likely option was that the contents went to Berlin and either remained there or were evacuated to Ratibor, [[Silesia]] (now [[Racibórz]], Poland), where, at either place, they would eventually have come under control of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" &gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= |title=Activity Report on the activities of the commission for the recovery of the bibliographic patrimony of the Jewish community in Rome stolen in 1943 |url=http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/doc/rapporto_finale_eng.pdf |publisher=[[Government of Italy]] – [[Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]]|page= |docket= |access-date=3 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's research was complicated by the fact that two competing organisations existed in Nazi Germany which acquired looted Jewish publications with the aim of creating a library, the ''Amt Rosenberg'' (the ERR) and the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (the SS), the latter with the aim of using it as a source of information on their perceived enemy. As no records for the first transport of the loot are known to have survived, there is no certainty which of the two organisations received the two rail cars from October 1943. The commission's research in Russia was also hampered by the fact that certain archives were closed to it, such as the archive of the Russian [[Federal Security Service]].&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The lack of a proper catalogue has greatly hampered the recovery of the contents, as it is almost impossible to know what the library actually contained.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; In 1965, two Hebrew manuscripts with the stamp of the library were acquired by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary Library]] in New York, both of which were listed in the catalogue Sonne compiled in the 1930s. It is unclear how the manuscripts reached the United States and at what point after their cataloguing by Sonne in 1935 they were removed from the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; No details on the history of the two manuscripts between 1935 and 1965 could be established.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The ultimate fate of the library's contents remain a mystery, however, as all investigations, including that of the Italian government commission, have been inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=172}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29702">The '''Bilingual Education Act (BEA)''' ({{USStat|81|816}}), also known as '''Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967''' ({{USPL|90|247}}), approved by the [[90th United States Congress]] on January 2, 1968, and was the first [[United States]] [[Act of Congress|federal legislation]] recognized the needs of [[Limited English proficiency|limited English speaking ability]] (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] and was signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local [[school districts]] around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of [[Primary education in the United States|elementary]] and [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] school students not [[language proficiency|fluent]] in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in [[State school#United States|U.S. public education]]. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural implications==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
The BEA was a significant piece of education legislation. Its passage signaled "a shift from the notion that students should be afforded equal educational opportunity to the idea that educational policy should work to equalize academic outcomes, even if such equity demanded providing different learning environments."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010):408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it reflected changes in cultural perspectives towards diversity and immigration. The BEA was an important shift away from the late 1950s anticommunist sentiment where anything foreign was suspect, which had destroyed many earlier local and state attempts at bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it recognized that the federal government was responsible for educating immigrants to the US and opened doors for bilingual education projects on local, state, and federal levels.

Furthermore, this legislation, successfully enacted into law largely thanks to the efforts of Spanish speakers, has become an important part of the "polemic between assimilation and multiculturalism" and the role that language education in our society.&lt;ref&gt;Wiese, Ann-Marie and Eugene E. Garcia. "The Bilingual Education Act: Language Minority Students and Equal Educational Opportunity." Bilingual Research Journal, 22 (1998):3.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the BEA in its original form promoted celebrating linguistic and cultural differences and diversity in the U.S., it in many ways challenged assimilationist theories and the "melting pot" concept of the U.S. And yet, in its final form when passed, it did not mention the important link between language and culture, leaving the language vague.

The act additionally opened up a larger need for teachers who could teach language and other content within a language besides English.  This placed a strain on the teaching pool available in 1968 and even today there is a shortage of teachers for these highly specialized positions.   Culturally, it was argued in this time period that by teaching in a certain language it also taught specific values instead of just a way of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Armando "Bilingual Education and the Foreign Language Teacher." Paper presented at the National Convention of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (50th, San Antonio, Texas, August 28–30, 1968)., 8 (1968), http://search.proquest.com/docview/64405323&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and funding==
When Senator Yarborough introduced the bill to the Senate in 1967, he envisioned it as a way of addressing the "'poor performance in school and high dropout rates... and great psychological harm' caused by 'English-only policies, no Spanish-speaking rules, and cultural degradation'" that was evident in many schools at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peadbody Journal of Education, 85: 406, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the passage of the act was a bipartisan effort on behalf of Republicans and Democrats, it underwent significant changes between 1967 and 1968. Many of these changes were in the wording and framing of the act, which ultimately did not recognize the importance of biculturalism or the benefit of bilingualism or even the link between language and culture. Rather, it framed students of LESA as a "problem" that needed to be fixed. In addition, unlike what Yarborough had conceived, it provided no funding for permanent programs regarding students of LESA, as many people feared promoting a sense of entitlement in students and families benefitting from the act.

The BEA provided school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. The grants that the act provided were given directly to school districts and were to be used to buy resources for educational programs, to train teachers and teachers' aides, to develop and distribute materials and to create meaningful parental involvement projects. Although the act did not require the use of bilingual instruction or the use of a student's native language, its aim was to encourage innovative programs designed to teach students English. The act also gave school districts the opportunity to provide bilingual education programs without violating segregation laws, but at this time, participation was voluntary. Program effectiveness was evaluated at the end of every year and successful programs were eligible to receive federal funding for up to five years.

Because the BEA funding was provided in the form of grants, most of the financial clout lay with local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs). However, the federal government limited the reach of these funds in a few significant ways. To begin with, from a simple framing standpoint, the original 1968 BEA did not include any mention of instruction in or maintenance of a student's native language, limiting the potential impact of the act.

From a financial perspective, the BEA was also limited. The only programs eligible for receiving funding were programs for children between the ages of 3 and 8. Because it was meant to redress the dropout issue, the act with this caveat on funding viewed high school students of LESA somewhat of a lost cause. In addition, the act did not fund any permanent programs for educating students of LESA, but only funding exploratory programs. As a result, it did not seek to truly address the burgeoning issue of how to educate students who were not English dominant. Lastly, the funds were at first reserved for communities whose average income was below the poverty line stated in the ESEA ($3,000 in 1968). This limitation on funding had the unfortunate side effect of framing the act as a somewhat of a handout to poor, Latino communities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to many of these limitations and the vague wording of much of the BEA, funding was limited in the first three years to $85 million. By 1972, "only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzala, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California. Peabody Journal of Education, 85: 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments to the Bilingual Education Act==

===1974 amendments===
The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was not specific and participation by school districts was voluntary. As a result, Civil rights activists argued that the rights of minority-language students were being violated under this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, three amendments were made to the original act in an attempt to clarify the intent and design of programs designated for the education of LESA students. There were two significant events that impacted these changes: the Lau V. Nichols case and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974.

''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a class-action suit brought against the San Francisco School District and alleged that due to their inability to speak English, there were 1,800 Chinese students who were being denied an equal education. In 1974, the Supreme Court overruled the ruling of the lower courts and determined that the same resources, teachers and curriculum did not imply that the education was equal for students who had a limited command of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Programs for English Language Learners: Lau v. Nichols|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|publisher=Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling, the Equal Education Opportunity Act was passed. By citing instructional programs as the means through which language barriers were to be broken, it effectively extended the Lau ruling to all students and school districts. Furthermore, school districts were required to have special programs for LESA students regardless of federal or state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=3|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments in 1974 served to do the following: 
* define "Bilingual Education Program" as one that provided instruction in English and in the native language of the student to allow the student to progress effectively through the educational system
* define the program's goal to prepare LESA students to participate effectively in the regular classroom as quickly as possible while simultaneously maintaining the native language and culture of the student
* create regional support centers of consultants and trainers to provide support to school systems
* stipulate capacity-building efforts by providing funds to school districts' efforts to expand curricula, staff and research for bilingual programs
Funding increased from $7.5 million in 1968 to $68 million and as a result, programs were able to impact 368,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=4|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978 amendments===
In 1978, further amendments were made to extend the act and broaden the definition of eligible students. Specifically, these amendments served to do the following:  
* emphasize the strictly transitional nature of native language instruction
* expand eligibility to students who are [[limited English proficient]] (LEP)
* permit  enrollment of English-speaking students in bilingual programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding increased from $68 million in 1974 to $135 million which was enough to provide funding for 565 school districts and for secondary programs including service centers, graduate school fellowships and training for undergraduate students interested in becoming bilingual educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=5|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 amendments===
In 1984, the Bilingual Education Act was further modified. The amendments enacted during this time served to: 
* increase the flexibility in the implementation of programs for LEP students by providing school districts with more autonomy and independence in deciding how these students should be taught
* allow school districts to apply for funding for different, innovative programs that best met the needs of their students&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law and Policy Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for these amendments was $139.4 million and there was a heavy emphasis placed on districts using the funding to build enough capacity to eventually be able to support LEP programs without federal government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=6|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 amendments===
The BEA was amended again in 1988. The changes this year served to:
* increase funding to state education agencies
* expand funding for "special alternative" programs
* create fellowship programs for professional training&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Funding for the 1988 amendments was $159 million, with regulations for how the money should be divided. Specifically, at least 60% should be spent developing programs and at least 25% of funds should be spent on training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Kajzajares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=9|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 reauthorization===
The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) reauthorization in 1994 maintained the same tenets as the original BEA,  introduced new grant categories, set up preference to programs promoting bilingualism, and took into account indigenous languages.  Overall, the premise of this addition was to introduce a more systemic reform.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiese|first=Ann-Marie|title=The Bilingual Education Act:Language minority students and equal educational opportunity|journal=Bilingual Research Journal|date=Winter 1998|pages=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/222023139|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Priority given to bilingualism programs: Though the Bilingual Education Act legislation did not prescribe specific instructional practices, it did provide a guide to help language minority students.  The 1994 reauthorization gave preference to grant applications that developed bilingual proficiency, which Local Education Agencies had the right to develop themselves based on the guidelines of the BEA.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*In the FY2000 691 Bilingual Education Instructional Service Grants were given out totaling just over $162 million.  The largest grants in FY2000 were given to the state of California and New York at approximately $58 million and $22.5 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio-O’Dea|first=Patricia|title=Bilingual Education:  An Overview|journal=CRS Report for Congress|date=June 2001|pages=12|url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/education/archive/bilingual.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1994 California Proposition 187 was introduced in order to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining state provided health care, social services and public education.  This was voted on by the public and became a law in November 1994.  Citizens challenged the constitutionality of this proposition and in March 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional and was taken away.  Though the law did not last, it impacted students who were ELL throughout the mid-to-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cerda|first=Natalie|title=Bilingual Education Legislative Timeline|year=2006|url=http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant court decisions==
*''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' was the first U.S. Supreme Court case that addressed American education of foreign-languages.  This case did away with a Nebraska law that prevented public and private schools from offering instruction in any language but English. '"The protection of the [U.S.] Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue," Supreme Court Justice James C. McReynolds wrote. The decision established the principle that parents have a constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children, including their education.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=BELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a case brought forward, in which Chinese-American students attending a public school in San Francisco alleged that the failure to provide bilingual instruction to all non-English speaking students violated their rights to education due to limited English comprehension.  The case did not create a specific remedy, yet in conjunction with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], ruled in favor of the students, thus expanding the rights of students with limited English proficiency.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joseph|title=Bilingual Education and the Law: An Overview|journal=Dissemination Center for Bilingual Bicultural Education|year=1976|pages=25|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/63668329|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Serna v. Portales was a case that dictated when a "substantial group" of students with limited English proficiency was present, bilingual education was required.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Aspira v. N.Y. Board of Education required testing for students in English and their native language in order to understand if they should receive additional services and bilingual education.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado stated that students should receive instruction in their native language and English until proficiency in English is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes v. School District No.1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189|(1973)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0413_0189_ZS.html| n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*Flores v. Arizona stated that Arizona must do more to fund instruction for ELL students.  The Arizona courts rejected tenets of the NCLB law that changed the services provided to ELL students.  This case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=ELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Castaneda v. Pickard in 1981 created a basis for pedagogically addressing Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students.  It required that districts have a plan for addressing LEP students, that schools provide qualified staff to implement that plan, and that the district has developed an effective evaluation protocol for the program.  Though this case did create a more structured plan pedagogically it did not require bilingual education programs to meet these same standards. "It required only that 'appropriate action to overcome language barriers' be taken through well implemented programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kerper Mora Ed.D|first=Jill|title=LEGAL HISTORY OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION: Federal Law|publisher=San Diego State University|date=Jan 26, 2005|url=http://www.moramodules.com/Pages/HistoryBE.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bilingual Education Act and No Child Left Behind==
No Child Left Behind (NCLB), passed in 2002, had a significant impact on bilingual education and the Bilingual Education Act in the United States due to its emphasis on high-stakes testing. As a result of NCLB and its emphasis on testing, the Bilingual Education Act was renamed the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act.

The name change alone of BEA under NCLB is significant in that it signals a shift in the philosophical approach to bilingual education. Essentially, even though the act still leaves with state and local educators the ability to choose from instructional methods, "the statement of purpose and accountability requirements make clear that the primary objective is English acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rachel F. "Bilingual Education Act: Equal Education Opportunities: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice. JRank. JRank. n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Under NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) "to critical assessments without adequate preparation."&lt;ref&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational POlicy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the ''Castenada v. Pickard'' court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, "This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational Policy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies "access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition.  The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language.  The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math.  The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States.  By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen 57% over the prior decade to approximately 5.1 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|title=English-Learners Pose Policy Puzzle |journal=Education Week|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/01/08/17ell.h28.html |date= 8 January 2009 |volume=28 |issue=17 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After NCLB was enacted it was shown that there were sufficient numbers of prospective teachers, yet there were insufficient numbers of these teachers entering certain fields.  Among these specializations were science, math, foreign languages, special education and namely bilingual education.  Several initiatives formed to specifically recruit teachers to these specialization fields and allowed for alternative certification paths.  These teacher shortages continue to exist today and are seen to a greater extent in high-poverty districts.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Roselia. "TEACHER QUALITY AS A PREDICTOR OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN URBAN SCHOOLS: A NATIONAL FOCUS." Educational Law Consortium Journal.  The Lamar University – Electronic Journal of Student Research (2006): 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act and NCLB say that the accommodations that it provides should be interpreted in concordance with federal civil rights laws.  "As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and federal civil rights officials, these provisions rely on terms like “affirmative steps” and “appropriate action” that give school districts the discretion to use a range of instructional approaches. As a result, under both Title VI and the EEOA, courts and federal enforcement agencies must decide on a case-by-case basis whether programs are in fact overcoming linguistic barriers to full participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moran, Rachel F.|title=Bilingual Education Act Equal Educational Opportunities Act, Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice |url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3644/Bilingual-Education-Act.html |date= 11 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy still remains highly debated at both the state and federal level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">In [[Marxism]], '''bourgeois nationalism''' is the practice by the [[ruling class]]es of deliberately dividing people by [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], or [[religion]], so as to [[distraction|distract]] them from initiating [[class conflict|class warfare]]. It is seen as a [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] [[strategy]] used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them (hence the Marxist slogan, ''[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]'').

[[File:Leonid Brezhnev Portrait (1).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonid Brezhnev]]]]
After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] government based its [[Nationality|nationalities]] policy ([[korenization]]) on the principles of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. According to these principles, all nations should disappear with time, and [[nationalism]] was considered a [[bourgeois]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100886.html Khiterer, V. (2004) 'Nationalism in the Soviet Union'], in ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'',  Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Report on the 50th anniversary of the formation of the [[USSR]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]] emphasized: "That is why Communists and all fighters for socialism believe that the main aspect of the national question is unification of the working people, regardless of their national origin, in the common battle against every type of oppression, and for a new social system which rules out exploitation of the working people."&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Brezhnev, ''The 50th Anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'', Moscow, 1972, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:LiuShaoqi_Colour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liu Shaoqi]]]]
''Bourgeois nationalism'' as a concept was discussed in China by [[Liu Shaoqi]] as follows:
{{quote|The exploitation of wage labour, competition, the squeezing out, suppressing and swallowing of rivals among the capitalists themselves, the resorting to war and even world war, the utilisation of all means to secure a monopoly position in its own country and throughout the world - such is the inherent character of the profit-seeking bourgeoisie. This is the class basis of bourgeois nationalism and of all bourgeois ideologies. [...]
The most vicious manifestations of the development of bourgeois nationalism include the enslavement of the colonial and semi-colonial countries by the imperialist powers, the First World War, the aggression of Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese warlords during the Second World War, and the schemes for the enslavement of the whole world undertaken by the international imperialist camp, headed by American imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaoqi|first1=Liu|title=Internationalism and Nationalism|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/liu-shaoqi/1952/internationalism_nationalism/ch01.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.

A region's climate is generated by the '''climate system''', which has five components: [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[lithosphere]], and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="IPCC glossary"&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes].

The climate of a location is affected by its [[latitude]], [[terrain]], and [[altitude]], as well as nearby [[body of water|water bodies]] and their currents. Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W. Thornthwaite|title=An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55–94|year=1948|jstor=210739}}&lt;/ref&gt; in use since 1948, incorporates [[evapotranspiration]] along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how [[climate change]] affects it. The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

[[Paleoclimatology]] is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from [[Proxy (climate)|proxy variables]] that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in [[lake beds]] and [[ice core]]s, and biotic evidence such as [[Dendrochronology|tree rings]] and coral. [[Climate model]]s are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in [[global warming]]. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, "a 3{{formatnum:}}°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological consequences of globalwarming: is the signal already|last=Hughes|first=Lesley|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIEE-20000201"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Leslie |title=Biological consequences of global warming: is the signal already apparent? |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |date=1 February 2000 |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=56–61 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Climate (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''klima'', meaning ''inclination'') is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Climate|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1|accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard averaging period is 30&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages |title=Climate averages |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher=Met Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706025040/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|2001]] glossary definition is as follows:

{{quote|''Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&amp;nbsp;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]. [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm Appendix I: Glossary.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126132100/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |date=2017-01-26 }} Retrieved on 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) describes climate "normals" as "reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered 'normal'. A Normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends."&lt;ref name="WMO data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Data and Data Related Products |website=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20141001233620/https%3A//www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WMO originated from the [[International Meteorological Organization]] which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929. At its 1934 [[Wiesbaden]] meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.&lt;ref name="WMO history"&gt;{{cite web | title=Commission For Climatology: Over Eighty Years of Service |year=2011 | publisher=World Meteorological Organization | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/documents/WMO1079_web.pdf |format=pdf |pp=6, 8, 10, 21, 26 | accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate classification==
[[File:World Köppen Classification (with authors).svg|alt=Map of world dividing climate zones, largely influenced by latitude. The zones, going from the equator upward (and downward) are Tropical, Dry, Moderate, Continental and Polar. There are subzones within these zones.|thumb|right|upright=1.8|&lt;center&gt;Worldwide Koppen climate classifications&lt;/center&gt;]]
There are several ways to [[Climate classification|classify climates]] into similar regimes. Originally, [[clime]]s were defined in [[Ancient Greece]] to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into ''genetic'' methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and ''empiric'' methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the [[relative frequency]] of different [[air mass]] types or locations within [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] weather disturbances. Examples of [[empirical|empiric]] classifications include [[climate zone]]s defined by [[plant hardiness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Arboretum]]. [http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/691p3mE0Q?url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html |date=2012-07-09 }} Retrieved on 2008-03-09&lt;/ref&gt; evapotranspiration,&lt;ref name="thorn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Thornthwaite Moisture Index|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Thornthwaite&amp;submit=Search|accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally the [[Köppen climate classification]] which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain [[biome]]s. A common shortcoming of these [[classification scheme]]s is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===
{{Main|Air mass}}
The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nqQXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Bergeron+classification+is+most+widely+accepted+form+of+air+mass+classification#v=onepage&amp;q=Bergeron%20classification%20is%20most%20widely%20accepted%20form%20of%20air%20mass%20classification&amp;f=false|title=Field behavior of chemical, biological, and radiological agents|last=Army|first=United States Dept of the|date=1969|publisher=Dept. of Defense] Depts. of the Army and the Air Force|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for [[tropical]], P for [[Polar region|polar]], A for [[Arctic]] or Antarctic, M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the [[atmosphere]]. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While air mass identification was originally used in [[weather forecasting]] during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1995&gt;{{cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–68|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]] (SSC). There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B) dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rainforest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[desert]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], and [[polar ice cap]].

'''Rainforests''' are characterized by high [[rainfall]], with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|1750|mm|in}} and {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. Mean monthly temperatures exceed {{convert|18|C|F}} during all months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Woodward.

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Arctic Climatology and Meteorology.

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term "climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface [[temperature]] known as [[global warming]]. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the [[United Nations]] [[UNFCCC|Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses "climate variability" for non-human caused variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |title=Glossary |work=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major [[ice age]]s. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by [[interglacial]] periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface [[albedo]], reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the [[continent]]s, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois State Museum (2002).

They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record|global mean surface temperature]], with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Climateprediction.net.

Climate forecasting is used by some scientists to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_2476_580_1063_43/http%3B/iriportal3.ldeo.columbia.edu%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/development/climate_activities/prediction/climate_forecasts/climate_forecasts_overview__introduction/cf_intro_learn_more.html{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explore [[cognitive bias]], one might train an animal to expect that a positive event follows one stimulus and that a negative event follows another stimulus. For example, on many trials, if the animal presses lever A after a 20&amp;nbsp;Hz tone it gets a highly desired food, but a press on lever B after a 10&amp;nbsp;Hz tone yields bland food. The animal is then offered both levers after an intermediate test stimulus, e.g. a 15&amp;nbsp;Hz tone. The hypothesis is that the animal's "mood" will bias the choice of levers after the test stimulus; if positive, it will tend to choose lever A, if negative it will tend to choose lever B. The hypothesis is tested by manipulating factors that might affect mood – for example, the type of housing the animal is kept in.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harding|first1=EJ|last2=Paul|first2=ES|last3=Mendl|first3=M|year=2004|title=Animal behaviour: cognitive bias and affective state|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6972|pages=312|doi=10.1038/427312a|pmid=14737158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendl et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mendl, M.|author2=Burman, O.H.P.|author3=Parker, R.M.A.|author4=Paul, E.S.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2009|title=Cognitive bias as an indicator of animal emotion and welfare: emerging evidence and underlying mechanisms|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=118|pages=161–181|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rats==
In what has been described as a "landmark study",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=1008–1015|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.204|title=Ambiguous-cue interpretation is biased under stress- and depression-like states in rats.|author=Enkel, T.|author2=Gholizadeh, D.|author3=von Bohlen und Halbach, O. |author4=Sanchis-Segura, C.|author5=Hurlemann, R.|author6=Spanage, R.|author7=Gass P.|author8=Vollmayr, B.|lastauthoramp=y|pmid=20043002|pmc=3055368}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first study of cognitive bias in animals was conducted with rats.  This showed that laboratory rats in unpredictable environments had a more pessimistic attitude than rats in predictable environments.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

One study on rats investigated whether changes in light intensity – a short-term manipulation of emotional state – has an effect on cognitive bias.  Light intensity was chosen as a treatment because this specifically relates to anxiety-induction. Rats were trained to discriminate between two different locations, in either high ('H') or low ('L') light levels. One location was rewarded with palatable food and the other with aversive food. Rats switched from high to low light levels (putatively the least negative [[emotional manipulation]]) ran faster to all three ambiguous locations than rats switched from low to high light levels (putatively the most negative manipulation).&lt;ref name="Burman 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=98|issue=3|year=2009|pages=345–350|title=Anxiety-induced cognitive bias in non-human animals|author1=Burman, O.H.P.|author2=Parker, R.M.A.|author3=Paul, E.S.|author4=Mendl, M.T.|lastauthoramp=y|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study investigated whether chronic [[social defeat]] makes rats more pessimistic. To induce chronic [[psychosocial]] stress, rats were subjected to daily social defeat in a resident–intruder paradigm for three weeks. This chronic psychosocial [[psychological stress|stress]] makes rats more pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronic psychosocial stress makes rats more 'pessimistic' in the ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm|author=Papciaka, J.|author2=Popika, P.|author3=Fuchsc, E.|author4=Rygula, R.|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=256|year=2013|pages=305–310|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2013.08.036|pmid=23993861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the cognitive bias approach, it has been found that rats which are subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation (tickling) showed different responses to the intermediate stimulus: rats exposed to tickling were more optimistic.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|
first1=R|last1=Rygula|first2=H|last2=Pluta|last3=P|first3=Popik|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|pmc=3530570|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors stated that they had demonstrated "...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model".

==In pet dogs==
Up to five million pet dogs in the UK, approximately 50% of the population, may perform undesirable separation-related behaviour when left home alone.  Dogs were trained to move from a start position to a food bowl. When the bowl was on one side of the room ('positive' location, P) it contained a small quantity of food, and when on the opposite side ('negative' location, N) it was empty.  In test trials, the bowl (empty) was placed at one of three ambiguous locations between P and N (near-positive (NP), middle (M), or near-negative (NN).  Three test trials were presented at each location. The researchers measured how quickly the dogs moved to the ambiguous locations, fast indicating anticipation of food (an 'optimistic' judgement) or more slowly (a 'pessimistic' judgement).{{clarify|date=January 2018}}  These cognitive bias tests show that dogs which exhibit high levels of separation-related behaviour in a separation test also have a more negative underlying mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mendl, M.|author2=Brooks, J.|author3= Basse, C.|author4=Burman, O.|author5=Paul, E.|author6=Blackwell, E.|author7=Casey, R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Dogs showing separation-related behaviour exhibit a 'pessimistic' cognitive bias|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=19|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.030 |year=2010|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982210010201/1-s2.0-S0960982210010201-main.pdf?_tid=dca3e6e0-ad47-11e4-bc9f-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423148668_0e54a842bf173b32ae557174ec0bb5f2|pages=R839–R840|pmid=20937467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pigs==
Domestic pigs do not appear to develop a cognitive bias when kept in different stocking densities.  Farmed pigs trained to expect food inside a bowl in one location and not in another, and then tested to show their responses to ambiguous spatial locations. Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test.  Tests on three occasions for each pig did not reveal any difference in cognitive bias according to the pig's history of stocking density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=153|year=2014|pages=26–35|title=Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?|author1=Scolloa, A. |author2=Gottardob F. |author3=Contierob B. |author4=Edwards, S.A. |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2014.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study shows that restriction of [[Collared peccary|collared peccaries]] (''Pecari tajacu'') in metabolism pens affects their emotional state and increases feacal [[glucocorticoid]] (a stress hormone) [[metabolite]] concentrations.  The researchers noted that  these effects were mitigated by [[Behavioural enrichment|environmental enrichment]].&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oliveira, F.R.M.|author2=Sérgio L.G.|author3= Nogueira-Filho, S.L.G.|author4= Sousa, M.B.C.|author5=Dias, C.T.S.|author6=Mendl, M.|author7=Nogueira, S.S.C.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2016.05.021|volume=181|pages=76–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In honeybees==
[[File:Honeybee-27527-1.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken]]
Honeybees (''[[Apis mellifera carnica]]'') were trained to extend their [[proboscis]] to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M [[sucrose]]) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M [[quinine]] solution or 0.3 M sucrose).  Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. This shaking reduced levels of [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] in the [[hemolymph]] of a separate group of honeybees at a time point corresponding to when the cognitive bias tests were performed. In honeybees, octopamine is the local [[neurotransmitter]] that functions during reward learning, whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odours with quinine punishment.  If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently.

Within 5 minutes of the shaking, all the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odour stimuli presented in a random order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odours composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odour. Therefore, agitated honeybees display an increased expectation of bad outcomes similar to a vertebrate-like emotional state.  The researchers of the study stated that, "Although our results do not allow us to make any claims about the presence of negative subjective feelings in honeybees, they call into question how we identify emotions in any nonhuman animal. It is logically inconsistent to claim that the presence of pessimistic cognitive biases should be taken as confirmation that dogs or rats are anxious but to deny the same conclusion in the case of honeybees."&lt;ref name="Bateson"&gt;{{cite journal|

In mathematics, the '''Courant minimax principle''' gives the [[eigenvalue]]s of a real [[symmetric matrix]]. It is named after [[Richard Courant]].

==Introduction==

The Courant minimax principle gives a condition for finding the eigenvalues for a real symmetric matrix. The Courant minimax principle is as follows:

For any real symmetric matrix ''A'',
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k=\min\limits_C\max\limits_{{\| x\| =1}, {Cx=0}}\langle Ax,x\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is any (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix.

Notice that the vector ''x'' is an [[eigenvector]] to the corresponding eigenvalue&amp;nbsp;''λ''.

The Courant minimax principle is a result of the maximum theorem, which says that for ''q''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;''Ax'',''x''&amp;gt;, ''A'' being a real symmetric matrix, the largest eigenvalue is given by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = max&lt;sub&gt;||''x''||=1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''(''x'') = ''q''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding eigenvector. Also (in the maximum theorem) subsequent eigenvalues ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and eigenvectors ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are found by induction and orthogonal to each other; therefore, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;max&amp;nbsp;''q''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) with &amp;lt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt; = 0, ''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''.

The Courant minimax principle, as well as the maximum principle, can be visualized by imagining that if ||''x''|| =&amp;nbsp;1 is a [[hypersphere]] then the matrix ''A'' deforms that hypersphere into an [[ellipsoid]]. When the major axis on the intersecting [[hyperplane]] are maximized &amp;mdash; i.e., the length of the quadratic form ''q''(''x'') is maximized &amp;mdash; this is the eigenvector, and its length is the eigenvalue. All other eigenvectors will be perpendicular to this.

The minimax principle also generalizes to eigenvalues of positive self-adjoint operators on [[Hilbert space]]s, where it is commonly used to study the [[Sturm–Liouville problem]].

{{About|Devas in [[Jainism|Jainist]] teachings|other uses|Deva (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddesses amongst the Jains. Worship of such persons is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief and many Jains unknowingly get involved in such worship.]]
{{Jainism}}
The ''sanskrit'' word '''Deva''' has multiple meanings in Jainism. In many places the word has been used to refer to the ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (spiritual teachers of Dharma). But in common usage it is used to refer to the heavenly beings. These beings are born instantaneously in special beds without any parents just like [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]] beings (''naraki'').{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, clairvoyance (''avadhi jnana'') based on birth is possessed by the celestial beings.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=9}}

== Classes of Heavenly beings ==

According to Jain texts, the celestial beings are of four orders (classes):{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}-
* ''Bhavanavasi'' (residential)
* ''Vyantara'' (intermediaries or peripatetic)
* ''Joytiska'' (luminaries or stellar)
* ''Vaimanika'' (Astral or heavenly beings)

There are of ten, eight, five and twelve classes up to the Heavenly beings (''kalpavasis'').{{further explanation needed|date=April 2017}} There are ten grades in each of these classes of celestial beings, the Lord (Indra), his Equal, the Minister, the courtiers, the bodyguards, the police, the army, the citizens, the servants, and the menials.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=52}}

==Abode==
{{main|Heaven#Jainism}}
The abode of Devas is ''Svarga'' (heaven).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, persons with right faith (except those whose bondage of life-karma has been accomplished prior to their attainment of right belief) are reborn among the fourth order of ''devas'' and not among the three lower orders, namely the Residential, the Peripatetic and the Stellar ''devas''. Those practising restraint with attachment and restraint-cum-non-restraint are also characterized by right belief. Hence they are reborn in the higher heavens of ''Saudharma Kalpa'' and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}} Merit which leads to the highest celestial state such as  ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' is said to be acquired in the ''Bharata'', ''Airāvata'', and ''Videha Kshetra''{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}}

== Lifetime ==
1. Minimum lifetime of the Residential ''devas'' is ten thousand years.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=127}}
2. Peripatetic ''devas'' is a little over one ''palyopama''.
3.&amp;nbsp;Stellar ''devas'' same as Peripatetic ''devas''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1745">In [[topology]], a '''dispersion point''' or '''explosion point''' is a point in a topological space the removal of which leaves the space highly disconnected.

More specifically, if ''X'' is a [[connected space|connected topological space]] containing the [[point (geometry)|point]] ''p'' and at least two other points, ''p'' is a dispersion point for ''X'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;X\setminus \{p\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[totally disconnected]] (every subspace is disconnected, or, equivalently, every connected component is a single point). If ''X'' is connected and &lt;math&gt;X\setminus \{p\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[totally separated]] (for each two points ''x'' and ''y'' there exists a clopen set containing ''x'' and not containing ''y'') then ''p'' is an explosion point.  A space can have at most one dispersion point or explosion point. Every totally separated space is totally disconnected, so every explosion point is a dispersion point.

The [[Knaster–Kuratowski fan]] has a dispersion point; any space with the [[particular point topology]] has an explosion point.

If ''p'' is an explosion point for a space ''X'', then the totally separated space &lt;math&gt;X\setminus \{p\}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''pulverized''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15088">Over the years, as countries and regions around the world began to [[Economic development|develop]], it slowly became evident that [[industrialization]] and economic growth come hand in hand with [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name= huppes/&gt; '''Eco-Efficiency''' has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name= yadong/&gt; It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and [[pollution]]. “It is measured as the ratio between the (added) value of what has been produced (e.g. GDP) and the (added) environment impacts of the product or service (e.g. S02 emissions).”&lt;ref name= yadong /&gt; The term was coined by the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) in its 1992 publication “Changing Course,” and at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], eco-efficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement [[Agenda 21]] in the private sector.&lt;ref name= oecd/&gt; Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards [[sustainability]], combining [[ecological]] and [[economic efficiency]].&lt;ref name= oecd /&gt;

==History==
{{POV-section|date=September 2018}}

Although eco-efficiency is a rather new method, the idea is not. In the early 1970s [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]] developed the lettering formula [[I = PAT]] to describe the [[Human impact on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].&lt;ref name= ehren/&gt; Furthermore, the concept of eco-efficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McIntyre | first1 = R. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J. | year = 1978 | title = On the environmental efficiency of economic systems | url = | journal = Soviet Studies | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 173–192 | doi=10.1080/09668137808411179}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn’t until 1992, when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by [[Stephan Schmidheiny]] in ‘’Changing Course’’.&lt;ref name= ehren /&gt; Schmidheiny set out “to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part—a key part—of the solution for sustainability and global development.”&lt;ref name= wbcsd/&gt; The major drivers in the early phase of eco-efficiency’s development were the “forward-looking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow.”&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; It was their involvement which catapulted eco-efficiency from a brilliant idea to a workable concept. The results of the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development|WBCSD]]’s work creating the “linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value.”&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt;

==Methods==

According to the WBCSD definition, eco-efficiency is achieved through the delivery of "competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring [[quality of life]] while progressively reducing [[environmental impact]]s of goods and [[resource intensity]] throughout the entire life-cycle to a level at least in line with the Earth's estimated [[carrying capacity]]."&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; 
It works by implementing 4 main types of [[ratios]]. 
: “The first two are environmental productivity and its inverse, environmental intensity of production, referring to the realm of production. The second pair, environmental improvement cost and its inverse, environmental [[cost-effectiveness]], are defined from an environmental improvements measures point-of-view.”&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt;
The ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value, “and having some physical substrate, always influence the environment.”&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt;&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; Furthermore, there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios: ‘’micro’’ and ‘’macro’’. 
There are three different methods to determine eco-efficiency at the micro-level. First, ‘’incremental eco-efficiency’’, which “specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects.”&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt; Second, an analysis method nicknamed ‘’win-win’’, which “gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies.”&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt;&lt;ref name= guns/&gt; It should be noted that the win-win micro-method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is ‘’difference eco-efficiency’’, which is similar to the win-win variant, but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives.&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt;
Now the macro-level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However,  “the ultimate aim of eco-efficiency analysis is to help move micro-level decision making into macro-level optimality.”&lt;ref name= huppes /&gt;&lt;ref name= oecd /&gt;&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro-level analysis at a country/world scale.&lt;ref name= oecd /&gt;&lt;ref name= iisd /&gt;

There are two [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA) -based calculation systems on eco-efficiency: the Analysis Method of BASF, and the method of the [[Eco-costs value ratio]] of the Delft University of Technology.

==Uses==

The reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in [[resource productivity]], which in turn can create a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name= iisd/&gt; 
According to the WBCSD, critical aspects of eco-efficiency are:&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt;&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;Lovins, L. Hunter (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_3.pdf Rethinking production] in ''State of the World 2008'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A reduction in the material intensity of goods or services;
* A reduction in the [[energy intensity]] of goods or services;
* Reduced dispersion of toxic materials;
* Improved [[recyclability]];
* Maximum use of renewable resources;
* Greater [[durable goods|durability]] of products;
* Increased service intensity of goods and services.
Strategies that have been linked to eco-efficiency include “Factor 4” and “[[Factor 10]]”, which call for specific reductions in resource use,  “natural capitalism”, which incorporates eco-efficiency as part of a broader strategy, and the “[[cradle-to-cradle]]” movement, which claims to go beyond eco-efficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste. According to Boulanger,&lt;ref&gt;http://sapiens.revues.org/index1022.html Boulanger, P.M. (2010) "Three strategies for sustainable consumption". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''3''' (2)&lt;/ref&gt; all versions of eco-efficiency share four key characteristics:
* Confidence in [[technological innovation]] as the main solution to un-sustainability;
* Reliance on business as the principal [[Actor–network theory|actor]] of transformation. The emphasis is on firms designing new products, shifting to new production processes, and investing in R&amp;D, etc., more than on the retailer or the consumer, let alone the citizen.
* Trust in [[Market economy|markets]] (if they are functioning well);
* “Growthphilia”: there is nothing wrong with [[economic growth|growth]] as such.

The view that improvements in eco-efficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover, with “cradle-to-cradle”, growth is conducive to sustainability per se.
This broader concept is called ‘’Sustainable Production and Consumption’’ (SPC). “This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of [[natural resources]];” &lt;ref name= iisd /&gt; business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. Eco-efficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref name= ehren /&gt; making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues.&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt;

===Examples===
{{POV-section|date=September 2018}}

Furthermore, eco-efficiency is also a very useful tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies, while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies.&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; For example, larger national players such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD 2002),  [[European Commission]] (EU 2005), [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) and the [[National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy]] (NRTEE) have all recognized that eco-efficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives.&lt;ref name= yadong /&gt;&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt;&lt;ref name= iisd /&gt;&lt;ref name= baker/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrtee&gt;Government of Canada. (2011, October 06). Eco-efficiency. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ee-ee.nsf/eng/h_ef00010.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206125255/http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ee-ee.nsf/eng/h_ef00010.html |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven to heighten market values for firms,&lt;ref name= guns /&gt;&lt;ref name= accounting/&gt; serve as an effective management tool for governments, benefit civil society, and increase quality of life.  “It does this by changing industrial processes, creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules.”&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt; More people aim to get more value for their money in the market, while also enjoying a better environment.

Recently, there has also been use of eco-efficiency in more non-traditional ways, such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their credit-approval process; looking at “eco-integrated economic risks of a customer.”&lt;ref name= iisd2/&gt; And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where, “eco-efficient choices are always preferred,”&lt;ref name= ehren /&gt; especially in service sectors such as [[tourism]].&lt;ref name= wbcsd /&gt;

Rather than try to make products that can be marketed as ethical in their own right, such as “fair trade” goods, firms are increasingly trying to take an ordinary product and boost its moral credentials with embedded generosity&lt;ref name="Give and take"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3379">The '''epistemic virtues,''' as identified by [[virtue epistemology|virtue epistemologists]], reflect their contention that belief is an ethical process, and thus susceptible to the intellectual [[virtue]] or [[vice]] of one's own life and personal experiences. Some epistemic virtues have been identified by [[W. Jay Wood]], based on research into the [[medieval]] tradition. 

==Overview==
Being an epistemically virtuous person is often equated with being a [[critical thinking|critical thinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, M., &amp; Trout, J. D.  2004.  ''Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the human agent and the kind of practices that make it possible to arrive at the best accessible approximation of the truth.{{R|"Pigliucci"}}

Epistemic virtues include [[conscientiousness]]&lt;ref&gt;Greco, John. 2011. {{cite SEP |url-id=epistemology-virtue |title=Virtue Epistemology}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the following:{{R|"Pigliucci"}}
* attentiveness
* benevolence (principle of charity)
* [[creativity]]
* [[curiosity]] [see below]
* [[discernment]]
* [[honesty]]
* [[humility]]
* [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]
* [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]
* studiousness
* [[understanding]]
* warranty
* [[wisdom]]

These can be contrasted to the ''epistemic vices'' such as:
* closed-mindedness
* curiosity [see below]
* [[dogma]]tism
* epistemic blindness
* [[folly (disambiguation)|folly]]
* [[gullibility]]
* [[intellectual dishonesty]]
* obtuseness
* self-deception
* [[superficiality]] of thought
* [[superstition]]
* willful naïveté
* [[wishful thinking]]

Note that in this context ''curiosity'' bears the medieval connotation of attraction to unwholesome things, in contrast to the positive ''studious'' (or perhaps ''inquisitive'').

[[File:FMtreew.gif|thumb|Function means tree]]

In [[engineering design]], a '''function–means tree''' (a.k.a. '''function/means tree''' or '''F/M tree''') is a method for [[functional decomposition]] and concept generation. At the top level, main functions are identified. Under each function, a [[instrumental value|means]] (or solution element) is attached. Alternative [[solution]] elements can also be attached. Each means is in turn decomposed into functions with means attached to each of them. A well-elaborated function means tree span, a design space where all [[concept]]s under consideration are represented. Requirements can be attached to functions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In addition to product level requirements, there might be requirements on sub functions that may be a consequence of means at a higher level. The function means tree is a tool that can aid in the [[creativity|creative]] part of the design process. It can also be a tool for mapping requirements to parts in a design. This requires that there be also a mapping between means and parts in the product [[architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

'''Gayane Khachaturian''' ({{lang-hy|Գայանե Խաչատրյան}}) (May 9, 1942 – May 1, 2009) was a [[Georgian people|Georgian]]-[[Armenian people|Armenian]] painter and graphic artist.

==Biography==

Gayane Khachaturian was born into an Armenian family in [[Tbilisi]], capital of Georgia, and studied art at the Nikoladze Art School. She became seriously involved in the art scene after graduating from the Secondary School of Working Youth in 1960. She met [[Sergei Parajanov]] in 1967 at [[Elene Akhvlediani]]'s house and they maintained a close friendship which lasted until his death. Some of Khachaturian’s works are permanently exhibited at the [[Yerevan]] Museum of Modern Art, the [[National Gallery of Armenia]], [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] in Yerevan as well as are in a number of private collections, including those owned by Valerie Khanukaev, Bagrat Nikogosyan, and Artashes Aleksanyan. When she was alive, her tiny studio on Bakinskaya Street had become a tourist attraction. According to Russian art critic Vitaly Patsyukov, "Khachaturian is among those pioneers of new artistic consciousness who draw into their focus all phenomenal aspects of European 'actual view' and the radical sensuousness and natural freedom of plastic gesture." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accea.info/images/pdf/09_05N2_Gayane_Catalog_on_A4.pdf Gayane Khachaturian's Catalog, Armenian Pavilion, 53rd International Art Exhibition la Biennale di Venezia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khachaturian died on May 1, 2009 and is buried in the [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi]] ([[Khojivank]]).

{{literature}}

The term '''''hamartia''''' derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν ''hamartánein'', which means "to miss the mark" or "to err".&lt;ref&gt;"Hamartia". ''Merriam-Webster.com''. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamartia: (Ancient Greek: ἁμαρτία) Error of Judgement or Tragic Flaw. "Hamartia". ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often associated with [[Greek tragedy]], although it is also used in [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene J. "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" ''Laval théologique et philosophique''. 29.3 (1973) 243–255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Hamartia'' as it pertains to [[Play (theatre)|dramatic literature]] was first used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In [[tragedy]], ''hamartia'' is commonly understood to refer to the [[protagonist|protagonist’s]] error or '''tragic flaw''' that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad.  

What qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a [[wrongdoing]]. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.

== In Aristotle's ''Poetics'' ==
[[File:6Parts Image.pdf|thumb|A list of 
the six parts of Aristotle's Greek tragedy]]
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|"Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure"—click to view a larger version]]
Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The source of ''hamartia'' is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by [[Aristotle]].

{{quote|Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e. the sort of thing they seek or avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of ''Poetics'', [[Francis Fergusson]] describes ''hamartia'' as the inner quality that initiates, as in [[Dante|Dante's]] words, a "movement of spirit" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.htmlThe Internet Classics Archive] by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Jules Brody, however, argues that "it is the height of [[irony]] that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of ''hamartia''.  Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, [[Immoral|moral deficiency]], or the like.  ''Hamartia'' is a morally neutral non-[[normative]] term, derived from the verb ''hamartano'', meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'.  And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite.  ''Hamartia'' may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information.  Finally, ''hamartia'' may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success."&lt;ref&gt;Jules Brody, "Fate, Philology, Freud," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 38.1 (April 2014): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Greek tragedy]], for a story to be "of adequate magnitude" it involves characters of high rank, [[reputation |prestige]], or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes ''hamartia'' as the quality of a [[tragic hero]] that generates that optimal balance.

{{quote|...the character between these two extremes&amp;nbsp;– that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Christian theology ==
{{Main |Hamartiology}}
''Hamartia'' is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]]. The Hebrew (''chatá'') and its Greek equivalent (''àµaρtίa''/''hamartia'') both mean "missing the mark" or "off the mark".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2398&amp;t=KJV Strong's]'', bibclassic.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G266 Strong's]'', blueletterbible.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miss+the+mark Legal Dictionary]'', thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are four basic usages for ''hamartia'': 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes used to mean acts of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] "by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions" as in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5:12, "all have sinned".&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes applied to the [[fall of man]] from original righteousness that resulted in humanity's innate propensity for sin, that is [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" in ''Laval théologique et philosophique.'' 29.3 (1973) 243-255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014 and&lt;br/&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as in Romans 3:9, everyone is "under the power of sin".&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# A third application concerns the "weakness of the flesh" and the free will to resist sinful acts. "The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from ''the weakness of the flesh''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Fifty Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions'' (J. Heptinstall for Henry Mortlock, 1707), 525. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=kSVWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22weakness+of+the+flesh%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s &lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes "personified".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromiley, ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'' (Eerdmans, 1985), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to ''hamartia'' (sin).

== Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention ==
[[Aristotle]] mentions ''hamartia'' in ''Poetics''. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (''hamartia''). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as ''tragic flaw'' or ''tragic error''.

===Critical argument for flaw===
[[Poetic justice]] describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol, 125&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of ''hamartia'' as a vice to be punished&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol,12,125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Rymer. (2014). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514581/Thomas-Rymer&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phèdre'', Racine's adaptation of Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', is an example of French Neoclassical use of ''hamartia'' as a means of punishing vice.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, B. ''The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama'' 5th ed. 444-463. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Jean. ''Phèdre'', Harvard Classics, Vol. 26, Part 3. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/26/3/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Racine]] says in his Preface to ''Phèdre'', as translated by R.C. Knight:

{{quote|The failings of love are treated as real failings. The passions are offered to view only to show all the ravage they create. And vice is everywhere painted in such hues, that its hideous face may be recognized and loathed.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen,446&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The play is a tragic story about a [[royal family]]. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Euripedes. ''Hippolytus'', Harvard Classics, 8.7. Web. 8 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/8/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical argument for error===
In her 1963 ''[[Modern Language Review]]'' article, ''The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?'', Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of ''Poetics'' regarding ''hamartia'' as both error and "defect in character". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a "natural" expression to describe a flaw in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Samuel H., Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, New York 41911&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' of 1904 which she contends is misleading:

{{quote|...the comparatively innocent hero still shows some marked imperfection or defect, irresolution, precipitancy, pride, credulousness, excessive simplicity, excessive susceptibility to sexual emotion and the like...his weakness or defect is so intertwined with everything that is admirable in him...&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, A. C. 1851-1935. Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures On Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. London: Macmillan and co., limited, 1904. Web, 13 Dec. 2014. http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000240890;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Oedipus the King]]''. 

Hyde observes that students often state "thinking too much" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. 

In ''[[Oedipus the King]],'' she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation.   
 
In his 1978 ''[[Classical World (journal)|Classical World]]'' article ''Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus'', Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place ''hamartia's'' definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, [[Atë]], or divine intervention, plays in ''hamartia''.  The Butcher translation of "Poetics" references ''hamartia'' as both a "single great error", and "a single great defect in character", prompting critics to raise arguments. 

Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Leon. "Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus". ''The Classical World'', 72.1 (Sep., 1978), 3-12. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4348969&lt;/ref&gt; Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' ''hamartia'', "no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect."&lt;ref&gt;P. van Braam, "Aristotle's Use of Ἁμαρτία" ''The Classical Quarterly'', 6.4 (Oct., 1912), 266-272. London: Cambridge UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/635946&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. 

O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;Hey, O. "ἁμαρτία Zur Bedeutungsgeschichte des Wortes" ''Philologus'' 83 1-15, (1928). Web. 7 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of ''hamartia'' in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and [[Homer]]. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite ''hamartia'' as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, J.M. "Hamartia." Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy. Amsterdam, Adolf M. Hakkert, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical arguments on divine intervention===

J.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian ''hamartia''. Golden disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer observes that the Messenger in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' says, "He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by "dark powers" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. 

Dawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic ''[[dénouement]]'' can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. 

Golden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that ''hamartia'' principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from ''hamartia'', in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''head louse''' (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') is an [[obligate parasite|obligate]] [[parasitism|ectoparasite]] of [[human]]s that causes [[head lice infestation]] (pediculosis capitis).&lt;ref name="Buxton3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buxton|first = Patrick A.|title = The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition = 2nd|publisher = Edward Arnold|location = [[London]]|pages = 24–72|chapter = The biology of ''Pediculus humanus''|year = 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head lice are wingless [[insect]]s spending their entire lives on the human [[scalp]] and feeding exclusively on human [[blood]].&lt;ref name="Buxton3" /&gt; Humans are the only known [[host (biology)|hosts]] of this specific parasite, while [[chimpanzee]]s host a closely related species, ''Pediculus schaeffi''. Other species of [[lice]] infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds,&lt;ref name="Buxton3" /&gt; as well as other parts of the human body.

Lice differ from other [[hematophagic]] ectoparasites such as [[flea]]s in spending their entire lifecycle on a host.&lt;ref name="maunder"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Maunder | first=JW | title=The Appreciation of Lice | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain | volume=55 | pages=1–31 | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head lice cannot fly, and their short, stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;

The nondisease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying [[body louse]] (''Pediculus humanus humanus'') in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two [[subspecies]] are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M |title=Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |issue=16 |pages=1414–7 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12932325 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoneking"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024 |last=Stoneking |first=Mark |title=Erratum: Molecular Evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the Origin of Clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=24 |pages=2309 |date=29 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or [[crab louse]] (''Pthirus pubis''), also infests humans.

Head lice (especially in children) have been, and still are, subject to various eradication campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice are not the vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, and they have been regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a medical problem. Head lice infestations might be beneficial in helping to foster a natural [[immune]] response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous [[body louse]], which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases.&lt;ref name="mutualism"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rozsa| first = L |author2=Apari, P. | url =http://www.zoologia.hu/list/Why_infest.pdf | title =Why infest the loved ones – inherent human behaviour indicates former mutualism with head lice| journal =Parasitology | volume = 139 | issue = 6 | pages = 696–700| year =2012 | doi=10.1017/s0031182012000017 | pmid=22309598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult morphology==
[[File:Head louse crawling on hairbrush.webm|thumb|upright=1.4|Head louse crawling on hairbrush showing how tiny it is]]
Like other insects of the suborder [[Anoplura]], adult head lice are small (2.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm long), dorsoventrally flattened (see [[anatomical terms of location]]), and entirely wingless.&lt;ref name="buxton1"&gt;{{cite book|last= Buxton|first= Patrick A.|title= The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition=2nd|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|pages=1–4|chapter=The Anoplura or Sucking Lice|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thoracic]] segments are fused, but otherwise distinct from the [[head]] and [[abdomen]], the latter being composed of seven visible [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"&gt;{{cite book|last= Buxton|first= Patrick A.|title= The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition=2nd|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|pages=5–23|chapter=The Anatomy of ''Pediculus humanus''|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head lice are grey in general, but their precise color varies according to the environment in which they were raised.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Nuttall (1919) Parasitology 11:201–220 --&gt; After feeding, consumed blood causes the louse body to take on a reddish color.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;

===Head===
[[File:Fig. 1. Male of head louse.jpg|thumb|upright|Male head louse, adult]]
[[File:Pediculus humanus var capitis.jpg|thumb|horizontal|Female head louse, adult]]

One pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], each with five segments, protrudes from the insect's head. Head lice also have one pair of [[compound eye|eye]]s. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most other members of the Anoplura suborder.&lt;ref name="buxton1"/&gt; Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood.&lt;ref name="buxton1"/&gt; These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MerckVet"&gt;

===Thorax===
[[File:Head louse on human hair.jpg|thumb|upright|Head louse gripping a human hair]]
Six [[insect leg|legs]] project from the fused segments of the [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; As is typical in the Anoplura, these legs are short and terminate with a single [[claw]] and opposing "[[thumb]]".&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; Between its claw and thumb, the louse grasps the hair of its host.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; With their short legs and large claws, lice are well adapted to clinging to the hair of their host. These adaptations leave them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. Lice can climb up strands of hair very quickly, allowing them to move quickly and reach another host.&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;

===Abdomen===
Seven segments of the louse [[abdomen]] are visible.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; The first six segments each have a pair of [[spiracles]] through which the insect breathes.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; The last segment contains the [[anus]] and (separately) the [[genitalia]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;

===Sex differences===
In male lice, the front two legs are slightly larger than the other four. This specialized pair of legs is used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by a pointed end of the abdomen and a well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomens.

==Louse eggs==
[[File:Head louse egg 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Head louse egg (nit) attached to hair shaft of host]]

Like most insects, head lice are [[oviparous]]. Females lay about three or four eggs per day. Louse [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are attached near the base of a host hair shaft.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams LK, Reichert A, MacKenzie WR, Hightower AW, Blake PA |title=Lice, nits, and school policy |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1011–5 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11331679 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.5.1011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burkhart CN, Burkhart CG |title=Head lice: scientific assessment of the nit sheath with clinical ramifications and therapeutic options |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=129–33 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15965432 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg-laying behavior is temperature dependent and likely seeks to place the egg in a location that will be conducive to proper embyro development (which is, in turn, temperature dependent). In cool climates, eggs are generally laid within 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm of the scalp surface.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid {{convert|6|in|cm}} or more down the hair shaft.&lt;ref name="Meinking1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meinking | first = Terri Lynn | title = Infestations | journal = Current Problems in Dermatology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 75–118 |date=May–June 1999 | doi = 10.1016/S1040-0486(99)90005-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To attach an egg, the adult female secretes a glue from her reproductive organ. This glue quickly hardens into a "nit sheath" that covers the hair shaft and large parts of the egg except for the operculum, a cap through which the embryo breathes.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; The glue was previously thought to be [[chitin]]-based, but more recent studies have shown it to be made of [[protein]]s similar to hair [[keratin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt;

Each egg is oval-shaped and about 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; They are bright, transparent, and tan to coffee-colored so long as they contain an embryo, but appear white after hatching.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinking1999"/&gt; Head lice hatch typically six to nine days after [[oviposition]].&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Burgess, IF  | title = Human lice and their management | volume = 36 | pages = 271–342 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7484466 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60493-5 | series = Advances in Parasitology | isbn = 978-0-12-031736-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hatching, the louse [[nymph (biology)|nymph]] leaves behind its egg shell (usually known as a "nit", see below), still attached to the hair shaft. The empty egg shell remains in place until physically removed by abrasion or the host, or until it slowly disintegrates, which may take 6 or more months.&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"/&gt;

==Nits==
The term ''nit'' refers to an egg without embryo or a dead [[egg (biology)|egg]].&lt;ref name="nitdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nit |title=nit – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-02-25 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to eggs, this rather broad definition includes the following:&lt;ref name="pmid10959734"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A |title=Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America |journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=689–93; discussion 694 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10959734 |doi=10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, on the head of an infested individual, these eggs could be found:
* Viable eggs that will eventually hatch
* Remnants of already-hatched eggs (nits)
* Nonviable eggs (dead [[embryo]]) that will never hatch

This has produced some confusion in, for example, school policy (see [[Treatment of human head lice#School treatment|The "no-nit" policy]]) because, of the three items listed above, only eggs containing viable embryos have the potential to infest or reinfest a host.&lt;ref name="pmid14651472"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burgess, IF |title=Human lice and their control |journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. |volume=49 |issue= |pages=457–81 |year=2004 |pmid=14651472 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have reacted to this confusion by restricting the definition of nit to describe only a hatched or nonviable egg:

[[File:Anoplura hatching.jpg|thumb|Louse hatching]]

{{quote|In many languages, the terms used for the hatched eggs, which were obvious for all to see, have subsequently become applied to the embryonated eggs that are difficult to detect. Thus, the term "nit" in English is often used for both. However, in recent years, my colleagues and I have felt the need for some simple means of distinguishing between the two without laborious qualification. We have, therefore, come to reserve the term "nit" for the hatched and empty egg shell and refer to the developing embryonated egg as an "egg".|Ian F. Burgess (1995)&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"/&gt;}}

{{quote|The empty eggshell, termed a nit...|J. W. Maunder (1983)&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;}}

Others have retained the broad definition, while simultaneously attempting to clarify its relevance to infestation:

==Development and nymphs==
[[File:Pediculus humanus development.jpg|thumb|Development of ''Pediculus humanus humanus'' ([[body lice]]), which is similar to that of head lice (''Pediculus humanus capitis'')]]

Head lice, like other insects of the order [[Phthiraptera]], are [[hemimetabolous]].&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MerckVet"/&gt; Newly hatched [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] will [[Moulting|moult]] three times before reaching the sexually-mature adult stage.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Warburton, C. (1910) A preliminary investigation on flock as a possible distributor of vermin, and on the life history of the body-louse. Rep. Local Govt. Bourd, Pub. Health and Medical Subjects. (No. 27) --&gt; Thus, mobile head lice populations contain members of up to four developmental stages: three nymphal [[instars]], and the adult ([[imago]]).&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; [[Metamorphosis]] during head lice development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Buxton, P.A. (1938) Studies on growth of Pediculus (Anoplura). Parasitology 30:65–84 --&gt; Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior is similar to the adult. Nymphs feed only on human blood (hematophagia), and cannot survive long away from a host.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;

The time required for head lice to complete their nymph development to the imago depends on feeding conditions. At minimum, eight to nine days are required for lice having continuous access to a human host.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE? – Buxton may be citing Buxton, P.A. (1940) The biology of the body louse (Pediculus humanus corpis: Anoplura) under experimental conditions. Parasitology 32:303–312 --&gt; This experimental condition is most representative of head lice conditions in the wild. Experimental conditions where the nymph has more limited access to blood produces more prolonged development, ranging from 12 to 24 days.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE? – Buxton may be citing Buxton, P.A. (1940) The biology of the body louse (Pediculus humanus corpis: Anoplura) under experimental conditions. Parasitology 32:303–312 --&gt;

Nymph mortality in captivity is high—about 38%—especially within the first two days of life.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal and may be dependent on the humidity of the egg's environment.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host's blood throughout the insect. This results in death within a day or two.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Whether the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild is unclear.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;

==Reproduction and lifespan==
[[File:Nuttall 1917 f11.gif|right|thumb|Copulation in ''Pediculus humanus humanus'' (''Pediculus humanus capitis'' is similar), female is on top, with the male below. Dilation of the female's vagina has already occurred, and the male's dilator rests against his back (dorsal surface), out of the way. The male vesica, which contains the penis proper (not seen), is fully inserted into the vagina. Note the male's attachment with his specialized claws on the first leg pair to the specialized notch on the female's third leg pair.]]
Adult head lice [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and [[copulation]] is necessary for the female to produce fertile eggs. [[Parthenogenesis]], the production of viable offspring by virgin females, does not occur in ''Pediculus humanus''.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Buxton (1940) Parasitology 32:296–302 --&gt; Pairing can begin within the first 10 hours of adult life.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- Buxton cites Sikora (1915), but the article is in German --&gt; After 24 hours, adult lice copulate frequently, with [[mating]] occurring during any period of the night or day.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacot"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Bacot A |title=Contributions to the bionomics of ''Pediculus humanus (vestimenti)'' and ''Pediculus capitis'' |journal=Parasitology |volume=9 |pages=228–258 |year=1917 |doi=10.1017/S0031182000006065 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mating attachment frequently lasts more than an hour.&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt; Young males can successfully pair with older females, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Buxton (1940) Parasitology 32:303–312 --&gt;

Experiments with ''P. h. humanus'' (body lice) emphasize the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with six or more males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement.&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt; The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red—a condition attributed to rupture of the [[alimentary canal]] during the sexual act.&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt; Old females frequently die following, if not during, [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]].&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt;

A single louse has a 30-day lifecycle beginning from the moment the nit is laid until the adult louse dies.&lt;ref name="IJD"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mumcuoglu KY, Miller J, Gofin R, etal |title=Epidemiological studies on head lice infestation in Israel.

==Factors affecting infestation==
{{main|Head lice infestation}}

The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in head louse infestation. Girls are two to four times more frequently infested than boys. Children between 4 and 14 years of age are the most frequently infested group.&lt;ref name="IJD"/&gt;

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
All stages are blood-feeders and bite the skin four to five times daily to feed. They inject saliva which contains an [[anticoagulant]] and suck blood. The digested blood is excreted as dark red [[frass]].&lt;ref name="UF"&gt;{{cite web|last =Weems, Jr. |first =H. V. |author2=Fasulo, T.

===Position on host===
Although any part of the scalp may be colonized, lice favor the nape of the neck and the area behind the ears, where the eggs are usually laid. Head lice are repelled by light and move towards shadows or dark-coloured objects in their vicinity.&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall1919"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nuttall | first = George H.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
Lice have no wings or powerful legs for jumping, so they move using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair.&lt;ref name="UF"/&gt; Normally, head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, hats, brushes, towels, clothing, beds, or closets. [[Touching heads|Head-to-head contact]] is by far the most common route of lice transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liceliftersnewjersey.com/lice-myths-facts/ |title=NJ Head Lice &amp;#124; Philadelphia and South New Jersey Hair Lice |publisher=Lice Lifters New Jersey |accessdate=2012-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112031354/http://www.liceliftersnewjersey.com/lice-myths-facts/ |archivedate=2013-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial Symbiosis'''&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, D. R. and Laybourn, P. (2012), Redefining Industrial Symbiosis. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 16: 28–37. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00444.x&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of [[industrial ecology]]. It describes how a network of diverse organizations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change, create and share mutually profitable transactions - and improve business and technical processes.

Although geographic proximity is often associated with industrial symbiosis, it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange.  In practice, using industrial symbiosis as an approach to commercial operations – using, recovering and redirecting resources for reuse – results in resources remaining in productive use in the economy for longer. This in turn creates business opportunities, reduces demands on the earth’s [[natural resource|resources]], and provides a stepping-stone towards creating a [[circular economy]].  The industrial symbiosis model devised and managed by International Synergies Limited is a facilitated model operating at the national scale in the United Kingdom (NISP - National Industrial Symbiosis Programme), and at other scales around the world. International Synergies Limited has developed global expertise in IS, instigating programmes in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa and Turkey, as well as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;AM Hein, M Jankovic, R Farel, B Yannou 2015.

Proceedings of the ASME 2015 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial symbiosis is a subset of [[industrial ecology]], with a particular focus on material and energy exchange. Industrial ecology is a relatively new field that is based on a natural paradigm, claiming that an [[industrial ecology|industrial ecosystem]] may behave in a similar way to the natural [[ecosystem]] wherein everything gets recycled, albeit the simplicity and applicability of this paradigm has been questioned &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=S.H.|title=Comparing Products and Production in Ecological and Industrial Systems|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|date=2003|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=P.

==Introduction==
[[Eco-industrial development]] is one of the ways in which [[industrial ecology]] contributes to the integration of economic growth and [[environmental protection]]. Some of the examples of eco-industrial development are:

* [[Circular economy]] (single material and/or energy exchange)
* [[Greenfield land|Greenfield]] [[eco-industrial development]] (geographically confined space)
* [[Brownfield land|Brownfield]] [[eco-industrial development]] (geographically confined space)
* Eco-industrial network (no strict requirement of geographical proximity)
* Virtual eco-industrial network (networks spread in large areas e.g. regional network)
* Networked Eco-industrial System (macro level developments with links across regions)&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal A. &amp; Strachan P. 2006. Literature review on eco-industrial development initiatives around the world and the methods employed to evaluate their performance / effectiveness, Consultancy Report prepared for Databuild Ltd. and National Industrial Symbiosis Programme, 7 May 2006, Available from {{cite web |url=http://www.abhishekagarwal.co.uk/7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229213926/http://www.abhishekagarwal.co.uk/7.html |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''This classification omits any industrial sector-wide approaches and appreciates the diversity of the industrial system which is a key feature of industrial symbiosis. It is aimed to include initiatives that focus on achieving utility sharing and symbiosis among diverse sectors of industry''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature review on eco-industrial development initiatives around the world and the methods employed to evaluate their performance / effectiveness |url=http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/abs/National%20Industrial%20Symbiosis/Report%20for%20Databuild%20New.pdf |publisher=The Robert Gordon University |accessdate=24 April 2014 |author=Mr. Abhishek Agarwal and Dr. Peter Strachan |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040648/http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/abs/National%20Industrial%20Symbiosis/Report%20for%20Databuild%20New.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal A. &amp; Strachan P. 2006.

Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to [[competitive advantage]] involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are [[collaboration]] and the [[synergistic]] possibilities offered by geographic proximity".&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M. R. 2000.  Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 25: 313-337.
&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this definition and the stated key aspects of industrial symbiosis, i.e., the role of collaboration and geographic proximity, in its variety of forms, has been explored and empirically tested in the UK through the research and published activities of the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=P. D.|last2=et al.|title=Quantifying Geographic Proximity: Experiences from the United Kingdom's National Industrial Symbiosis Programme|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|date=2011|volume=55|issue=7|url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/29718/88/Quantifying_%27Geographic_Proximity%27_%28Jensen_et_al__2011%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombardi|first1=D.

Industrial symbiosis systems collectively optimize material and energy use at efficiencies beyond those achievable by any individual process alone. IS systems such as the web of materials and energy exchanges among companies in [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg, Denmark]] have spontaneously evolved from a series of micro innovations over a long time scale;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfeld, J. and Gertler, N. 1997. Industrial Ecology in Practice: The Evolution of Interdependence at [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]], Journal of Industrial Ecology 1(1): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the engineered design and implementation of such systems from a macro planner’s perspective, on a relatively short time scale, proves challenging. Nevertheless, there are examples of industrial symbiosis being approached as national / regional initiatives with some significant success particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Costa I., Massard G. and Agarwal A. 2010. Waste management policies for industrial symbiosis development: case studies in European countries, Journal of Cleaner Production 18: 815-822.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, access to information on available by-products is difficult to obtain. These by-products are considered [[waste]] and typically not traded or listed on any type of exchange.

==Example==
Recent work reviewed government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt [[photovoltaic]] factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a '''symbiotic industrial system''' are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of [[solar photovoltaic cells]]. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J.M. 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6891">[[File:Mechanism of Invagination .png|thumb|Mechanism of Invagination|300x300px]]
In [[developmental biology]], '''invagination''' is a mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. This mechanism or cell movement happens mostly in the [[vegetal pole]]. Invagination consists of the folding of an area of the exterior sheet of cells towards the inside of the [[blastula]]. In each organism, the complexity will be different depending on the number of cells. Invagination can be referenced as one of the steps of the establishment of the body plan.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Rauno |first2=Anne |date=1997 |title=Embryology, Constructing the Organism |format=book |language=english |location=Sunderland, MA. |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=0-87893-237-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Barresi |first2=Michael |date=2016 |title=Developmental Biology |format=book |language=English |location=Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=9781605354705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, originally used in [[embryology]], has been adopted in other disciplines as well. 
There is more than one type of movement for invagination. Two common types are axial and orthogonal. The difference between the production of the tube formed in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Axial can be formed at a single point along the axis of a surface. Orthogonal is linear and trough.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie A. Davies, In Mechanisms of Morphogensis (Second Edition), 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
* Invagination is the [[morphogenetic]] processes by which an [[embryo]] takes form, and is the initial step of [[gastrulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the massive reorganization of the embryo from a simple spherical ball of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], the [[blastula]], into a multi-layered [[organism]], with differentiated [[germ layer]]s: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.  More localized invaginations also occur later in embryonic development,
* The inner membrane of a [[mitochondrion]] '''invaginates''' to form [[crista]]e, thus providing a much greater surface area to accommodate the protein complexes and other participants that produce [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cronk|first=Jeff|title=Biochemistry Dictionary|url=http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114235521/http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|archivedate=2012-11-14|df=}}[dead link]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Invagination occurs during [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] when a vesicle forms within the cell and the membrane closes around it.
* Invagination of a part of the [[intestine]] into another part is called [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanco|first=Felix|title=Intussusception|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/930708-overview|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphioxus===
[[File:Invagination.jpg|thumb|Invagination process in Amphioxus]]
The invagination in ''Amphioxus'' is the first cell movement of [[gastrulation]]. This process was first described by Conklin. During [[gastrulation]], the [[blastula]] will be transformed by the invagination. The [[endoderm]] will fold towards the inner part and that way the [[blastocoel]] will be gone transforming into like a cup-shaped structure with a double wall. The inner wall will be called the [[archenteron]]; the primitive gut. The [[archenteron]] will open to the exterior through the [[blastopore]]. The outer wall will become the [[ectoderm]]. Later forming the [[epidermis]] and [[neural crest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browder |first=Leon |date=1984 |title=Developmental Biology |location=Canada |publisher=CBS College Publishing |page=599 |isbn= 4833702010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunicates===
In tunicates, invagination is the first mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. The four largest [[endoderm]] cells induce the invagination process in the [[tunicates]]. Invagination consists of the internal movements of a sheet of cells (the [[endoderm]]) based on changes in their shape. The [[blastula]] of the tunicates is a little flattened in the [[vegetal pole]] making a change of shape from a columnar to a wedge shape. Once the [[endoderm]] cells were invaginated, the cells will keep moving beneath the [[ectoderm]]. Later, the [[blastopore]] will be formed and with this, the invagination process is complete. The [[blastopore]] will be surrounded by the [[mesoderm]] by all sides.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"/&gt;

==Philosophy&lt;!-- 'Invagination (philosophy)' redirects here --&gt;==
In [[Continental philosophy]], the term '''invagination'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is used to explain a special kind of [[metanarrative]]. It was first used by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=The Visible and the Invisible|year=1968|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0810104571|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|invagination}}) to describe the dynamic self-differentiation of the 'flesh'. It was later used by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] ("The Law of Genre", ''Glyph 7'', 1980); for Derrida, an invaginated text is a narrative that folds upon itself, "endlessly swapping outside for inside and thereby producing a structure ''[[Mise en abyme|en abyme]]''".&lt;ref name=chaplin&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaplin|first=Susan|title=Law, Sensibility, and the Sublime in Eighteenth-Century Women's Fiction: Speaking of Dread|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOqNqq4i2ioC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754633068|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applies the term to such texts as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''&lt;ref name=chaplin/&gt; and [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s ''La Folie du Jour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5zCts8ax58C&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415267069|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invagination is an aspect of [[différance]], since according to Derrida it opens the "inside" to the "other" and denies both inside and outside a stable identity.&lt;ref name=wortham&gt;{{cite book|last=Wortham|first=Simon Morgan|title=The Derrida Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVtjXOyPSMAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=9781847065261|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libertatia''' (also known as '''Libertalia''') was a purported [[Anarchism|anarchist]] colony founded in the late 17th century in [[Madagascar]] by [[piracy|pirate]]s under the leadership of Captain James Misson (last name occasionally spelled "Mission", first name occasionally "Olivier"). 

Whether or not Libertalia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Captain Charles Johnson]], an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a [[pseudonym]] of [[Daniel Defoe]]. According to Johnson's description, Libertalia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known; however, most sources say it stretched from the [[Antongil Bay]] to [[Mananjary, Fianarantsoa]], including [[Île Sainte-Marie]] and [[Mahavelona]]. [[Thomas Tew]], Misson and a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] named Signor Caraccioli were involved in founding it.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

==Description==

Libertalia was a legendary free colony forged by [[pirate]]s and the pirate Captain Misson, although some historians have expressed doubts over its existence outside of literature. Historian and activist [[Marcus Rediker]] describes the pirates as follows:

{{quote|These pirates who settled in Libertalia would be "vigilant Guardians of the People's Rights and Liberties"; they would stand as "Barriers against the Rich and Powerful" of their day. By waging war on behalf of "the Oppressed" against the "Oppressors," they would see that "Justice was equally distributed."&lt;ref name="rediker"&gt;Rediker, Marcus (2004), ''Villains of All Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age'', Beacon Press, Beacon, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0-8070-5024-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the existence of Libertatia is contested, the radical ideas that it represented were very common in various pirate-era events. After the [[American Revolution]], pirates fleeing from [[England]] were wrecked on an island and set up their own Libertatia. They called their new island "the Republic of [[Spensonia]]", after a fictional Utopian country created by the English author and political reformer Thomas Spence. According to [[A. L. Morton]], it "looks backward to the medieval commune and forward to the withering away of the state."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. L. Morton|Morton, A. L.]] (1952), ''The English Utopia'', Lawrence &amp; Wishart. {{ISBN|0-85315-185-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pirates were against the various forms of authoritarian social constructs of their day, [[monarchy|monarchies]], [[slavery]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The pirates practiced forms of [[direct democracy]], where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and used systems of councils with delegates, who were supposed to think of themselves as "comerads" of the general population, and not rulers. The pirates [[Constructed language|created a new language]] for their colony and operated a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David (1996), ''Pirates: Terror on the High Seas from the Caribbean to the South China Sea'', 9th ed, World Publications. {{ISBN|1-57215-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] pirates were anti-capitalist, opposed to the dispossession that necessarily accompanied the historic ascent of [[wage labor]] and capitalism. They insisted that "every Man was born free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he respired."  They resented the "encroachments" by which "Villains" and "unmerciful Creditors" grew "immensely rich" as others became "wretchedly miserable."  They spoke of the "Natural right" to "a Share of the Earth as is necessary for our Support."  They saw piracy as a war of self-preservation.  [They redefined the] fundamental relations of property and power. They had no need for money "where every Thing was in common, and no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property," and they decreed that "the Treasure and Cattle they were Masters of should be equally divided."&lt;ref name="rediker"/&gt;}}

Misson's crews often were half white and black. The pirates have been reported to have freed enslaved people because the idea of slavery went against their own ideals of freedom.

The [[pirate utopia]]'s motto was "for God and liberty," and its flag was white,&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm |title=The Pirates' Who's Who |chapter=Misson, Captain |publisher=Burt Franklin |author=[[Edmund Gosse#Personal life|Philip Gosse]] |year=1924 |pages=211–219 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;!--This source is a complete public domain account of the history of Libertatia and biography of Captain Misson--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a [[Jolly Roger]]. They were [[Anarchism|anarchists]], waging war against states and lawmakers, attacking their ships, sparing prisoners, and freeing slaves. They called themselves ''Liberi'', and lived under a communal city rule, a sort of worker owned corporation of piracy. They had [[pirate code|articles]] (shared codes of conduct), and used elected systems of re-callable delegates.

Misson was French, born in Provence, and it was while he was in Rome on leave from the French warship Victoire that he lost his faith, disgusted by the decadence of the Papal Court. In Rome he ran into Caraccioli - a "lewd Priest" who over the course of long voyages with little to do but talk, gradually converted Misson and a sizeable portion of the rest of the crew to his way of thinking:

{{quote|he fell upon Government, and shew'd, that every Man was born free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he respired... that the vast Difference betwixt Man and Man, the one wallowing in Luxury, and the other in the most pinching Necessity, was owing only to Avarice and Ambition on the one Hand, and a pusillanimous Subjection on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Defoe|title=A General History of the Pyrates|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=389|ISBN=978-0486404882}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Embarking on a career of piracy, the 200 strong crew of the Victoire called upon Misson to be their captain. They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding "all should be in common."&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt; All decisions were to be put to "the Vote of the whole Company." Thus they set out on their new "Life of Liberty." Off the west coast of Africa they captured a Dutch [[slave ship]]. The slaves were freed and brought aboard the Victoire, Misson declaring that "the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power of Liberty of another" and that "he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others." At every engagement they added to their numbers with new French, English and Dutch recruits, and freed African slaves.

While cruising round the coast of Madagascar, Misson found a perfect bay in an area with fertile soil, fresh water and friendly natives. Here the pirates built Libertalia, renouncing their titles of English, French, Dutch or African and calling themselves Liberi. They created their own language, a polyglot mixture of African languages, combined with French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and native [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. Shortly after the beginning of building work on the colony of Libertalia, the Victoire ran into the pirate Thomas Tew, who decided to accompany them back to Libertalia. Such a colony was no new idea to Tew; he had lost his quartermaster and 23 of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Liberi - "Enemies to Slavery," aimed to boost their numbers by capturing another slave ship. Off the coast of Angola, Tew's crew took an English slave ship with 240 men, women and children below decks. The African members of the pirate crew discovered many friends and relatives among the enslaved and struck off their fetters and handcuffs, regaling them with the glories of their new life of liberty.

The pirates settled down to become farmers, holding the land in common - "no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property." Prizes and money taken at sea were "carry'd into the common Treasury, Money being of no Use where every Thing was in common."

The consensus of modern scholarship is that Libertalia (or Libertatia) was not a real place.&lt;ref name="Little-The Golden Age of Piracy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Little|first1=Benerson|title=The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781510713048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2uIDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kevin Rushby toured the area seeking descendants of pirate inhabitants but declined to search the jungles for Libertalia, noting “others have tried and failed many times.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushby|first1=Kevin|title=Hunting Pirate Heaven: In Search of Lost Pirate Utopias|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York|isbn=9780802779779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxCiAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were pirate settlements on and around Madagascar, on which Libertalia may have been based: [[Abraham Samuel]] at [[Fort Dauphin (Madagascar)|Port Dauphin]], [[Adam Baldridge]] at [[Ile Ste.-Marie]], and [[James Plaintain]] at [[Rantabe|Ranter Bay]] were all ex-pirates who founded trading posts and towns.

A '''love-in''' is a peaceful public gathering focused on [[meditation]], [[love]], [[music]], [[human sexual behavior|sex]] and/or use of [[psychedelic drug]]s.  The term was coined by Los Angeles radio comedian [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], who also hosted the first one in March or April 1967 (sources disagree) in [[Elysian Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangelesfreepress.com/the-impossible-come-back-of-radio-free-oz/]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The impossible come-back of Radio Free Oz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firesigntheatre.com/albums/bergman.html] Peter Bergman biography&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been interpreted in different ways by different organizations, but is often connected to [[civil disobedience|protest]]ing local, social or [[Environmental movement|environmental]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;

The soil salinity on the ''x''-axis is represented by electric conductivity (ECe). In this example the crop has a salt tolerance (threshold) of ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Pb&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;dS/m beyond which the yield diminishes.]]

The '''Maas–Hoffman model''' is a mathematical tool to characterize the relation between [[crop production]] and [[soil salinity]]. It describes the crop response by a broken line of which the first part is horizontal and the second is sloping downward.&lt;ref&gt;Maas EV, Hoffman GJ, 1977. ''Crop salt tolerance-current assessment''. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers 103: 115-134.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''breakpoint'' (Pb) or ''threshold'' is also called ''tolerance'' because up to that point the yield is unaffected by the salinity, so the salt is tolerated, while at greater salinity values the crops are affected negatively and the yield goes down.

==Mathematics==

Mathematically the two lines are represented by the equations:

: ''Y'' = ''C'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''X''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]
: ''Y'' = ''AX'' + ''B'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  [''X''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]

where ''Y''&amp;nbsp;= crop production or yield, ''C''&amp;nbsp;= maximum yield, ''X''&amp;nbsp;= soil salinity, ''A''&amp;nbsp;= slope (regression coefficient) of the descending line, and ''B''&amp;nbsp;= regression constant of that line.

In the example of the figure: ''C'' = 1.2, ''A'' = —0.10, Pb = 7.0

The value of Pb is to be found by [[regression analysis]] and [[optimization]] so that the [[goodness of fit]] of the data to the model is maximum.

The Maas–Hoffman model is used in [[Crop tolerance to seawater#Modeling|crop tolerance to seawater]].
[[File:Maas-Hoffman model inverted.png|thumb|350px|Inverted Maas-Hoffman model for the relation between crop yield and depth of the watertable]]

==Inverted model==

For growth factors, like the depth of the [[watertable]], that affect crop production negatively at low values while there is no effect at high values, the inverted Maas–Hoffman model can be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5171">In cognitive psychology, the '''missing letter effect''' refers to the finding that, when people are asked to [[consciously]] detect target letters while reading text, they miss more letters in frequent, function words (e.g. the letter "h" in "the") than in less frequent, content words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The effect is usually measured using a paper-and-pencil procedure, where readers are asked to circle a target letter every time they come across it while reading a short passage.  The missing letter effect is more likely to appear when reading words that are part of a normal sequence, than when words are embedded in a mixed-up sequence (e.g. readers asked to read backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A new model called the guidance-organization model was recently proposed to potentially explain the missing letter effect. It is a combination of the two models proposed by Healy, Koriat, and Greenberg.  As Greenberg et al. explain: "The time spent processing high-frequency function words at the whole-word level is relatively short, thereby enabling the fast and early use of these words to build a tentative structural frame."&lt;ref&gt;

They suggest that attention disengages faster from functional words than content words leading to the missing letter effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">In [[metaphysics]], '''particulars''' are defined as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers. There are, however, theories of ''[[abstract particulars]]'' or ''[[Trope theory|tropes]]''. For example, [[Socrates]] is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars). Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (for example a bicycle, an apple, and a given woman's hair can all be red).

==Overview==
[[Sybil Wolfram]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sybil Wolfram]], ''Philosophical Logic'', Routledge, London and New York, 1989, {{ISBN|0-415-02317-3}}, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; writes &lt;blockquote&gt;
Particulars include only individuals of a certain kind: as a first approximation individuals with a definite place in space and time, such as persons and material objects or events, or which must be identified through such individuals, like smiles or thoughts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some terms are used by philosophers with a rough-and-ready idea of their meaning. This can occur if there is lack of agreement about the best definition of the term. In formulating a solution to the [[problem of universals]], the term 'particular' can be used to describe the ''particular'' instance of redness of a certain apple as opposed to the 'universal' 'redness' (being [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]).

The term particular is also used as a modern equivalent of the Aristotelian notion of individual substance. Used in this sense, particular can mean any concrete (individual) entity, irrespective of whether it is spatial and temporal or not.

The series is filmed in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], where it chronicles the daily activities at the World Famous Gold &amp; Silver [[Pawnbroker|Pawn Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison and Tim Keown.

The series depicts the staff's interactions with customers, who bring in a variety of [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s to sell or pawn, and who are shown haggling over the price and discussing its historical background, with narration provided by either the Harrisons or Chumlee.

The series also follows the [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal conflicts]] among the cast. One reviewer referencing these conflicts described the show as a version of ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' "hijacked by ''[[American Chopper]]''{{'}}s Teutul family".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/living/51132932.html Lawrence, Christopher. "Las Vegas pawnshop center of new reality series"] ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''; July 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' has offered a similar description, calling the show "one part ''Antiques Roadshow'', a pinch of ''[[LA Ink]]'' and a dash of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]''".&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Moynihan, Rob. "Summer's Guilty Pleasures". ''[[TV Guide]]''. June 21, 2010. Page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous local experts in a variety of fields also regularly appear to appraise the items being sold or pawned, two of whom have gone on to their own [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] programs.

== Production history and format==
''Pawn Stars'' began with [[Brent Montgomery]] and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures, who were struck by the array of eclectic and somewhat seedy pawn shops in Las Vegas during a 2008 weekend visit to the city. Thinking such shops might contain unique characters, they searched for a family-run shop on which to center a TV series, until they found the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop less than two miles from the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;Fixmer, Andy (October 21, 2010).

''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the manager and part-owner, Rick Harrison, had been trying unsuccessfully to pitch a show based on his shop for four years.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=VegasNews&gt;[http://www.vegasnews.com/41913/pawn-stars-richard-old-man-harrison-celebrates-70th-birthday.html "Pawn Stars’ Richard "Old Man" Harrison Celebrates 70th Birthday"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EW&gt;Smith, Grady (June 28, 2010).

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The shop, and Rick, had previously been featured in the Las Vegas episode of ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Gvu6APT3JLY|"Pawn Stars circa 2003"}}, accessed Sep 19, 2009, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was originally pitched to [[HBO]], though the network preferred the series to have been a ''[[Taxicab Confessions]]''-style series taking place at the Gold &amp; Silver's night window.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; Keown, 2011. page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-02-19-trashtv19_CV_N.htm|title=From 'Pawn Stars' to 'Pickers,' America's trash is TV's treasure|last=Strauss|first=Gary|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] president [[Nancy Dubuc]], who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, which was initially titled ''Pawning History'', before a staffer at Leftfield suggested that ''Pawn Stars'' would fit better with the locale.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; Keown, 2011. page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt;

[[File:Pawn Stars shop by Mike Salvucci.jpg|thumb|right|World Famous Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in 2010]]
The series is filmed on location at the World Famous Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although jewellery is the most commonly pawned item at the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pezzed Off|series=Pawn Stars|season=2|number=15|network=History|date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the customers featured in episodes bring in a variety of vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Face the Music|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|date=July 25, 2011|season=4|number=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Wright Stuff|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|airdate=August 15, 2011|season=4|number=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which one of the staff members, usually Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the "Old Man"), explains the history behind the object. When the buyer is unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value, and in the case of items needing repair, the cost of restoration or preparing the item for sale. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over the potential value with the customer, including the expert's opinion, if one is given, often interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price. On occasion, Rick will purchase items in need of restoration before determining its restoration costs, thus taking a risk on such costs.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include the [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] in "Sharks and Cobra" and the barber's chair in "A Shot and a Shave".&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal narratives focusing on the relationship and conflicts among Rick, Corey, the Old Man, and Corey's childhood friend, Austin "Chumlee" Russell, who also works at the shop, also comprise episode plots. These usually pertain to arguments over the running of the shop, the elder Harrisons questioning Corey's judgment,&lt;ref name=CoreySales/&gt;&lt;ref name=CoreyExpensive/&gt; and aspersions cast on Chumlee's intelligence and competence.&lt;ref name=ChumSmart/&gt; Before the second commercial break, a multiple choice trivia question related to the shop and its inventory, the cast members or one of the featured items is shown, with the answer provided after the break; beginning with the Season 8 episode "A Very Vegas Christmas", a trivia question is asked at every commercial break.

In addition to spawning imitators, such as the [[truTV]] series ''[[Hardcore Pawn]]'', the success of ''Pawn Stars'' has been a boon to the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop, which has become a Las Vegas tourist site,&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; and has expanded its business accordingly. Originally averaging between 70 and 100 customers per day, the shop's traffic increased to more than 1,000 by October 2010. To handle the increased business, the shop hired nearly 30 new employees,&lt;ref&gt;Corey Harrison indicates he manages 30 employees in the second season episode "Backroom Brawl", and later states the shop has 48 employees in the third season episode "Like a Rolling Chum". The [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/28/pawn-stars-rick-harrison-interview/ June 2010 ''Entertainment Weekly'' source] also indicates a staff of over 40 employees. According to Richard Harrison on Page 88 of his son's 2011 autobiography, ''License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold &amp; Silver'', the shop had 12 employees at the time the show began production.&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent a $400,000 expansion of their showroom by two thirds, to 15,000 square feet,&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; the shop's tenth expansion since it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Peacemaker|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|season=4|number=27|airdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Harrison also mentioned in the fourth season episode "Over the Top" that he was building a gym above the Pawn Shop for the staff's use.&lt;ref name=OverTheTop/&gt; The shop also now sells its own brand merchandise, whose designs originate from fans entering design competitions on [[Facebook]], which saves the Harrisons the cost of hiring professional designers. The staff's presence on Facebook and [[Twitter]] also ensures audiences during local nightclub appearances, for which Corey Harrison and Chumlee Russell are paid $1,000 a night.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt; As a result of filming at the shop, however, the four main cast members no longer work the counter, due to laws that require the identity of customers pawning items to remain confidential, and the tourists and fans taking photos and video in the showroom that would preclude this. When shooting episodes of the series, the shop is temporarily closed, with only a handful of customers allowed into the showroom.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 2011. pp. 70, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Harrison signed a record-breaking 80-episode renewal contract for four more seasons of the series.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt;

After being broadcast during its first four years on Mondays at 10PM ET, the program moved to Thursday nights at 9PM ET on May 30, 2013,&lt;ref name=EW042213&gt;Hibberd, James (April 22, 2013).

January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was the second highest-rated reality series on TV behind '' [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', attracting 7.6 million viewers.&lt;ref name=9.19.11TVG&gt;Schneider, Michael. "Summer TV Winners and Losers". ''TV Guide''. September 19, 2011. Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a ''[[New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that ''Pawn Stars'' was most popular in rural Kentucky.&lt;ref name="katz20161227"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title=‘Duck Dynasty’ vs. ‘Modern Family’: 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=2016-12-27 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Christopher Long, reviewing the first season DVD for DVD Town, praised the series for its cast and the educational value of the items examined, calling it "addictive" and "a big-time winner", and opined that it is the best show on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] and perhaps cable.&lt;ref name=MovieMetropolis/&gt; In one issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', writer Rob Moynihan included the show in a list of "guilty pleasures."&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; April McIntyre of Monsters and Critics, whose negative view of pawn shops influenced her view of the series' setting, reviewed one episode of the series, which she labeled a "cool ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''". Though she found aspects of it interesting, she criticized what she perceived as an emphasis on cheap laughs at the expense of family [[patriarch]] Richard Harrison over the show's historical material, as well as Corey Harrison's weight. She ultimately saw potential for the series if aspects of it that she found to be in poor taste were curbed.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1490653.php/History_s_Pawn_Star_some_thoughts |title=April MacIntyre "History's Pawn Star$, some thoughts" Monsters and Critics; July 20, 2009 |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310172332/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1490653.php/History_s_Pawn_Star_some_thoughts |archivedate=March 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'''s Gary Strauss opined that the bickering among the Harrisons, as well as the customers seen in the shop, is "alternately amusing and grating".

The series has also attracted some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, claim that the series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order to pay their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100131/LIFESTYLE/1310324 |title=Local pawn shops see more DVDs than diamonds |last=Nelson |first=Emily |date=January 31, 2010 |work=The News-Star |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205084332/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100131/LIFESTYLE/1310324 |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the series has also lent itself to parody. At the June 2011 [[List of National Hockey League awards|NHL Awards]] in Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=557821 "Stars return to Vegas for the 2011 NHL Awards"].

On July 17, 2012, the [[Clark County Commission]] declared that day to be "Pawn Stars/Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Day". At the Commission meeting, Richard "The Old Man" Harrison donated $1,000 to the [[Clark County Heritage Museum]], and lent the U.S. Senate floor chair used by Senator [[Patrick McCarran]] (sold to the Gold and Silver in the ''Pawn Stars'' episode "Take a Seat") to the museum as part of a display on Senator McCarran.&lt;ref&gt;Toplikar, Dave (July 17, 2012).

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Pazend [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpə'zend/]]''' or '''Pazand''' Middle Persian: 𐭯𐭠𐭰𐭭𐭣 Avestan: ''𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬙𐬌‎'' is one of the [[writing system]]s used for the [[Middle Persian]] language. It was based on the [[Avestan alphabet]], a phonetic alphabet originally used to write [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the language of the [[Avesta]], the primary sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].

Pazend's principal use was for writing the commentaries (''Zend'') on and/or translations of the Avesta. The word "Pazend" ultimately derives from the Avestan words ''paiti zainti'', &lt;!-- Dhalla. ''Zend'' is middle Persian for ''âzainti'' in Avestan --&gt;which can be translated as either "for commentary purposes" or "according to understanding" (phonetically).

Pazend had the following characteristics, both of which are to be contrasted with [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]], which is one of the other systems used to write Middle Persian:
*Pazend was a variant of the [[Avestan alphabet]] (''Din dabireh''), which was a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet. In contrast, Pahlavi script was only an [[abjad]]. 
*Pazend did not have [[ideograms]]. In contrast, ideograms were an identifying feature of the Pahlavi system, and these ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig|huzvarishn]]'' were words borrowed from [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Aramaic]] that continued to be spelled as in Aramaic (in Pahlavi script) but were pronounced as the corresponding word in Persian.

[[Image:Avestan-LE.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A Pazend title (for a published [[Avesta]]) that reads ''pargart auual'' (as transliterated in the Hoffmann system) and demonstrates the use of the ''el'' grapheme (leftmost symbol here, resembling a Latin 'p'). This letter was added to the alphabet specifically for use in Pazend script; it is not needed for writing the [[Avestan language]].]]

In combination with its religious purpose, these features constituted a "sanctification" of written Middle Persian. The use of the Avestan alphabet to write Middle Persian required the addition of one symbol to the Avestan alphabet: This character, to support Middle Persian's {{IPA|/l/}}, phoneme had not previously been needed.

Following the fall of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]], after which Zoroastrianism came to be gradually supplanted by [[Islam]], Pazend lost its purpose and soon ceased to be used for original composition. In the late 11th or early 12th century, Indian Zoroastrians (the [[Parsi]]s) began translating Avestan or Middle Persian texts into Sanskrit and Gujarati. Some Middle Persian texts were also ''transcribed'' into the Avestan alphabet. The latter process, being a form of interpretation, was known as 'pa-zand'. "Pazand texts, transcribed phonetically, represent a late and often corrupt Middle Persian pronunciation, and so present their own problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Sanskrit, Old Gujarati and Pazand writings|title=Textual sources for the study of Zoroastrianism|year=1984|publisher=Manchester UP|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The corruptions during this process are sometimes considerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Middle Persian literature: The later religious writings|p=47&lt;!--32-66--&gt;|title=Iranistik II: Literatur|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik, vol 4|year=1968|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the transcribed texts are the prefaces (''dibacheh'') to prayers in Avestan. These prefatory prayers are invariably written in Pazend because of the need for "accurate" pronunciation. This practice has led to the misconception that "Pazend" is the name of a language.

Following [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]]'s translation of some of the texts of the Avesta in the late 18th century, the term "Zend-Avesta" was mistakenly used to refer to the sacred texts themselves (as opposed to commentaries on them). This usage subsequently led to the equally mistaken use of "Pazend" for the Avestan script as such and  "Zend" for the Avestan language.&lt;!-- cf Ethnologue report for Avestan (SIL: avs)--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10850">'''Peaceful coexistence''' ({{lang-ru|Мирное сосуществование|translit=Mirnoye sosushchestvovaniye}}) was a theory developed and applied by the [[Soviet Union]] at various points during the [[Cold War]] in the context of primarily [[Marxist–Leninist]] foreign policy and was adopted by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied [[socialist state]]s that they could peacefully coexist with the [[capitalism|capitalist]] bloc (i.e., U.S.-allied states). This was in contrast to the [[antagonistic contradiction]] principle that [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] could never coexist in peace. The [[Soviet Union]] applied it to relations between the western world, particularly between the [[United States]] and [[NATO]] countries and the nations of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

Debates over differing interpretations of peaceful coexistence were one aspect of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the [[People's Republic of China]] under the leadership of its founder, [[Mao Zedong]], argued that a belligerent attitude should be maintained towards capitalist countries, and so initially rejected the peaceful coexistence theory as essentially [[Marxist revisionism]].

However, their decision in 1972 to establish a trade relationship with the United States also saw China cautiously adopting a version of the theory to relations between itself and non-socialist countries. From that point through to the early 1980s and [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]], China increasingly extended its own peaceful coexistence concept to include all nations. [[Enver Hoxha]] also denounced this and turned against China as a result of China growing closer ties to the West such as [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] and today [[Hoxhaist]] parties continue to denounce the concept of peaceful coexistence.

Peaceful coexistence, in extending itself to all countries and social movements tied to the [[USSR]]'s interpretation of communism, quickly became [[modus operandi]] for many individual [[communist parties]] as well, encouraging quite a few, especially those in the [[developed world]], to give up their long-term goal of amassing support for an armed, insurrectionist [[communist revolution]] and exchange it for more full participation in [[elections|electoral politics]].

==Soviet policy==

[[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] solidified the concept in Soviet foreign policy in 1956 at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  The policy arose as a temptation to reduce hostility between the two superpowers, particularly in light of the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The Soviet theory of peaceful coexistence asserted that the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and their respective political ideologies, could coexist rather than fighting one another, and Khrushchev tried to demonstrate his commitment to peaceful coexistence by attending international peace conferences, such as the [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Summit]], and by traveling internationally, such as his trip to America's [[Camp David]] in 1959. The [[World Peace Council]] founded in 1949 and largely funded by the [[Soviet Union]] attempted to organize a [[peace movement]] in favor of the concept internationally.

Peaceful coexistence was meant to assuage Western, capitalist concerns that the socialist Soviet Union was driven by the concept of [[world revolution]] advocated by its founders, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolshevik]]s. Lenin and the Bolsheviks advocated world revolution through workers' "internal revolutions" within their own nations, but they had never advocated its spread by intra-national warfare, such as invasion by [[Red Army]] troops from a neighboring socialist nation into a capitalist one.

Indeed, short of such "internal revolutions" by workers themselves, Lenin had talked about "peaceful cohabitation" with capitalist countries. Khrushchev used this aspect of Lenin's politics to argue that while socialism would eventually triumph over [[capitalism]], this would be done not by force but by example. Implicitly, this proclamation meant the end of the USSR's advocacy of the spread of communist revolution through insurrectionist violence, which some communists around the world saw as a betrayal of the principles of revolutionary communism itself.

In addition to being a reaction to the realization that a nuclear war between the two superpowers would ensure the destruction of not only the [[socialist]] system but the entirety of humanity, it also reflected the USSR's strategic military disposition - the move away from large, and possibly politically offensive, military ventures towards a force centered on [[proxy war]]s and a strategic nuclear missile force. Although disquiet over this shift helped bring Khrushchev down, his successors did not return to the [[antagonistic contradiction]] theories of an inevitable conflict between the [[capitalist]] and socialist systems. Initially, this was [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s main gripe with the theory, and the reason the latter from then on classified the Soviet Union as a "betrayer of the Revolution."

===Cuban Policy===
{{quote|As Marxists we have maintained that peaceful coexistence among nations does not encompass coexistence between the exploiters and the exploited, between the oppressors and the oppressed.|[[Che Guevara]], December 11, 1964 speech to the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/12/11.htm "Colonialism is Doomed"] speech to the 19th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City by Cuban representative [[Che Guevara]] on December 11, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the most outspoken critics of peaceful coexistence during the early 1960s was Argentine [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]]. As a leader in the Cuban government during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|October Missile Crisis]], Guevara believed that a repeat invasion by the United States (after the [[Bay of Pigs invasion|Bay of Pigs]]) would be justifiable grounds for  a nuclear war. In Guevara's view, the capitalist bloc was composed of "hyenas and jackals" that "fed on unarmed peoples".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

==Chinese policy==

[[Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] proposed the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] in 1954 during negotiations with [[India]] over [[Tibet]] and these were written into the ''Agreement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India'' signed in 1954 by Zhou and [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The principles were reiterated by Zhou at the [[Bandung Conference]] of [[Asia]]n and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries where they were incorporated into the conference declarations.  One major consequence of this policy was that the PRC would not support Communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia, particularly in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], and would distance itself from [[overseas Chinese]] in those nations.

However, [[Maoist]] doctrine continued to emphasise the survivability of any conflict between the ''imperialist'' and ''socialist'' ''world systems'' - the Chinese continued to advocated a stronger form of the [[campist]] theory of [[global politics]] than that approved in the USSR.

With Mao's death the Chinese softened their line, though would never endorse the views of their rivals. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the concept of peaceful coexistence was expanded as a framework for all sovereign nations.  In 1982 the Five Principles were written into the [[Constitution]] of the People's Republic of China which claims to be bound by them in its international relations.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as promoted by China are:
*mutual respect for [[sovereignty]] and territorial integrity
*mutual non-aggression
*non-interference in each other's internal affairs
*equality and mutual benefit
*peaceful co-existence

There are three notable consequences of the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence. First of all, in contrast with the Soviet concepts of the mid-1970s, the Chinese concepts include the encouragement of global [[free trade]]. Second, the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence places a large emphasis on national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus moves by the United States to promote democracy and human rights are seen in this framework as hostile. Finally, as the PRC does not consider [[Taiwan]] to be sovereign, the concept of peaceful coexistence does not extend to Taiwan, and efforts by other nations, particularly the United States, to involve itself in PRC-Taiwan relations are seen as hostile actions in this framework.

==Use in modern diplomacy==

More recently, the phrase has gained currency beyond its usage in communist phraseology and has been adopted by the broader diplomatic world. For instance, in his 2004 Christmas address, [[Pope John Paul II]] called for "peaceful coexistence" in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4124961.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Pope delivers sombre message|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Photobacterium damselae'' subsp. ''piscicida''''' (previously known as '''''Pasteurella piscicida''''') is a [[gram-negative]] rod-shaped [[bacterium]] that causes disease in [[fish]].

==Disease==
Pasteurellosis is also described as photobacteriosis (due to the change in the taxonomic position), is caused by the [[halophilic]] bacterium ''Photobacterium damselae'' subsp. ''piscicida'' (formerly ''Pasteurella piscicida'').
It was first isolated in mortalities occurring in natural populations of [[white perch]] (''Morone americanus'') and [[striped bass]] (''M. saxatilis'') in 1963 in [[Chesapeake Bay]], USA (''Snieszko ''et al.'', 1964''). Since 1969, this disease has been one of the most important in Japan, affecting mainly [[yellowtail (fish)|yellowtail]] (''Seriola quinqueradiata'') (Kusuda &amp; Yamaoka, 1972). From 1990 it has caused economic losses in different European countries including France (Baudin-Laurencin ''et al.'', 1991), Italy (Ceschia ''et al.'', 1991), Spain (Toranzo ''et al.'', 1991), Greece (Bakopoulos ''et al.'', 1995), Turkey (Canand ''et al.'', 1996), Portugal (Baptista ''et al.'', 1996) and Malta (Bakopoulos ''et al.'', 1997). Gilthead sea bream (''Sparus aurata''), seabass (''Dicentrarchus labrax'') and sole (''Solea'' spp.) are the most affected species in Europe Mediterranean countries, as well as hybrid striped bass (''M. saxatilis'' x ''M. chrysops'') in the USA. However, the natural hosts of the pathogen are a wide variety of marine fish (Romalde &amp; Magariños, 1997).

This pathology is temperature dependent and occurs usually when water temperatures rise above 18-20&amp;nbsp;°C. Below this temperature, fish can harbour the pathogen as subclinical infection and become carriers for long time periods (Romalde, 2002).

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Phdp.jpeg]] --&gt;

==Symptoms==
Pastereullosis is also known as pseudotubercullosis because it is characterized by the presence, in the chronic form of the disease, of creamy-white granulomatous nodules or whitish tubercules in several internal organs, composed of masses of bacterial cells, [[epithelial]] cells, and [[fibroblast]]s. The nodules are most prominent in internal viscera, particularly kidney and spleen, and the infection is accompanied by widespread internal necrosis (Evelyn, 1996; Romalde, 2002; Barnes ''et al.'', 2005). Anorexia with darkening of the skin as well as focused necrosis of the gills are the only external clinical signs often observed. These lesions are generally missing in the acute form. The disease is difficult to eradicate with [[antibiotics|antibiotic treatments]], and there is evidence that carriers under stressful conditions could suffer from reinfection (Le Breton, 1999).

==Identification==
Morphologically, the bacteria is a rod shaped cell, with no [[motility]].
Gram negative, with bipolar staining.
The presumptive identification of the pathogen is based on standard biochemical tests. In addition, although ''Ph. damselae'' subsp. ''piscicida'' is not included in the API-20E code index, this miniaturised system can also be useful for its identification, since all strains display the same profile (2005004). Slide agglutination test using specific antiserum is needed for a confirmative identification of the microorganism (Romalde, 2002).

[[Image:API Phdp.jpeg]]

==Virulence==
The virulence of the pathogen implies the production of polysaccharide capsular layer, and extracellular products, and is also depending on iron availability (Lopez-Doriga ''et al.'', 2000). The bacteria spreads via infected phagocytes, mainly macrophages. This spread can be rapid, and lethal effects may occur within a few days of challenge, affecting tissues containing large numbers of the pathogens (Evelyn, 1996).

There are several definitions for '''professional abuse''' and distinctions are usually pronounced in definitions according to professional fields. One of the general descriptions, however, that sought to bridge the variations was put forward by the National Council of Psychotherapists, which explained professional abuse as a violation of an organization's [[Ethical code|code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk/Newsletter/Ed001/Professional_Abuse.html|title=Professional Abuse|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=|website=natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to this as standards of behavior, which include the maintenance of [[professional boundaries]] and the treatment of people with respect and dignity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/abuse/abuse-by-health-and-social-care-workers/#.W2mcjNIzbDd|title=Abuse by health and social care workers {{!}} Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive version of this description states that this type of abuse is "a pattern of conduct in which a person abuses, violates, or takes advantage of a victim within the context of the abuser's profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-professional-abuse.htm|title=What Is Professional Abuse?|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional abusers are the individuals who prey on the weaknesses of others in their workplaces or in other places related to economical strands of society. Their fundamental behavior is based in the following actions:

* taking advantage of their client or patient's [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]
* exploiting their [[vulnerability]]
* not acting in their best interests
* failing to keep [[professional boundaries]]

== Forms of abuse ==
There are many forms of abuse. It may be:
* [[discriminatory]]
* [[Abuse#Financial abuse|financial]]
* [[physical abuse|physical]]
* [[psychological abuse|psychological]]
* [[sexual abuse|sexual]]

Professional abuse always involves:
* [[betrayal]]
* [[wikt:exploit|exploitation]]
* violation of professional boundaries

Professionals can abuse in three ways:
* [[nonfeasance]] - ignore and take no indicated action - neglect.
* [[misfeasance]] - take inappropriate action or give intentionally incorrect advice.
* [[malfeasance]] - hostile, aggressive action taken to injure the client's interests.

== Solutions ==
There are several strategies available to organizations seeking to address professional abuse. A study, for instance, revealed that this problem often arises when there is an extreme power imbalance between the professional and the victim. A framework based on different grades of client empowerment and ways of strengthening it can help solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=2000|title=Client empowerment in psychiatry and the professional abuse of clients: where do we stand?|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine|volume=30|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.2190/AC9N-YTLE-B639-M3P4|issn=0091-2174|pmid=10900561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have been subjected to professional abuse could also pursue any of the following courses of actions: lodging a complaint; reporting abuse to the police; and, taking legal action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also organizations that can help those who are victimized learn more about their rights and the options available to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4485">{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
'''Rav akçesi''' was a "[[rabbi]] tax" paid by [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish communities]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turcica: revue d'études turques, Volumes 24-25|year=1992|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;dq=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENqtTc77LZCp8APbtrSVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in [[Istanbul]], who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The privileges granted by Mehmed II to his Physician|journal=Bulletin of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|year=1952|volume=14|pages=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohschürmann|first=Michael|title="Die Tore der Freiheit"- Die Dhimma-Politik am Beispiel des jüdischen Milets im Osmanischen Reich und deren Auswirkungen auf die heutigen türkischen Juden|year=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-28937-0|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mehmet II]] imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between "Greeks" and "Jews"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ankori, Zvi (1977). Greek Orthodox Theological Review. 22 (1): 17–57. "Greek Orthodox-Jewish Relations in Historic Perspective: The Jewish View." &lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''rav akçesi'' was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be [[hypothecation|hypothecated]] to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for [[Janissary|janissaries]]; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and [[ispence]]. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; [[Bayezit II]] ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), "''so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman empire|taxes in the Ottoman empire]], rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including [[muafiyet]]; the Jews of Selanik ([[Thessaloniki]]) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by [[Murad II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariadou|first=Elisavet|authorlink=Elizabeth Zachariadou|title=The Via Egnatia under Ottoman rule (1380-1699)|year=1992|publisher=Crete University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19360">In [[mathematics]], the '''Seifert–van Kampen theorem''' of [[algebraic topology]] (named after [[Herbert Seifert]] and [[Egbert van Kampen]]), sometimes just called '''van Kampen's theorem''',  expresses the structure of the [[fundamental group]] of a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the fundamental groups of two open, [[path-connected]] subspaces that cover &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It can therefore be used for computations of the fundamental group of spaces that are constructed out of simpler ones.

== Van Kampen's theorem for fundamental groups&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown, Groupoids and Van Kampen's theorem,  ''Proc. London Math. Soc.'' (3) '''17''' (1967) 385–401. http://planetmath.org/?method=src&amp;from=objects&amp;name=VanKampensTheorem&amp;op=getobj&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Let ''X'' be a topological space which is the union of two open and path connected subspaces ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is path connected and nonempty, and let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a point in ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that will be used as the base of all fundamental groups. The inclusion maps of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ''X'' [[Induced homomorphism (fundamental group)|induce]] group homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;j_1:\pi_1(U_1,x_0)\to \pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j_2:\pi_1(U_2,x_0)\to \pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''X'' is path connected and &lt;math&gt;j_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j_2&lt;/math&gt; form a commutative [[Fibered coproduct|pushout]] diagram:

:[[Image:VanKampen-01.png|750px]]

the natural morphism ''k'' is an isomorphism, that is, the fundamental group of ''X'' is the free product of the fundamental groups of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with amalgamation of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(U_1\cap U_2, x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/697506452|title=Introduction to topological manifolds|last=1950-|first=Lee, John M.,|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=1441979395|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=697506452}} pg. 252, Theorem 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the morphisms induced by inclusion in this theorem are not themselves injective, and the more precise version of the statement is in terms of [[fibered coproduct|pushouts]] of groups.

=== Van Kampen's theorem for fundamental groupoids ===
Unfortunately, the theorem as given above does not compute the fundamental group of the circle, which is the most important basic example in algebraic topology. The reason is that the circle cannot be realised as the union of two open sets with connected intersection. This problem can be resolved by working with the [[fundamental groupoid]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,A)&lt;/math&gt; on a ''set A'' of base points, chosen according to the geometry of the situation. Thus for the circle, one uses two base points.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/vankampenstheorem R. Brown, Groupoids and Van Kampen's theorem, ''Proc. London Math. Soc''. (3) 17 (1967) 385–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[groupoid]] consists of homotopy classes relative to the end points of paths in ''X'' joining points of ''A'' ∩ ''X''. In particular, if ''X'' is a contractible space, and ''A'' consists of two distinct points of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,A)&lt;/math&gt; is easily seen to be isomorphic to the groupoid often written &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; with two vertices and exactly one morphism between any two vertices. This groupoid plays a role in the theory of groupoids analogous to that of the group of integers in the theory of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown. "Groupoids in Mathematics". http://groupoids.org.uk/gpdsweb.html&lt;/ref&gt; The groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; also allows for groupoids a notion of homotopy: it is a ''unit interval object'' in the category of groupoids.

:[[File:Fig6 10c.jpg|thumb|A connected union of two non connected spaces, with set of base points]]

The category of groupoids admits all colimits, and in particular all pushouts.

:'''Theorem.''' Let the topological space ''X'' be covered by the interiors of two subspaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and let ''A'' be a set which meets each path component of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''A'' meets each path component of ''X'' and the diagram '''P''' of morphisms induced by inclusion
::::[[File:SeifertvanKampenPO.PNG|240px]]
:is a pushout diagram in the category of groupoids.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown. ''Topology and Groupoids.'', Booksurge PLC (2006). http://groupoids.org.uk/topgpds.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This theorem  gives the transition from topology to algebra, in determining completely the fundamental groupoid &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,A)&lt;/math&gt;; one then has to use algebra and combinatorics to determine a fundamental group at some basepoint.

One interpretation of the theorem is that it computes homotopy 1-types. To see its utility, one can easily find cases where ''X'' is connected but is the union of the interiors of two subspaces, each with say 402 path components and whose intersection has say 1004 path components. The interpretation of this theorem as a calculational tool for "fundamental groups" needs some development of 'combinatorial groupoid theory'.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/?method=src&amp;from=objects&amp;name=VanKampensTheorem&amp;op=getobj  P.J. Higgins, ''Categories and Groupoids'', van Nostrand, 1971, Reprints of Theory and Applications of Categories, No. 7 (2005),pp 1–195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown, ''Topology and Groupoids.'', Booksurge PLC (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem implies the calculation of the  fundamental group of the circle as the group of integers, since the group of integers is obtained from the groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; by identifying, in the category of groupoids, its two vertices.

There is a version of the last theorem when ''X'' is covered by the union of the interiors of a family &lt;math&gt;\{U_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda\}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown, Philip J. Higgins and Rafael Sivera. ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids'', European Mathematical Society Tracts vol 15, August, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higher-dimensional, generalized van Kampen theorems (HD-GVKT) http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/HDGvKTVanKampenTheorems.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusion is that if ''A'' meets each path component of all 1,2,3-fold intersections of the sets &lt;math&gt;U_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then ''A'' meets all path components of ''X'' and the diagram

:&lt;math&gt;\bigsqcup_{(\lambda,\mu) \in \Lambda^2} \pi_1(U_\lambda \cap U_\mu, A) \rightrightarrows \bigsqcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \pi_1(U_\lambda, A)\rightarrow \pi_1(X,A)&lt;/math&gt;

of morphisms induced by inclusions is a [[coequaliser]] in the category of groupoids.

== Equivalent formulations ==
In the language of [[combinatorial group theory]], if &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt; is a topological space; &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are open, path connected subspaces of &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;U\cap V&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty and path-connected; and &lt;math&gt;w\in U\cap V&lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[free product with amalgamation]] of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(U,w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(V,w)&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the (not necessarily injective) homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;I:\pi_1(U\cap V, w)\to \pi_1(U,w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J:\pi_1(U\cap V, w)\to \pi_1(V,w)&lt;/math&gt;.  Given [[group presentation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi_1(U,w) &amp;= \langle u_1,\cdots,u_k \mid\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_l\rangle \\
\pi_1(V,w) &amp;= \langle v_1,\cdots,v_m \mid \beta_1,\cdots,\beta_n\rangle \\
\pi_1(U\cap V,w) &amp;= \langle w_1,\cdots,w_p \mid \gamma_1,\cdots,\gamma_q\rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the amalgamation can be presented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/697506452|title=Introduction to topological manifolds|last=1950-|first=Lee, John M.,|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=1441979395|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=697506452}} pg. 253, Theorem 10.3.&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,w) = \left \langle u_1,\cdots,u_k, v_1,\cdots,v_m \left | \alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_l, \beta_1,\cdots,\beta_n, I(w_1)J(w_1)^{-1},\cdots,I(w_p)J(w_p)^{-1} \right. \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[category theory]], &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pushout (mathematics)|pushout]], in the category of groups, of the diagram:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(U,w)\gets\pi_1(U\cap V,w)\to\pi_1(V,w).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
=== 2-Sphere ===
One can use Van Kampen's theorem to calculate fundamental groups for topological spaces that can be decomposed into simpler spaces. For example, consider the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;. Pick open sets &lt;math&gt;A=S^2\setminus \{n\} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=S^2\setminus \{s\}&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' and ''s'' denote the north and south poles respectively. Then we have the property that ''A'', ''B'' and ''A'' ∩ ''B'' are open path connected sets. Thus we can see that there is a commutative diagram including ''A'' ∩ ''B'' into ''A'' and ''B'' and then another inclusion from ''A'' and ''B'' into &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; and that there is a corresponding diagram of homomorphisms between the fundamental groups of each subspace. Applying Van Kampen's theorem gives the result

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^2)=\pi_1(A)\cdot\pi_1(B)/\ker(\Phi).&lt;/math&gt;

However ''A'' and ''B'' are both homeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is simply connected, so both ''A'' and ''B'' have trivial fundamental groups. It is clear from this that the fundamental group of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is trivial.

=== Wedge Sum of Spaces ===
Given two based spaces &lt;math&gt;(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Y,y)&lt;/math&gt; we can form their wedge &lt;math&gt;(X\vee Y,p)&lt;/math&gt; by taking the quotient of &lt;math&gt;X \coprod Y&lt;/math&gt; by identifying their two basepoints. Since the fundamental group of a point is trivial, the Van Kampen theorem shows that
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi_1(X\vee Y,p) \cong \pi_1(X,x)*\pi_1(Y,y)
&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism of groups.

=== Orientable Genus g Surfaces ===

A more complicated example is the calculation of the fundamental group of a [[genus (mathematics)#Orientable surface|genus ''n'' orientable surface]] ''S'', otherwise known as the ''genus n surface group''. One can construct ''S'' using its [[Fundamental polygon#Standard fundamental polygons|standard fundamental polygon]]. For the first open set ''A'', pick a disk within the center of the polygon. Pick ''B'' to be the complement in ''S'' of the center point of ''A''. Then the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' is an annulus, which is known to be [[homotopy equivalent]] to (and so has the same fundamental group as) a circle. Then &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(A \cap B)=\pi_1(S^1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the integers, and &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(A)=\pi_1(D^2)={1}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(A \cap  B)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; sends any generator to the trivial element. However, the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(A \cap  B)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(B)&lt;/math&gt; is not trivial. In order to understand this, first one must calculate &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This is easily done as one can [[deformation retract]] ''B'' (which is ''S'' with one point deleted) onto the edges labeled by

:&lt;math&gt; A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1} A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1} \cdots A_n B_n A_n^{-1} B_n^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This space is known to be the [[wedge sum]] of 2''n'' circles (also called a [[bouquet of circles]]), which further is known to have fundamental group isomorphic to the [[free group]] with 2''n'' generators, which in this case can be represented by the edges themselves: &lt;math&gt;\{A_1,B_1,\cdots,A_n,B_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. We now have enough information to apply Van Kampen's theorem. The generators are the loops &lt;math&gt;\{A_1,B_1,\cdots,A_n,B_n\}&lt;/math&gt; (''A'' is simply connected, so it contributes no generators) and there is exactly one relation:

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1} A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1} \cdots A_n B_n A_n^{-1} B_n^{-1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Using generators and relations, this group is denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle A_1,B_1,\cdots,A_n,B_n\left | A_1B_1A_1^{-1}B_1^{-1}\cdots A_nB_nA_n^{-1}B_n^{-1}\right. \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
As explained above, this theorem was  extended by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] to the non-connected case by using the fundamental groupoid &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 (X,A)&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''A'' of base points.  The theorem for arbitrary covers, with the restriction that ''A'' meets all threefold intersections of the sets of the cover, is given in the paper by Brown and Abdul Razak Salleh.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald and Razak Salleh, Abdul, "A van Kampen theorem for unions of nonconnected spaces". [[Archiv der Mathematik]] (Basel) 42 (1984), no. 1, 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorem and  proof for the fundamental group, but using some groupoid methods, are also given in  [[J. Peter May]]'s book.&lt;ref&gt;May, J. Peter, "A Concise Introduction to Algebraic Topology", chapter 2, (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;   The version that allows more than two overlapping sets but with ''A'' a singleton is also given in [[Allen Hatcher]]'s book below, theorem 1.20.

Applications of the fundamental groupoid on a set of base points to the [[Jordan curve theorem]], [[covering space]]s, and [[orbit space]]s are given in Ronald Brown's book.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald, "Topology and Groupoids", Booksurge, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of orbit spaces, it is convenient to take ''A'' to include all the fixed points of the action. An example here is the conjugation action on the circle.

References to higher-dimensional versions of the theorem which yield some information on homotopy types are given in an article on higher-dimensional group theories and groupoids.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown. "Higher-dimensional group theory" . 2007. http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/hdaweb2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a 2-dimensional van Kampen theorem which computes nonabelian second relative homotopy groups was given by Ronald Brown and Philip J. Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald and Higgins, Philip J. "On the connection between the second relative homotopy groups of some related spaces'', [[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]] (3) 36 (1978), 193-212.&lt;/ref&gt; A full account and extensions to all dimensions are given by Brown, Higgins, and Rafael Sivera,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald, Higgins, Philip J., and Sivera, Rafael, "Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids", EMS Tracts in Mathematics vol 15, 20011. http://groupoids.org.uk/nonab-a-t.html&lt;/ref&gt; while an extension to ''n''-cubes of spaces is given by Ronald Brown and [[Jean-Louis Loday]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald and Loday, Jean-Louis, "Van Kampen theorems for diagrams of spaces'',  Topology 26 (1987), 311–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental groups also appear in algebraic geometry and are the main topic of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s first [[Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie|Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]] (SGA1). A version of van Kampen's theorem appears there, and is proved along quite different lines than in algebraic topology, namely by descent theory. A similar proof works in algebraic topology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrien Douady|Douady, Adrien]] and Douady, Régine, "Algèbre et théories galoisiennes", Cassini (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16671">In mathematics, a '''join-semilattice''' (or '''upper semilattice''') is a [[partially ordered set]] that has a [[join (mathematics)|join]] (a [[least upper bound]]) for any [[nonempty set|nonempty]] [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]. [[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a '''meet-semilattice''' (or '''lower semilattice''') is a partially ordered set which has a [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] (or [[greatest lower bound]]) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the [[inverse order]] and vice versa.

Semilattices can also be defined [[algebra|algebraically]]: join and meet are [[associativity|associative]], [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[binary operation]]s, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order. 

A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to the same partial order. Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding [[absorption law]]s.

{{Algebraic structures |Lattice}}

== Order-theoretic definition ==

A [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by the [[binary relation]] ≤ is a ''meet-semilattice'' if

: For all elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S'', the [[infimum|greatest lower bound]] of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} exists.

The greatest lower bound of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} is called the [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}.

Replacing "greatest lower bound" with "[[supremum|least upper bound]]" results in the dual concept of a ''join-semilattice''. The least upper bound of {''x'', ''y''} is called the [[Join (mathematics)|join]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}}. Meet and join are [[binary operation]]s on ''S''. A simple [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument shows that the existence of all possible pairwise suprema (infima), as per the definition, implies the existence of all non-empty finite suprema (infima).

A join-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[least element]], the join of the empty set. [[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a meet-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[greatest element]], the meet of the empty set.

Other properties may be assumed; see the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness in order theory]] for more discussion on this subject. That article also discusses how we may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related posets — an approach of special interest for [[category theory|category theoretic]] investigations of the concept.

== Algebraic definition ==
A "meet-semilattice" is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\langle S, \land \rangle&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' with a [[binary operation]] ∧, called '''meet''', such that for all members ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' of ''S'', the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] hold:

;[[Associativity]]: ''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') = (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∧ ''z''
;[[Commutativity]]: ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''y'' ∧ ''x''
;[[Idempotency]]: ''x'' ∧ ''x'' = ''x''
A meet-semilattice &lt;math&gt;\langle S, \land \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is '''bounded''' if ''S'' includes an [[identity element]] 1 such that {{nowrap begin}}''x'' ∧ 1 = ''x''{{nowrap end}} for all ''x'' in ''S''. 

If the symbol ∨, called '''join''', replaces ∧ in the definition just given, the structure is called a ''join-semilattice''. One can be ambivalent about the particular choice of symbol for the operation, and speak simply of ''semilattices''.

A semilattice is a [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[semigroup]], i.e., a commutative [[band (mathematics)|band]]. A bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative [[monoid]].

A partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting {{nowrap|''x''≤''y''}} whenever ''x''∧''y''=''x''. For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting {{nowrap|''x''≤''y''}} whenever ''x''∨''y''=''y''. In a bounded meet-semilattice, the identity 1 is the greatest element of ''S''. Similarly, an identity element in a join semilattice is a least element.

== Connection between both definitions ==
An order theoretic meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ≤&amp;rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary operation]] ∧ such that {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} is an algebraic meet-semilattice. Conversely, the meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary relation]] ≤ that partially orders ''S'' in the following way: for all elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''y''.

The relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering from which the binary operation ∧ may be recovered. Conversely, the order induced by the algebraically defined semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} coincides with that induced by ≤.

Hence both definitions may be used interchangeably, depending on which one is more convenient for a particular purpose. A similar conclusion holds for join-semilattices and the dual ordering ≥.

== Examples ==
Semilattices are employed to construct other order structures, or in conjunction with other completeness properties.
* A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. The interaction of these two semilattices via the [[absorption law]] is what truly distinguishes a lattice from a semilattice.
* The [[compact element]]s of an algebraic [[lattice (order)|lattice]], under the induced partial ordering, form a bounded join-semilattice.
* Any finite semilattice is bounded, by induction.
* A [[totally ordered set]] is a [[distributive lattice]], hence in particular a meet-semilattice and join-semilattice: any two distinct elements have a greater and lesser one, which are their meet and join.
** A [[well-ordered set]] is further a ''bounded'' meet-semilattice, as the set as a whole has a least element, hence it is bounded.
*** The nonnegative integers ℕ, with their usual order ≤, are a bounded meet-semilattice, with least element 0, although they have no greatest element: they are the smallest infinite well-ordered set.
* Any single-rooted [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] (with the single root as the least element) of height &lt;math&gt;\leq \omega&lt;/math&gt; is a meet-semilattice. Consider for example the set of finite words over some alphabet, ordered by the [[prefix order]]. It has a least element (the empty word) but no greatest element, and the root is the meet of all other elements.
* A [[Scott domain]] is a meet-semilattice.
* Membership in any set ''L'' can  be taken as a [[model theory|model]] of a semilattice with base set ''L'', because a semilattice captures the essence of set [[extensionality]]. Let ''a''∧''b'' denote ''a''∈''L'' &amp; ''b''∈''L''. Two sets differing only in one or both of the:
# Order in which their members are listed;
# Multiplicity of one or more members,
:are in fact the same set. Commutativity and associativity of ∧ assure (1), [[idempotence]], (2). This semilattice is the [[free semilattice]] over ''L''.  It is not bounded by ''L'', because a set is not a member of itself.
* Classical extensional [[mereology]] defines a join-semilattice, with join read as binary fusion. This semilattice is bounded from above by the world individual.

== Semilattice morphisms ==
The above algebraic definition of a semilattice suggests a notion of [[morphism]] between two semilattices. Given two join-semilattices {{nowrap|(''S'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''T'', ∨)}}, a [[homomorphism]] of (join-) semilattices is a function ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' such that

:''f''(''x'' ∨ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') ∨ ''f''(''y'').

Hence ''f'' is just a homomorphism of the two [[semigroups]] associated with each semilattice. If ''S'' and ''T'' both include a least element 0, then ''f'' should also be a [[monoid]] homomorphism, i.e. we additionally require that

: ''f''(0) = 0.

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of join-semilattices is a function that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserves binary joins]] and least elements, if such there be. The obvious dual—replacing ∧ with ∨ and 0 with 1—transforms this definition of a join-semilattice homomorphism into its meet-semilattice equivalent.

Note that any semilattice homomorphism is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation. For an explanation see the entry [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]].

== Equivalence with algebraic lattices ==

There is a well-known [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of join-semilattices with zero with &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-homomorphisms and the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of [[algebraic lattice]]s with [[compact element|compactness]]-preserving complete join-homomorphisms, as follows. With a join-semilattice &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with zero, we associate its ideal lattice &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}\ S&lt;/math&gt;. With a &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon S \to T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-semilattices, we associate the map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}\ f \colon \operatorname{Id}\ S \to \operatorname{Id}\ T&lt;/math&gt;, that with any ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; associates the ideal of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;f(I)&lt;/math&gt;. This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id} \colon \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, with every algebraic lattice &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we associate the &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-semilattice &lt;math&gt;K(A)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[compact element]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and with every compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; between algebraic lattices we associate the restriction &lt;math&gt;K(f) \colon K(A) \to K(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;K \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The pair &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Id},K)&lt;/math&gt; defines a category equivalence between &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Distributive semilattices ==
Surprisingly, there is a notion of "distributivity" applicable to semilattices, even though distributivity conventionally requires the interaction of two binary operations. This notion requires but a single operation, and generalizes the distributivity condition for lattices. A join-semilattice is '''distributive''' if for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''x'' with {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;le; ''a'' &amp;or; ''b''}} there exist {{nowrap|''a' '' &amp;le; ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''b' '' &amp;le; ''b''}} such that {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''a' '' &amp;or; ''b' ''.{{nowrap end}} Distributive meet-semilattices are defined dually. These definitions are justified by the fact that any distributive join-semilattice in which binary meets exist is a distributive lattice. See the entry [[distributivity (order theory)]].

A join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its [[ideal (order theory)|ideals]] (under inclusion) is distributive.

== Complete semilattices ==
Nowadays, the term "complete semilattice" has no generally accepted meaning, and various inconsistent definitions exist. If completeness is taken to require the existence of all infinite joins, or all infinite meets, whichever the case may be, as well as finite ones, this immediately leads to partial orders that are in fact [[complete lattice]]s. For why the existence of all possible infinite joins entails the existence of all possible infinite meets (and vice versa), see the entry [[completeness (order theory)]].

Nevertheless, the literature on occasion still takes complete join- or meet-semilattices to be complete lattices. In this case, "completeness" denotes a restriction on the scope of the [[homomorphism]]s. Specifically, a complete join-semilattice requires that the homomorphisms preserve all joins, but contrary to the situation we find for completeness properties, this does not require that homomorphisms preserve all meets. On the other hand, we can conclude that every such mapping is the lower adjoint of some [[Galois connection]]. The corresponding (unique) upper adjoint will then be a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices. This gives rise to a number of useful [[duality (category theory)|categorical dualities]] between the categories of all complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all meets or joins, respectively.

Another usage of "complete meet-semilattice" refers to a [[bounded complete]] [[Complete partial order|cpo]]. A complete meet-semilattice in this sense is arguably the "most complete" meet-semilattice that is not necessarily a complete lattice. Indeed, a complete meet-semilattice has all ''non-empty'' meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. Thus a complete semilattice turns out to be "a complete lattice possibly lacking a top". This definition is of interest specifically in [[domain theory]], where bounded complete [[algebraic poset|algebraic]] cpos are studied as [[Scott domain]]s. Hence Scott domains have been called ''algebraic semilattices''.

Cardinality-restricted notions of completeness for semilattices have been rarely considered in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Manes, ''Algebraic theories'', Graduate Texts in Mathematics Volume 26, Springer 1976, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/completesemilattice complete semilattices] on Planetmath.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free semilattices ==

This section presupposes some knowledge of [[category theory]]. In various situations, [[free object|free]] semilattices exist. For example, the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of join-semilattices (and their homomorphisms) to the [[category theory|category]] of sets (and functions) admits a [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]]. Therefore, the free join-semilattice '''F'''(''S'') over a set ''S'' is constructed by taking the collection of all non-empty ''finite'' [[subset]]s of ''S'', ordered by subset inclusion. Clearly, ''S'' can be embedded into '''F'''(''S'') by a mapping ''e'' that takes any element ''s'' in ''S'' to the singleton set {''s''}. Then any function ''f'' from a ''S'' to a join-semilattice ''T'' (more formally, to the underlying set of ''T'') induces a unique homomorphism ''f' '' between the join-semilattices '''F'''(''S'') and ''T'', such that ''f'' = ''f' '' o ''e''. Explicitly, ''f' '' is given by ''f' ''(''A'') = &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;{''f''(''s'') | ''s'' in ''A''}. Now the obvious uniqueness of ''f' '' suffices to obtain the required adjunction—the morphism-part of the functor '''F''' can be derived from general considerations (see [[adjoint functors]]). The case of free meet-semilattices is dual, using the opposite subset inclusion as an ordering. For join-semilattices with bottom, we just add the empty set to the above collection of subsets.

In addition, semilattices often serve as generators for free objects within other categories. Notably, both the forgetful functors from the category of [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] and frame-homomorphisms, and from the category of distributive lattices and lattice-homomorphisms, have a left adjoint.

'''Sustainability measurement''' is the quantitative basis for the informed management of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-357-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T. et al. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Simon  and Morse, Stephen 2008. ''Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable?'' 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-299-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]]. An alternative approach, used by the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is [[Circles of Sustainability]].

==Sustainability indicators and their function==
The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Boulanger, P. M. (2008) "Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue". '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The [[European Environment Agency]] uses a slight modification of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] [[DPSIR]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stanners, D. et al. 2007. ''Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA.'' In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) ''(D)rive'' or initiate environmental ''(P)ressures'' which, in turn, produces a change in the ''(S)tate'' of the environment which leads to ''(I)mpacts'' of various kinds. Societal ''(R)esponses'' (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.

==Metrics at the global scale==

===United Nations Indicators===
The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/isd.htm] United Nations sustainable development indicators&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp], [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.===
In the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability — including measures of resource use like [[life cycle assessment]], measures of consumption like the [[ecological footprint]] and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the [[Environmental Performance Index]]. The following is a list of quantitative "tools" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.

===Resource metrics===
Part of this process can relate to resource use such as [[energy accounting]] or to economic metrics or [[price system]] values as compared to [[non-market economics]] potential, for understanding resource use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Net_energy_analysis |title=Net energy analysis |publisher=Eoearth.org |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important task for resource theory ([[energy economics]]) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision Making, Science, and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - A Useful Concept.Intro |publisher=Exergy.se |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the [[Industrial Revolution]], and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_and_economic_myths_(historical) |title=Energy and economic myths (historical) |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics, oil and energy====
[[Image:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.

Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to [[Ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

====Growth-based economic models====

Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. [[M. King Hubbert]] believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html How peak oil could lead to starvation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818060558/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and [[Mario Giampietro]], senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taggart |first=Adam |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The [[Peak oil|peaking of global oil]] along with the decline in regional [[natural gas]] production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbert peaks==
Although [[Hubbert peak theory]] receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley (p.&amp;nbsp;189) predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview
|first=R.W. |last=Bentley |journal=Energy Policy |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=189–205 |year=2002 |url=http://www.oilcrisis.com/bentley/depletionOverview.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(01)00144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the USA, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html GEO 3005: Earth Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085800/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted—far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Rosie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml" /&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41].
&lt;/ref&gt; This
implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

Finally, insofar as global [[peak oil]] and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, considerably extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025195932/http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.}}

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063107/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Metals===
{{Main|Peak copper}}
Hubbert applied his theory to "rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976 |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and others would occur in the time frame of decades and [[iron]] in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007].

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus]] supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apda.pt/apda_resources/APDA.Biblioteca/eureau%5Cposition%20papers%5Cthe%20reuse%20of%20phosphorus.pdf |title=APDA |publisher=Apda.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual countries supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America's supply &lt;ref&gt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/phospmcs06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is estimated around 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecosanres.org/PDF%20files/Fact_sheets/ESR4lowres.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805112847/http://ecosanres.org/PDF%20files/Fact_sheets/ESR4lowres.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol.

===Peak water===
{{Main|Peak water}}
Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources.  However [[over-exploitation]] often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless.  A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, a reserve such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]] can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment.  This turns much of the world's underground water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcsupply/6worllarg2.html |title=WorldŐs largest acquifer going dry |publisher=Uswaternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209034549/http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcsupply/6worllarg2.html |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lakes &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/2005/Update47_data.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720005108/http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/2005/Update47_data.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil.  These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive.  The term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

===Renewable resources===
*'''Fisheries''': At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization ([[Hubbert curve]]) on the [[whaling]] industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspoitalia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=39 |title=How General is the Hubbert Curve? |publisher=Aspoitalia.net |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[cod]] of the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/laherrere/multihub.htm |title=Laherrere: Multi-Hubbert Modeling |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison of the cases of fisheries and of mineral extraction tells us that the human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a depletion cycle which follows a Hubbert curve.

'''"The Masque of Anarchy"''' (or "The Mask of Anarchy") is a British political poem written in 1819 (see [[1819 in poetry]]) by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] following the [[Peterloo massacre]] of that year. In his call for freedom, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of [[nonviolent resistance]].

The poem was not published during Shelley's lifetime and did not appear in print until 1832 (see [[1832 in poetry]]), when published by Edward Moxon in London with a preface by [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]].&lt;ref name=cocel&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Cox |editor-first=Michael |title=The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=0-19-860634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley had sent the manuscript in 1819 for publication in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]''. Leigh Hunt withheld it from publication because he "thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind-heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse." The epigraph on the cover of the first edition is from ''[[The Revolt of Islam]]'' (1818): "Hope is strong; Justice and Truth their winged child have found."

Use of ''masque'' and ''mask'' is discussed by Morton Paley;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morton D. |last=Paley |title=Apocalypse and Millennium in English Romantic Poetry |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-19169-882-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley used ''mask'' in the manuscript but the first edition uses ''masque'' in the title.

==Synopsis==
Shelley begins his poem, written on the occasion of the [[Peterloo massacre]], Manchester 1819, with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time, "God, and King, and Law" – and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action: "Let a great assembly be, of the fearless, of the free". The crowd at this gathering is met by armed soldiers, but the protesters do not raise an arm against their assailants:

:''"Stand ye calm and resolute,''
:''Like a forest close and mute,''
:''With folded arms and looks which are''
:''Weapons of unvanquished war.''

:''And if then the tyrants dare,''
:''Let them ride among you there;''
:''Slash, and stab, and maim and hew;''
:''What they like, that let them do.''

:''With folded arms and steady eyes,''
:''And little fear, and less surprise,''
:''Look upon them as they slay,''
:''Till their rage has died away:''

:''Then they will return with shame,''
:''To the place from which they came,''
:''And the blood thus shed will speak''
:''In hot blushes on their cheek:''

:''Rise, like lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number!''
:''Shake your chains to earth like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you:''
:''Ye are many—they are few!"''&lt;ref name="masque"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelley |first=Percy Bysshe |editor-first=Mrs. |editor-last=Shelley |editor-link=Mary Shelley |title=The works of Percy Bysshe Shelley |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iIgU7b6j6kcC&amp;pg=PA231 |date=1847 |pages=231–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley elaborates on the psychological consequences of violence met with pacifism. The guilty soldiers he says, will return shamefully to society, where "blood thus shed will speak / In hot blushes on their cheek". Women will point out the murderers on the streets, their former friends will shun them, and honourable soldiers will turn away from those responsible for the massacre, "ashamed of such base company". A version was taken up by [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|''Civil Disobedience'']], and later by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] in his doctrine of ''[[Satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Liberationist Sexuality and Nonviolent Resistance: The Legacy of Blake and Shelley in Morris's News From Nowhere |first=Ashton |last=Nichols |journal=[[Journal of William Morris Studies]] |volume=10 |number=4 |date=1994 |pages=20-27 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's [[nonviolence]] in protest and political action.&lt;ref name="Weber-Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Weber |title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |pages=28–29 |isbn=978-0-52184-230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's "The Masque of Anarchy" to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber-Gandhi"/&gt;

The poem mentions several members of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s government by name: the Foreign Secretary, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who appears as a mask worn by Murder, the Home Secretary, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]], whose guise is taken by [[Hypocrisy]], and the Lord Chancellor, [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]], whose ermine gown is worn by Fraud. Led by Anarchy, a skeleton with a crown, they try to take over England, but are slain by a mysterious armoured figure who arises from a mist. The maiden [[Hope]], revived, then calls to the people of England:

:''"Men of England, heirs of Glory,''
:''Heroes of unwritten story,''
:''Nurslings of one mighty Mother,''
:''Hopes of her, and one another!''

:''What is Freedom? Ye can tell''
:''That which Slavery is too well,''
:''For its very name has grown''
:''To an echo of your own''

:''Let a vast assembly be,''
:''And with great solemnity''
:''Declare with measured words, that ye''
:''Are, as God has made ye, free.''

:''The old laws of England—they''
:''Whose reverend heads with age are grey,''
:''Children of a wiser day;''
:''And whose solemn voice must be''
:''Thine own echo—Liberty!''

:''Rise, like lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number!''
:''Shake your chains to earth, like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you:''
:''Ye are many—they are few!"''&lt;ref name="masque"/&gt;

==Literary criticism==
Political authors and campaigners such as [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]] and [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]], among others, describe it as "the greatest political poem ever written in English".&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dC8_eLftKwC&amp;pg=PA532 |title=Shelley: The Pursuit |first=Richard |last=Holmes |authorlink=Richard Holmes (biographer) |publisher=New York Review Books |year=2003 |origyear=1974 |page=532 |isbn=1-59017-037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foot"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/46/shelley.shtml |authorlink=Paul Foot (journalist) |first=Paul |last=Foot |title=Shelley: Trumpet of Prophecy |journal=International Socialist Review | issue=46 |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', [[Aldous Huxley]] noted the poem's exhortation to the English to resist assault without fighting back, stating "The Method of resistance inculcated in by Shelley in ''The Mask of Anarchy'' (sic) is the method of non-violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aldous |last=Huxley |authorlink=Aldous Huxley |chapter=Shelley |title=An Encyclopedia of Pacifism |location=London |publisher=Chatto and Windus, in association with the [[Peace Pledge Union]] |year=1937 |pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author, educator, and activist [[Howard Zinn]] refers to the poem in ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. In a subsequent interview, he underscored the power of the poem, suggesting: "What a remarkable affirmation of the power of people who seem to have no power. Ye are many, they are few. It has always seemed to me that poetry, music, literature, contribute very special power."&lt;ref name="zinn1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780060844257 |first=Howard |last=Zinn |authorlink=Howard Zinn |title=Original Zinn: Conversations on History and Politics |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=0060844256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Zinn uses "The Mask of Anarchy" as an example of literature that members of the American labour movement would read to other workers to inform and educate them.

==Use in politics==
The rallying language of the poem had led to elements of it being used by political movements. It was recited by students at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and by protesters in [[Tahrir Square]] during the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/for-the-man-jeremy-corbyn-percy-bysshe-shelley/ |last=Mulhallen |first=Jacqueline |date=2017 |title=For the Many, Not the Few: Jeremy Corbyn and Percy Bysshe Shelley |website=Pluto Books |accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number" from the poem is used as a motto/slogan by the [[International Socialist Organization]] in their organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isreview.org/issue |title=Issues |website=International Socialist Review.org |accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line "Ye are many-they are few" inspired the campaign slogan "We are many, they are few" used by protesters during the [[Poll tax riots]] of 1989–90 in the United Kingdom, and also inspired the title of the 2014 documentary film ''[[We Are Many (film)|We Are Many]]'', which focused on the global [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/rise-lions-after-slumber-why-do-jeremy-corbyn-and-co-keep-reciting-19th-century |title="Rise like lions after slumber": why do Jeremy Corbyn and co keep reciting a 19th century poem? |last=Chakelian |first=Anoosh |date=27 June 2017 |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Corbyn]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]], quoted the final stanza from the poem at his rally in [[Islington]], on the final day of campaigning for the [[2017 UK general election]]. Corbyn subsequently quoted the final stanza again during his speech at the [[Pyramid stage]] at the 2017 [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/jeremy-corbyn-glastonbury-speech-read-full-pyramid-stage-crowd-size-a7806691.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury: Read Labour leader's Pyramid Stage speech in full |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=24 June 2017 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic and writer [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] has suggested that the title of the party's 2017 manifesto, "For the Many, Not the Few", was derived from the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/londoners-diary-jeremy-corbyns-romantic-notions-traced-back-to-percy-shelley-a3541276.html |title=Londoner's Diary: Jeremy Corbyn's Romantic notions traced back to Percy Shelley |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=17 May 2017 |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase 'a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few' also appears in the revised version of [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/clause-iv-of-labour-party-constitution-what-is-all-the-fuss-about-reinstating-it |title=Clause IV: a brief history |first=Aisha |last=Gani |date=9 August 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same variation, "For The Many, Not The Few", was the sub-title to [[Robert Reich]]'s 2016 book, ''[[Saving Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/robert-reichs-saving-capitalism.html |title=Robert Reich's 'Saving Capitalism' |last=Griswold |first=Alison |date=15 November 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Lines from the poem are quoted on the sleeve of [[The Jam]]'s 1980 album ''[[Sound Affects]]''.

Lines from the poem inspired and are featured in the [[John Vanderslice]] song ''Pale Horse''.

The poem's lines "like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number" are quoted by the title and closing lines of the [[Scritti Politti]] song "[[Songs to Remember|Lions After Slumber]]". They are also referenced in the opening lines of the song "Blaze" by [[Strike Anywhere]].

The chorus of the song "Robin Hood" by [[The Mekons]] contains the lines "Rise like lions, shake your chains, babe. Ye are many, they are few".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mekons.de/lyrics/robin.htm |title=Robin Hood |website=Mekons.de |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' titled "The Heart of a Man", the character played by [[Jeff Hordley]], Stan Keaton, quotes the last verse in its entirety whilst standing outside the Aidensfield Arms with his fellow sacked workers.

There is also a two-fluid model which helps explain the behavior of [[superfluid]] [[helium]].  This model states that there will be two components in liquid helium below its [[lambda point]] (the temperature where superfluid forms).  These components are a normal fluid and a superfluid component.  Each liquid has a different density and together their sum makes the total density, which remains constant.  The ratio of superfluid density to the total density increases as the temperature approaches absolute zero.

A '''unicase''' or '''unicameral''' [[alphabet]] is one that has no [[Letter case|case]] for its letters.  [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], [[Tamil alphabet|Tamil]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Old_Hungarian_script|Old Hungarian]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Wikipedia articles on [[Letter case]] and Unicase differ in their view of whether [[Old Hungarian alphabet]] actually has letter case distinction.}} [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], and [[Hangul]] are unicase alphabets, while (modern) [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]] are ''bicameral'', as they have two cases for each letter, e.g., B/b, Β/β, Б/б, Բ/բ. Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, [[ʻokina]] ('''{{okina}}'''), used in Polynesian languages, and [[glottal stop (letter)|glottal stop]] ('''ʔ''') as used in [[Nootka language|Nuu-chah-nuulth]].

All alphabets with case were once unicase.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Latin, for example, used to be written with a unicase alphabet in [[Roman Empire|imperial Roman times]]; it was only later that scribes developed new sets of symbols for running text, which became the lower case of the Latin alphabet, while the letterforms of Ancient Rome came to be called capitals or upper case.

The [[Georgian alphabet]], on the other hand, has developed in the other direction: in the medieval period, Georgian also had two sets of letters available for bicameral writing, but the use of two cases later gave way to a unicameral system. The ecclesiastical form of the Georgian alphabet, [[Khutsuri]], had an upper case called [[Asomtavruli]] (like the Ancient Roman capitals) and a lower case called [[Nuskhuri]] (like the medieval Latin scribal forms). Out of Nuskhuri came a secular alphabet called [[Georgian alphabet#Mkhedruli|Mkhedruli]], which is the unicase Georgian alphabet in use today.

A unicase version of the Latin alphabet was proposed by Michael Mann and David Dalby in 1982 as a variation of the Niamey [[African reference alphabet#1982 version|African Reference Alphabet]]. This version has apparently never been actively used. Another example of unicase Latin alphabet is the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]. Occasionally some fonts use unicase designs to create an unusual effect; this was particularly popular in the 1960s.

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] only uses lowercase Latin (and Greek) letters and some scaled upper-case letters ([[small caps]]), effectively making it a unicase alphabet, although it is not used for actual writing of any language.

The '''United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs''' ('''UN DESA''') is part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] and is responsible for the follow-up to major United Nations Summits and Conferences, as well as services to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the Second and Third Committees of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="bio2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/ousg/#bioSection| title=About Mr. Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN DESA assists countries around the world in [[agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]] and decision-making with the goal of meeting their economic, social and environmental challenges. It supports international cooperation to promote sustainable development for all, having as a foundation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] ('''SDGs''') as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice, and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and continues to play a key role in monitoring progress towards internationally agreed-upon development goals. It is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
UN DESA is part of the UN Secretariat, which is funded through regular assessed contributions from Member States. The Department was reorganized into its present form in 1997. The Department is headed by Liu Zhenmin who assumed the office of Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, following his appointment to this position by Secretary-General António Guterres on 26 July 2017. Mr. Liu advises the Secretary-General on the three pillars of sustainable development—social economic and environmental, and nurtures key partnerships with governments, UN agencies and civil society organizations, including the SDGs. In directing and managing UN DESA, the Under-Secretary-General is supported by the Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.

== Mission ==
UN DESA’s mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] for all, focusing on the most vulnerable. This reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. It underscores the need for all stakeholders – governments, UN and other international organizations, civil society and the private sector – to do their part to improve economic and social well-being. This emphasis on equitable participation by all people and nations is what makes the United Nations unique and gives the development agenda its universal legitimacy.

== Function ==
UN DESA’s work programme can be categorized into three areas:

[[File:Sdgdesa.jpg|thumb|550px|frame|right|Adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015]]

'''Norm-setting''': 
By facilitating major global conferences and summits, as mandated by [[UN Member States]], UN DESA assists countries as they find common ground and take decisive steps forward. Specifically, UN DESA is tasked with supporting deliberations in two major UN charter bodies: the UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), including ECOSOC’s subsidiary bodies. 
In addition, UN DESA organises and supports consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. In this regard, UN DESA’s main priorities are promoting progress toward and strengthening accountability in achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, UN DESA is responsible for ensuring civil society engagement with the UN through the ECOSOC bodies.

'''Data and Analysis''':
UN DESA, generates, analyzes and compiles a wide range of official economic, social and environmental data and information on which Member States draw to review common problems and to take stock of policy options. One of the Department’s primary contributions is providing policy research and analysis for governments to use in their deliberations and decision-making&lt;ref name="SDG Indicators Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/| title=DESA's flagship data resources and analytic publications|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UN DESA is also the lead “author” Department of the UN Secretariat. The research and analytical work covers a range of economic, social and environmental issues. The Department  produces a host of flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports, which are essential to UN negotiations and global policy decisions. The publications are distributed in print and electronic formats around the world.

'''Capacity-building''':
UN DESA also advises Member States / Governments on implementing the policies and programmes developed at UN conferences back in their home countries. It assists interested Governments in translating policy frameworks developed in UN conferences and summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities.

Unlike other library classification schemes that have started their life as national systems, the UDC was conceived and maintained as an international scheme. Its translation in world languages started at the beginning of the 20th century and has since been published in various printed editions in over 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=editions UDC Editions], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=UDC Translations: a 2004 Survey Report and Bibliography |journal=Extensions &amp; Corrections to the UDC |date=November 2004 |volume=26 |issue=2004 |pages=58–80 |ref=harv  |language=en|hdl=10150/106363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDC Summary, an abridged Web version of the scheme is available in over 50 languages.&lt;ref name="UDCS" /&gt; The classification has been modified and extended over the years to cope with increasing output in all areas of human knowledge, and is still under continuous review to take account of new developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=major_revisions Major Revisions of the UDC 1993-2013], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic, A. |last2=Cordeiro, M.

Albeit originally designed as an indexing and retrieval system, due to its logical structure and scalability, UDC has become one of the most widely used knowledge organization systems in libraries, where it is used for either shelf arrangement, content indexing or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=UDC implementation: from library shelves to a structured indexing language |journal=International Cataloguing and Bibliographic Control |date=2004 |volume=33.3 |issue=2004 |pages=60–65 |ref=harv |language=en|hdl=10150/105685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDC codes can describe any type of document or object to any desired level of detail. These can include textual documents and other media such as [[film]]s, [[video]] and [[sound]] recordings, [[illustration]]s, [[map]]s as well as [[realia (library science)|realia]] such as [[museum]] objects.

== History ==

The UDC was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] bibliographers [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] at the end of the 19th century. In 1895, they created the Universal Bibliographic Repertory (''Répertoire Bibliographique Universel'') (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive classified index to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist [[Herbert Haviland Field]], who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. Boyd: From the index card to the World City: knowledge organization and visualization in the work and ideas of Paul Otlet. IN: A. Slavic, A. Akdag Salah and S. Davies (Eds.): Proceedings of the International UDC Seminar 2013: Classification &amp; Visualization: Interfaces to Knowledge, The Hague (Netherlands), 24–25 October 2013. Wurzburg: Ergon Verlag, 2013, pp. 1-41&lt;/ref&gt; A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely enumerative classification (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French "Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel" (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special auxiliary tables with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.

The Universal Bibliographic Repertory itself has developed into a remarkable information resource. In the period before World War I it grew to more than 11 million records. The catalogue and its content organized by UDC can still be seen in [[Mundaneum]] in Mons, Belgium (in 2013 recommended for inclusion in the UNESCO [[Memory of the World Register]]&lt;ref name="UNESCO Memory of the World Register"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-9/universal-bibliographic-repertory/ UNESCO Memory of the World Register], "Universal Bibliographic Repertory - UNESCO Memory of the World Register"&lt;/ref&gt;).

== The application of UDC ==

UDC is used in around 150,000 libraries in 130 countries and in many bibliographical services which require detailed content indexing. In a number of countries it is the main classification system for information exchange and is used in all types of libraries: public, school, academic and special libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=Use of the Universal Decimal Classification: a worldwide survey |journal=Journal of Documentation |date=2006 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=211–228 |ref=harv |language=en|hdl=10150/105579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UDC Users Worldwide"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=users_worldwide  UDC Users Worldwide], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UDC Countries"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/countries.htm UDC Countries], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;

UDC is also used in national bibliographies of around 30 countries. Examples of large databases indexed by UDC include:&lt;ref name="Large collections"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=collections Collections indexed by UDC], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;

UDC has traditionally been used for the indexing of scientific articles which was an important source of information of scientific output in the period predating electronic publishing. Collections of research articles in many countries covering decades of scientific output contain UDC codes.  Examples of journal articles indexed by UDC:
:UDC code '''663.12:57.06''' in the article "Yeast Systematics: from Phenotype to Genotype" in the  journal ''Food Technology and Biotechnology'' ({{ISSN|1330-9862}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yeast Systematics: from Phenotype to Genotype |journal=Food Technology and Biotechnology |url=http://www.ftb.pbf.hr/index.php/ftb/article/viewFile/243/241 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |ref=harv |issn=1330-9862|quote=Example: Journal article indexed by UDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UDC structure ==

=== Notation ===
A notation is a code commonly used in classification schemes to represent a class, i.e. a subject and its position in the hierarchy, to enable mechanical sorting and filing of subjects. UDC uses [[Arabic numerals]] arranged decimally. Every number is thought of as a decimal fraction with the initial decimal point omitted, which determines the filing order. An advantage of decimal notational systems is that they are infinitely extensible, and when new subdivisions are introduced, they need not disturb the existing allocation of numbers. For ease of reading, a UDC notation is usually punctuated after every third digit:
{| 
|- 
| style="width:18%; font-weight:bold;" | Notation || style="font-weight:bold;" | Caption (Class description)
|-
| 539.120 ||Theoretical problems of elementary particles physics. Theories and models of fundamental interactions
|-
| 539.120.2 || Symmetries of quantum physics
|-
|539.120.22 ||  Conservation laws
|-
| 539.120.222 ||   Translations. Rotations
|-
| 539.120.224 ||   Reflection in time and space
|-
|539.120.226 ||   Space-time symmetries
|-
| 539.120.23 ||  Internal symmetries
|-
| 539.120.3 || Currents
|-
| 539.120.4 || Unified field theories
|-
|539.120.5 || Strings
|}

In UDC the notation has two features that make the scheme easier to browse and work with: 
* '''hierarchically expressive''' – the longer the notation, the more specific the class: removing the final digit automatically produces a broader class code.
* '''syntactically expressive''' – when UDC codes are combined, the sequence of digits is interrupted by a precise type of punctuation sign which indicates that the expression is a combination of classes rather than a simple class e.g. the colon in 34:32 indicates that there are two distinct notational elements: 34 Law. Jurisprudence and 32 Politics; the closing and opening parentheses and double quotes in the following code 913(574.22)"19"(084.3) indicate four separate notational elements: 913 Regional geography, (574.22) North Kazakhstan (Soltüstik Qazaqstan); "19" 20th century and (084.3) Maps (document form)

=== Basic features and syntax ===
UDC is an analytico-synthetic and [[faceted classification]]. It allows an unlimited combination of attributes of a subject and relationships between subjects to be expressed. UDC codes from different tables can be combined to present various aspects of document content and form, e.g. 94(410)"19"(075) History ''(main subject)'' of United Kingdom ''(place)'' in 20th century ''(time)'', a textbook ''(document form)''. Or: 37:2 Relationship between Education and Religion. Complex UDC expressions can be accurately parsed into constituent elements.

UDC is also a disciplinary classification covering the entire universe of knowledge.&lt;ref name="UDC Subject Coverage"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=subject_coverage UDC Subject Coverage], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt; This type of classification can also be described as ''aspect'' or ''perspective'', which means that concepts are subsumed and placed under the field in which they are studied. Thus, the same concept can appear in different fields of knowledge. This particular feature is usually implemented in UDC by re-using the same concept in various combinations with the main subject, e.g. a code for language in common auxiliaries of language is used to derive numbers for ethnic grouping, individual languages in linguistics and individual literatures. Or, a code from the auxiliaries of place, e.g. ''(410) United Kingdom'', uniquely representing the concept of United Kingdom can be used to express ''911(410) Regional geography of United Kingdom'' and ''94(410) History of United Kingdom''.

=== Organization of classes ===

Concepts are organized in two kinds of tables in UDC:&lt;ref name="UDC Structure"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=about_structure UDC Structure and Tables], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Common auxiliary tables''' (including certain auxiliary signs). These tables contain facets of concepts representing, general recurrent characteristics, applicable over a range of subjects throughout the main tables, including notions such as place, language of the text and physical form of the document, which may occur in almost any subject. UDC numbers from these tables, called common auxiliaries are simply added at the end of the number for the subject taken from the main tables. There are over 15,000 of common auxiliaries in UDC.
*'''The main tables or main schedules''' containing the various disciplines and branches of knowledge, arranged in 9 main classes,  numbered from 0 to 9 (with class 4 being vacant). At the beginning of each class there are also series of special auxiliaries, which express aspects that are recurrent within this specific class. Main tables in UDC contain more than 60,000 subdivisions.

==== Main classes ====
*0 [[Science]] and [[Knowledge]]. [[Organization]]. [[Computer Science]]. [[Information Science]]. [[Documentation]]. [[Librarianship]]. [[Institutions]]. [[Publications]]
*1 [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]]. [[Outline of psychology|Psychology]]
*2 [[Outline of religion|Religion]]. [[Outline of theology|Theology]]
*3 [[Outline of social science|Social Sciences]]
*4 ''vacant''
*5 [[Outline of mathematics|Mathematics]]. [[Outline of natural science|Natural Sciences]]
*6 [[Outline of applied science|Applied Sciences]]. [[Outline of medicine|Medicine]], [[Outline of technology|Technology]]
*7 [[The arts|The Arts]]. [[Outline of entertainment|Entertainment]]. [[Outline of sports|Sport]]
*8 [[Outline of linguistics|Linguistics]]. [[Outline of literature|Literature]]
*9 [[Outline of geography|Geography]]. [[Outline of history|History]]

The vacant class 4 is the result of a planned schedule expansion. This class was freed by moving linguistics into class 8 in the 1960s to make space for future developments in the rapidly expanding fields of knowledge; primarily natural sciences and technology.

==== Common auxiliary tables ====
''Common auxiliaries'' are aspect-free concepts that can be used in combination with any other UDC code from the main classes or with other common auxiliaries. They have unique notational representations that makes them stand out in complex expressions. Common auxiliary numbers always begin with a certain symbol known as a facet indicator, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; (equal sign) always introduces concepts representing the language of a document; (0...) numbers enclosed in parentheses starting with zero always represent a concept designating document form. Thus (075) Textbook and =111 English can be combined to express, e.g.(075)=111 Textbooks in English, and when combined with numbers from the main UDC tables they can be used as follows: 2(075)=111 Religion textbooks in English, 51(075)=111 Mathematics textbooks in English etc.

*=...	Common auxiliaries of language. Table 1c
*(0...)	Common auxiliaries of form. Table 1d
*(1/9)	Common auxiliaries of place. Table 1e
*(=...)	Common auxiliaries of human ancestry, ethnic grouping and nationality. Table 1f
*"..."	Common auxiliaries of time. Table 1g helps to make minute division of time e.g.:  "1993-1996''
*-0...	Common auxiliaries of general characteristics: Properties, Materials, Relations/Processes and Persons. Table 1k.
*-02	Common auxiliaries of properties. Table 1k
*-03	Common auxiliaries of materials. Table 1k
*-04	Common auxiliaries of relations, processes and operations. Table 1k
*-05	Common auxiliaries of persons and personal characteristics. Table 1k this table is repeated

==== Connecting signs ====
In order to preserve the precise meaning and enable accurate parsing of complex UDC expressions, a number of connecting symbols are made available to relate and extend UDC numbers. These are:
{| class="wikitable"
!Symbol !! Symbol name !! Meaning !! Example
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Plus and minus signs|plus]] || coordination, addition || e.g. 59+636 [[zoology]] and [[animal breeding]]
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Slash (punctuation)|stroke]] || consecutive extension || e.g. 592/599 Systematic zoology (everything from 592 to 599 inclusive)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] || relation || e.g. 17:7  Relation of [[ethics]] to [[art]]
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;[ ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; || square [[bracket]]s || subgrouping || e.g. 311:[622+669](485) [[statistics]] of [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] in [[Sweden]] (the auxiliary qualifiers 622+669 considered as a unit)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; || asterisk || Introduces non-UDC notation  || e.g. 523.4*433 Planetology, minor planet Eros ([[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] authorized number after the asterisk)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;A/Z&lt;/nowiki&gt; || alphabetical extension || Direct alphabetical specification  || e.g. 821.133.1MOL French literature, works of Molière

&lt;small&gt;The UDC tables for religion are fully faceted. Indicated in italics below, are special auxiliary numbers that can be used to express attributes (facets) of any specific faith. Any special number can be combined with any religion e.g.  ''-5 Worship'' can be used to express e.g. ''26-5 Worship in Judaism'', ''27-5 Worship in Christianity'', ''24-5 Worship in Buddhism''. The complete special auxiliary tables contain around 2000 subdivisions of various attributes that can be attached to express various aspects of individual faiths to a great level of specificity allowing equal level of detail for every religion.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Class 6 occupies the largest proportion of UDC schedules. It contains over 44,000 subdivisions. Each specific field of technology or industry usually contains more than one special auxiliary table with concepts needed to express operations, processes, materials and products. As a result, UDC codes are often created through the combination of various attributes. Equally, some parts of this class enumerate concepts to a great level of detail e.g.  ''621.882.212 Hexagon screws with additional shapes. Including: Flank screws. Collar screws. Cap screws''

====8 Language. [[Outline of linguistics|Linguistics]]. [[Outline of literature|Literature]]====

&lt;small&gt;Tables for class 8 are fully faceted and details are expressed through combination with common auxiliaries of language (Table 1c) and a series of special auxiliary tables to indicate other facets or attributes in Linguistics or Literature. As a result, this class allows for great specificity in indexing although the schedules themselves occupy very little space in UDC. The subdivisions of e.g. ''811 Languages'' or ''821 Literature'' are derived from common auxiliaries of language =1/=9 (Table 1c) by substituting a point for the equals sign, e.g. 811.111 English language (as a subject of a linguistic study) and ''821.111 English literature'' derives from ''=111 English language''. Common auxiliaries of place and time are also frequently used in this class to express place and time facets of Linguistics or Literature, e.g. ''821.111(71)"18" English literature of Canada in 19th century''
&lt;/small&gt;
  80	General questions relating to both linguistics and literature. Philology

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">In [[mathematics]], the '''Veronese surface''' is an [[algebraic surface]] in five-dimensional [[projective space]], and is realized by the '''Veronese embedding''', the embedding of the [[projective plane]] given by the complete [[linear system of conics]]. It is named after [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1854–1917). Its generalization to higher dimension is known as the '''Veronese variety'''.

The surface admits an embedding in the four-dimensional projective space defined by the projection from a general point in the five-dimensional space. Its general projection to three-dimensional projective space is called a [[Steiner surface]].

==Definition==
The Veronese surface is the image of the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\nu:\mathbb{P}^2\to \mathbb{P}^5&lt;/math&gt;
given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nu: [x:y:z] \mapsto [x^2:y^2:z^2:yz:xz:xy]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[x:\cdots]&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[homogeneous coordinates]]. The map &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''Veronese embedding.'''

==Motivation==
The Veronese surface arises naturally in the study of [[conic]]s. A conic is a degree 2 plane curve, thus defined by an equation:
:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dxz + Eyz + Fz^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The pairing between coefficients &lt;math&gt;(A, B, C, D, E, F)&lt;/math&gt; and variables &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in coefficients and quadratic in the variables; the Veronese map makes it linear in the coefficients and linear in the monomials. Thus for a fixed point &lt;math&gt;[x:y:z],&lt;/math&gt; the condition that a conic contains the point is a [[linear equation]] in the coefficients, which formalizes the statement that "passing through a point imposes a linear condition on conics".

==Veronese map== 
The '''Veronese map''' or '''Veronese variety''' generalizes this idea to mappings of general degree ''d'' in ''n''+1 variables. That is, the Veronese map of degree ''d'' is the map

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_d\colon \mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^m&lt;/math&gt;

with ''m'' given by the [[multiset coefficient]], or more familiarly the [[binomial coefficient]], as:

:&lt;math&gt;m= \left(\!\!{n + 1 \choose d}\!\!\right) - 1 = {n+d \choose d} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The map sends &lt;math&gt;[x_0:\ldots:x_n]&lt;/math&gt; to all possible [[monomial]]s of total degree ''d'', thus the appearance of combinatorial functions; the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; are due to projectivization. The last expression shows that for fixed source dimension ''n,'' the target dimension is a polynomial in ''d'' of degree ''n'' and leading coefficient &lt;math&gt;1/n!.&lt;/math&gt;

For low degree, &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt; is the trivial constant map to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^0,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^n,&lt;/math&gt; so ''d'' is generally taken to be 2 or more.

One may define the Veronese map in a coordinate-free way, as

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_d: \mathbb{P}V \to \mathbb{P}(\rm{Sym}^d V)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is any [[vector space]] of finite dimension, and &lt;math&gt;\rm{Sym}^d V&lt;/math&gt; are its [[symmetric power]]s of degree ''d''.  This is homogeneous of degree ''d'' under scalar multiplication on ''V'', and therefore passes to a mapping on the underlying [[projective space]]s.

If the vector space ''V'' is defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' which does not have [[characteristic zero]], then the definition must be altered to be understood as a mapping to the dual space of polynomials on ''V''.  This is because for fields with finite characteristic ''p'', the ''p''th powers of elements of ''V'' are not [[rational normal curve]]s, but are of course a line. (See, for example [[additive polynomial]] for a treatment of polynomials over a field of finite characteristic).

=== Rational normal curve ===
{{see|Rational normal curve}}

For &lt;math&gt;n=1,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is known as the [[rational normal curve]], of which the lower-degree examples are familiar.
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=1&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese map is simply the identity map on the projective line.
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=2,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is the standard [[parabola]] &lt;math&gt;[x^2:xy:y^2],&lt;/math&gt; in affine coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,x^2).&lt;/math&gt;
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=3,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is the [[twisted cubic]], &lt;math&gt;[x^3:x^2y:xy^2:y^3],&lt;/math&gt; in affine coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,x^2,x^3).&lt;/math&gt;

==Biregular==
The image of a variety under the Veronese map is again a variety, rather than simply a [[Constructible set (topology)|constructible set]]; furthermore, these are isomorphic in the sense that the inverse map exists and is [[regular function|regular]] – the Veronese map is [[biregular]]. More precisely, the images of [[open set]]s in the [[Zariski topology]] are again open.

'''Vyūha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: व्यूह) means - 'to arrange troops in a battle array (formation)', 'to arrange, put or place in order, to dispose, separate, divide, alter, transpose, disarrange, resolve (vowels syllables etc.)'. Its root is व्यः which means - a 'cover' or 'veil'. This word also refers to emanation and to the manifest power of Lord [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|pages=157, 1522|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.5:192.apte }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has different meanings depending on the doctrine of the treatise and the context, such as revealing of the knowledge of Vedas, manifestation of Vishnu or Buddha, and the war formations of Mahabharata.

==Concept of Vyuh in Upanishads: Unraveling of the Knowledge==
In the [[Upanishads]] the word ''vyuha'' occurs once, it appears in śloka 16 of the [[Isha Upanishad]] :-

:पूषन्नेकर्षे यम सूर्य प्राजापत्य व्यूह रश्मिन्समूह |
:तेजो यत्ते रूपं कल्याणतमं तत्ते पश्यामि योऽसावसौ पुरुषः सोऽहमस्मि ||

:"O Sun, sole traveler of the Heavens, controller of all, [[Surya]], son of [[Prajapati]]; remove thy rays and gather up the burning light. I behold thy glorious form; I am he, the [[Purusha]] within thee."

In this passage ''vyūha'' means – 'remove' (to a distance thy rays).

==Concept of Vayuh in Pancaratra: The Vaishnav doctrine of manifestation==
The [[Pancaratra|Pāñcarātra Āgama]], which are based on ''Ekāyana'' recension of the [[Yajurveda|Śukla Yajurveda]], is later than the [[Vedas]] but earlier than the [[Mahabharata]], the main ''[[Agama (Hinduism)|āgamas]]'' are- the ''[[Vaishnavism|Vaiśnava]]'' (worship of [[Vishnu]]), the ''[[Shaivism|Śaiva]]'' (worship of [[Shiva]]) and the ''[[Shaktism|Śākta]]'' (worship of [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]]) ''āgamas''; all ''āgamas'' are elaborate systems of [[Vedic]] knowledge. According to [[Vedanta Desika]], the ''Pāñcarātra āgama'' teaches the five-fold daily religious duty consisting of – ''abhigamana'', ''[[upādāna]]'', ''ijyā'', ''[[svādhyāya]]'' and ''[[yoga]]'', the name of this ''āgama'' is derived on account of its description of the five-fold manifestation of the Supreme Being viz, ''para'' (supreme or the transcendental form), ''vyūha'' (formation or manifestation as the four ''vyūha''), ''vibhava'' (reincarnation or descent to earth as avtāra), ''arcā'' (the visible image of God) and ''antaryāmi'' (the cosmic form of God as existing everywhere and in everything).  [[Lakshmi]] accompanies Vishnu in His ''vyūha'' manifestation which is four-fold (''Chatur-vyūha'') – [[Vāsudeva]] (as the creator), [[Balarama|Samkarśana]] (as the sustainer), [[Pradyumna]] (as destroyer - dissolution of the universe) and [[Aniruddha]] (as promulgator of spiritual knowledge). This is the ''Vaiśnava'' doctrine of ''Vyūha'' or ''the doctrine of formation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaisnavism: Its Philosophy, Theology and Religious Discipline|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=15,163,213|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=evmiLInyxBMC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L1GeVImCJcSPuASC6YLwCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chatur-vyūha forms of Vishnu are related to four of the six causes of creation which six are God Himself as the final cause of creation and His five aspects – Narāyana ('thinking'), Vāsudeva ('feeling'), Samkarśana ('willing'), Pradyumna ('knowing') and Aniruddha ('acting') successively; each divinity controls its specific creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Creationism|author=Ashish Dalela|publisher=iUniverse|page=327|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qLe-aZfl7YEC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six gunas – '' [[jnana]] '' (omniscience), '' [[aishvarya]] '' (lordship), '' [[shakti]] '' (potency), '' [[Five Strengths|bala]] '' (force), '' [[Vīrya (Hinduism)|virya]] '' (virtue) and ''tejas'' (self-sufficiency), acting in pairs and in totality, are the instruments and the subtle material of pure creation.

==Concept of Vyuha in Buddhism: The manifestation of a Buddha==
One of the five Dhyāni Buddhas, Amitābha, who does not appear in any [[Pali]] Buddhist text or in [[Sanskrit]] Buddhist text, and his active manifestation in Bodhisttava form, Avalokiteśvara, are known through the two-versioned [[Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhist]] sūtra [[Infinite Life Sutra|Sukhāvatī-vyūha]] ('Array of the Land of Bliss') which text pertains to [[Gautama Buddha]]’s recollection of one of his previous births as Amitābha, as told to [[Ānanda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.2|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=383|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=antaryami+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U4WeVIbILdWfugSFpoHoCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also told about 81 Buddhas of the past, the last named being Lokeśvararāja who taught Dharmākara who having practiced the virtues of a Bodhisttava and attained enlightenment was reborn as Amitābha whose land this text describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Literature|author=Moriz Winternitz|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=298|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=vyuha+++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ZGfVIfqEIqyuATRqYD4AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha%20%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna Buddhism, the word ''vyūha'' means – 'arrangement', the like of marvellous, supernatural, magical arrangements, or supernatural manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visions of Sukhavati|author=Julian F.Pas|publisher=SUNY Press|page=369|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Wjv85t5E0hQC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of Vyuha in Mahabharata: The war formations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14843">The '''writing process''' is the series of actions required to produce a coherent written text. It is a key term in the teaching of writing.

== Overview ==
In 1972, Donald M. Murray published a brief manifesto titled "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product",&lt;ref&gt;Donald M. Murray, "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product" ''The Leaflet'' (November 1972), rpt. in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory'', 2nd ed., ed. Victor Villanueva, Urbana: NCTE, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase which became a rallying cry for many writing teachers. Ten years later, in 1982, Maxine Hairston argued that the teaching of writing had undergone a "paradigm shift" in moving from a focus on written products to writing processes.&lt;ref&gt;Maxine Hairston, "The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing" ''CCC'' 33 (1982), pp. 76-88, rpt. in ''The Norton Book of Composition Studies'', ed. Susan Miller, New York: Norton, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, it was assumed that the writing process generally operated in some variation of three to five "stages"; the configuration below is typical:

* [[Prewriting]]
* [[Draft document|Drafting]]
* [[Revision (writing)|Revising]]
* [[Proofreading]]
* [[Publishing]]

What is now called "post-process" research demonstrates that it is seldom accurate to describe these "stages" as fixed steps in a straightforward process. Rather, they are more accurately conceptualized as overlapping parts of a complex whole or parts of a recursive process that are repeated multiple times throughout the writing process. Thus writers routinely discover that, for instance, editorial changes trigger brainstorming and a change of purpose; that drafting is temporarily interrupted to correct a misspelling; or that the boundary between prewriting and drafting is less than obvious.

== Approaches to the process ==

=== Cognitive process theory of writing (Flower–Hayes model) ===
{{see also|Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition}}
==== Overview of cognitive model ====
Flower and Hayes extend Bitzer's rhetorical situation to become a series of rhetorical problems, i.e., when a writer must represent the situation as a problem to be solved, such as the invocation of a particular audience to an oversimplified approach such as finding a theme and completing the writing in two pages by Monday's class.{{sfn|Flower|Hayes|1980|pp=26–27}}

In "The Cognition of Discovery" Flower and Hayes set out to discover the differences between good and bad writers. They came to three results from their study, which suggests that good writers envelop the three following characteristics when solving their rhetorical problems:

# Good writers respond to all of the rhetorical problems
# Good writers build their problem representation by creating a particularly rich network of goals for affecting a reader; and
# Good writers represent the problem not only in more breadth, but in depth.{{sfn |Flower|Hayes|1980|p=30}}

Flower and Hayes suggest that composition instructors need to consider showing students how "to explore and define their own problems, even within the constraints of an assignment".{{sfn |Flower|Hayes|1980|p=30}} They believe that "Writers discover what they want to do by insistently, energetically exploring the entire problem before them and building for themselves a unique image of the problem they want to solve."

==== Criticism of cognitive model ====
[[Patricia Bizzell]] argues that even though educators may have an understanding of "how" the writing process occurs, educators shouldn't assume that this knowledge can answer the question "about 'why' the writer makes certain choices in certain situations", since writing is always situated within a discourse community (484{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}). She discusses how the Flower and Hayes model relies on what is called the process of "translating ideas into visible language" (486{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}). This process occurs when students "treat written English as a set of containers into which we pour meaning" (486{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}). Bizzell contends that this process "remains the emptiest box" in the cognitive process model, since it de-contextualizes the original context of the written text, negating the original. She argues that "Writing does not so much contribute to thinking as provide an occasion for thinking..."

=== Social model of writing process ===
"The aim of collaborative learning helps students to find more control in their learning situation. {{sfn|Trimbur|2009|p=}} 

Even grammar has a social turn in writing: "It may be that to fully account for the contempt that some errors of usage arouse, we will have to understand better than we do the relationship between language, order, and those deep psychic forces that perceived linguistic violations seem to arouse in otherwise amiable people".{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=415}} 
So one can't simply say a thing is right or wrong. There is a difference of degrees attributed by social forces.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=}}

=== Expressivist process theory of writing ===

According to the expressivist theory, the process of writing is centered on the writer's transformation. This involves the writer changing in the sense that voice and identity are established and the writer has a sense of his or her self. This theory became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Richard Fulkerson's article "Four Philosophies of Composition", the focus of expressivism is for writers to have "... an interesting, credible, honest, and personal voice". Moreover, proponents of the expressivist process view this theory as a way for students to become fulfilled and healthy both emotionally and mentally. Those who teach this process often focus on journaling and other classroom activities to focus on student self-discovery and at times, low-stakes writing. Prominent figures in the field include John Dixon, Ken Macrorie, Lou Kelly, Donald C. Stewart and [[Peter Elbow]].

=== Historical approaches to composition and process ===

An historical response to process is concerned primarily with the manner in which writing has been shaped and governed by historical and social forces. These forces are dynamic and contextual, and therefore render any static iteration of process unlikely.

Notable scholars that have conducted this type of inquiry include media theorists such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Walter Ong]], [[Gregory Ulmer]], and Cynthia Selfe. Much of McLuhan's work, for example, centered around the impact of written language on oral cultures, degrees to which various media are accessible and interactive, and the ways in which electronic media determine communication patterns. His evaluation of technology as a shaper of human societies and psyches indicates a strong connection between historical forces and literacy practices.

=== Autistic autobiographies ===

As appealing as document sharing may be for students with [[autism]] in particular,&lt;ref name="Rose, Irene 2008"&gt;Rose, Irene. "Autistic Autobiography or Autistic Life Journal." Journal of Literary Disability 2.1 (2008): 44-54&lt;/ref&gt; being able to contextualize one's life story in the context of their disability may prove the most powerful expression of the writing process overall. Rose illustrates &lt;ref name="Rose, Irene 2008"/&gt; that creating narrative identity in a conventional sense is quite difficult for autistic students because of their challenges with interpersonal communication. The narratives of autistic students can sometimes be troubling to neurotypical peers with whom they share their work, as Rose notes in quoting autistic autobiographer Dawn Price-Hughes, "Sometimes reaching out and communicating isn’t easy–it can bring sadness and regret. Some of my family and friends, after reading the manuscript for this book, were deeply saddened to learn how I experienced my world."

Rose points to the well-known work of [[Temple Grandin]] and [[Donna Williams]] as examples of autistic autobiographies and analogizes toward the usefulness of women's autobiographies championed by Susan Stanford Friedman to show women's inter-connectivity, suggesting the same can be learned through autistic autobiographies. She writes that such works can minimize the "pathologisation of difference" which can easily occur between autistic students and neuroytpical peers can be broken down by such autobiographies. As Rose directly says, "I argue here that awareness of the relationality of autistic life writing, and the recognition of its corollary status as testimonio and attention to the material relations of the production of these texts is particularly useful in assessing their social significance."

From a [[rhetoric]]al perspective the use for students with disabilities (not just autistic students) seems to be promising. It would appear to foster a sense of a community among students with disabilities and helping these voices be brought in from the margins similarly to the way [[Mike Rose (educator)|Mike Rose]] refers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their needs in ''[[Lives on the Boundary]]''.

== Editing ==
{{Main|Editing}}
Editing operates on several levels. The lowest level, often called line editing, is the stage in the writing process where the writer makes changes in the text to correct errors—such as spelling, subject/verb agreement, verb tense consistency, point of view consistency, mechanical errors, word choice, and word usage (there, their or they're)&lt;ref name=Hacker /&gt;—and fine-tune his or her style. Having revised the draft for content, the writer's task is now to make changes that will improve the communication with the reader. Depending on the genre, the writer may choose to adhere to the conventions of [[Standard English]]. These conventions are still being developed and the rulings on controversial issues may vary depending on the source. For example, [[William Strunk Jr.|Strunk]] and [[E. B. White|White]]'s ''[[Elements of Style]]'', first published in 1918, is considered by some{{By whom|date=September 2018}} to be an authority on stylistic conventions, but has been derided by linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] as "stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |authorlink=Geoffrey K.
