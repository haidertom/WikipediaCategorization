      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">'''Adam Soliman''' is the director of The [[Fisheries Law Centre]]. He is a researcher focused on legal and economic issues in [[Fisheries]].  He teaches fisheries law in several countries and advocates for further access to justice in small-scale fisheries. He researches and conducts analysis to issues in [[fisheries management]] with special focus on small-scale fisheries. He specializes in fisheries management scheme and [[property rights]] particularly in [[catch share]]s and other management schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Soliman, Adam. New Not-For-Profit Research Center: The Fisheries Law Centre. Ag Law News. Retrieved 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career in the agribusiness sector, working for a family operation in the Middle East. He holds a BSc and MSc. in Agricultural Economics. He also had Juris Doctorate from the University of Hong Kong and a LLM  in Agriculture and Food Law from the University of Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadett, Lauren. The LLM. Program in Agricultural and Food Law. Retrieved 10 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Soliman asserts the importance of including fisheries law in law school curriculums. He describes the access to justice gap in fisheries and coastal communities as three intertwined issues: lack of education; lack of legal research and lack of advocacy.

'''Ally &amp; Gargano''' (A &amp; G) was an [[United States|American]] [[advertising agency]], which ''[[Advertising Age]]'' named Agency of the Year in 1982. It was the first advertising agency used by [[Federal Express]], beginning their work with the company in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonough|first1=John|last2=Egolf|first2=Karen|title=The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising|date=2015|isbn=9781135949068|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZLtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA572&amp;dq=%22Ally+%26+Gargano%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDtaSHzf_VAhUMNSYKHezFCqkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ally%20%26%20Gargano%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Carl Ally]] left Papert, Koenig, Lois in 1962 to open his own agency. Founded as Carl Ally, Inc. in 1963, Ally elevated partner [[Amil Gargano]] and renamed the firm Ally &amp; Gargano in 1976. Ally sold his voting stock in the agency to Gargano in 1979, remaining chairman. That year Edward M. Gallagher joined A&amp;G as chief operating officer, and quickly brought in the [[MCI Communications|MCI]] account.

The company went public in 1983, but a string of client losses and budget cutbacks increased internal tensions. Ally formally retired from Ally &amp; Gargano on January 1, 1985, and in June 1986, [[Marketing Corporation of America]] (MCA) bought Ally &amp; Gargano for $26.6 million. After further account losses, including the showcase Saab account in December 1988, MCA sold control and 50 percent of the agency to [[Wesray Capital Corporation]] for $30 million.

Carl Ally was inducted into the [[American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame]] in 1991, and Gargano left A&amp;G that year when his contract expired. The agency closed on July 26, 1995.[http://adage.com/article/news/ally-gargano-close-doors/16292/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">'''Antonín Koláček''' (7 August 1959, [[Kroměříž]]{{citation needed|date = September 2015}}) is a former Czech manager and entrepreneur. In 2008 he sold his shares in his companies and became an advocate and practitioner of buddhism.&lt;ref name=e15&gt;[http://euro.e15.cz/profit/uhlobaron-kolacek-vymenil-uhli-za-dusi-897171 Uhlobaron Koláček vyměnil uhlí za duši]&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in the [[voucher privatization]] of [[Czech Coal Group|Mostecká uhelná společnost (now Czech Coal)]]; later he became its CEO.

== Early career ==
After his studies at the [[Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague]], he worked as a personalist for a Prague chocolate factory (1983-1990) and since 1990 for [[Komerční banka]].

In 1994, he founded (together with [[Petr Kraus]]) Newton Financial Management Group, a company that focused on trading on financial markets and related advisory services. In 1995, he became a member of the [[board of directors]] (executive board) of [[Czech Coal Group|Mostecká uhelná společnost]] as the chief personalist of Komerční banka, which hold shares of Mostecká uhelná společnost (MUS).&lt;ref name=lidovky&gt;[http://www.lidovky.cz/kdo-jsou-odsouzeni-manazeri-z-mus-jeden-basketbalista-dalsi-hudebnik-1j3-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A131010_173636_ln_domov_sk Kdo jsou odsouzení manažeři z MUS?

'''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, key performance indicators, business / operational exceptions and business risks, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s.

The term was originally coined by analysts at [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/105500/105562/105562.pdf Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a [[business process]] that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management.

==Goals and benefits==
The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed [[business decision]]s, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.

==Key features==
One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing the [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems.

Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably.

Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the [[issue tracking system]]. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated [[problem solving]], where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes.

==Deployment effort==
In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions.

BAM is now considered{{who|date=January 2016}} a critical component of [[Operational Intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information.

==Processing events==
All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on [[complex event processing]] (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers.

==Examples==
A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.

Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7114">'''Creative Sector Tax Relief''' is a programme of [[tax incentive]]s implemented in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012 which encompass new incentives aimed at supporting the animation, high-end television and video games industries, in addition to the existing relief available for [[film production]]. The new reliefs are designed to promote culturally-relevant productions in the UK, to incentivise [[investment]] into UK productions that would otherwise take place outside the UK, and to support the necessary critical mass of infrastructure and skills in the UK for both today and in the longer term.

==History==
The government announced in the March 2012 Budget that it would introduce corporation tax reliefs from April 2013 for the [[video games industries|video-games]], [[animation]] and high-end television industries, subject to State aid approval and following consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HM Revenue and Customs|title=Budget 2012|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/corp-bus-tax.htm|work=Corporate and Business Taxes|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new reliefs were confirmed in Budget 2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-2013-chancellors-statement "Budget statement 2013"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the draft Finance Bill 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/finance_bill_2013.htm "Finance Bill 2013"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to this point, the creative industries had struggled to access existing [[Technology Tax Relief|technology tax relief]] because the qualifying definitions of schemes such as R&amp;D Tax Relief have fallen outside the creative sectors, even though companies in these sectors are often pioneers in new and advanced technologies.
The reliefs will bring the UK’s creative sector tax regime into line with other countries such as Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1268752355851 "Canadian Film Tax Relief"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan which already have specific tax reliefs for the creative industries.

==Overview==
Production companies in all three industries are able to claim an additional deduction worth 100 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (where qualifying expenditure is a maximum of 80 per cent of total production expenditure) and, if they are loss-making, they will be able to surrender such losses for a payable tax credit worth 25 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (ie. effectively a payable credit of a maximum 20 per cent of total production expenditure).
These reliefs are modelled on the existing film tax relief scheme, which has supported over £5 billion of investment into [[British films]] and seen a 70 per cent increase in the film production workforce since its introduction in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/creative_sector_tax_reliefs_response111212.pdf "Creative Sector Tax Relief Treasury response"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft [[Finance Bill]] 2013 legislation allowed for qualifying expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013 to be eligible for the reliefs subject to State aid approval by the [[European Commission]]. The Commission approved the animation tax relief and high-end television production tax relief to start on 1 April 2013 once the regulations come into force with the Royal Assent of the 2013 Finance Act in August 2013. Video game tax relief was given State aid approval by the EU Commission in March 2014, meaning that it came into effect from 1 April 2014.

The steady state cost, after the initial phasing-in period, of the reliefs is forecast to be approximately £120 million per annum (£55 million for video game tax relief and animation tax relief, plus £65 million for high-end television production tax relief) in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by [[HM Treasury]]. The estimated annual administrative cost for HMRC of running all three new creative industry tax relief regimes will be approximately £500,000). They will also set up a specialist unit to facilitate claims for animation and video game relief (but not high-end tv production).

==Cultural test==
Productions must be certified by the [[Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport]] (DCMS) as culturally British in order to be eligible for relief, as per the existing Film Tax Relief.

The cultural tests for each relief were published in the draft Finance Bill 2013 .

The cultural tests will be handled by the [[British Film Institute]] on behalf of DCMS as follows:
*Animation tax relief - BFI cultural test application form&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/film-industry/british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-animation-programmes "BFI animation cultural test application form"] Retrieved on 01 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*High-end tv production tax relief - BFI cultural test application form&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/film-industry/british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-high-end-television "BFI high end TV cultural test application form"] Retrieved on 01 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other technology tax reliefs==
* Video Games Tax Relief - The Video Games Tax Relief (VGTR) was established in 2014 to help support creativity in the UK games industry. The key benefit of the tax relief is that qualifying companies can claim up to 20% of their “core expenditure” back, provided that expenditure has been made in the European Economic Area (EEA).
* Animation Tax Relief
* High-End TV Production Tax Relief
* [[Research and Development Tax Credit|Research &amp; Development Tax Credit]] 
* [[Research and Development Expenditure Credit|Research &amp; Development Expenditure Credit]] 
* [[Research and Development Capital Allowances|Research &amp; Development Capital Allowances]]
* [[Patent Box]]
* Film Tax Relief

The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and the [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax-relief to individuals who invest in small early-stage [[business]]es.

==Public consultation and working groups==
The government ran a public consultation exercise in summer 2012 on the proposals for Creative Sector Tax Reliefs. Respondents included industry participants ([[The Walt Disney Company]]; [[Channel 4]]; [[Electronic Arts]]; [[Aardman Animations]]) the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]) and independent consultants (MMP Tax); and trade bodies such as [[The Independent Games Developers Association]](TIGA).

The government also established industry-focused working groups for the animation, high-end television and video games industries to complement wider consultation on the new tax reliefs and to discuss options and proposals in more detail.

According to the book's preface, Factory Physics is "a systematic description of the underlying behavior of [[Operations_management#Production_systems|manufacturing systems]].  Understanding it enables managers and engineers to work with the natural tendencies of manufacturing systems to:

# Identify opportunities for improving existing systems.
# Design effective new systems.
# Make the [[trade-off]]s needed to coordinate policies from disparate areas.

The book is used both in industry and in academia for reference and teaching on [[operations management]]. It describes a new approach to manufacturing management based on the laws of Factory Physics science. The fundamental Factory Physics framework states that the essential components of all value streams or production processes or service processes are demand and transformation which are described by structural elements of flows and stocks. There are very specific practical, [[mathematical]] relationships that enable one to describe and control the performance of flows and stocks. The book states that, in the presence of [[Statistical variability|variability]], there are only three buffers available to synchronize [[demand]] and transformation with lowest [[cost]] and highest [[service level]]:

*[[Capacity utilization|capacity]]
*[[inventory]]
*response time.

The book states that its approach enables practical, predictive understanding of flows and stocks and how to best use the three levers to optimally synchronize demand and transformation.

This work won the 1996 [[Institute of Industrial Engineers]] IIE/Joint Publishers Book of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iienet2.org/awards.aspx?id=10802&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">'''Fernão Gomes''' (15th century) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] merchant and explorer from [[Lisbon]], the son of Tristão Gomes de Brito (?).

In 1469, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] granted him the [[monopoly]] of trade in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Besides the payment of an annual rent of 200,000 [[Portuguese real|''reais'']], Gomes was to explore 100 [[league (unit)|league]]s of the coast of [[Africa]] per year, for five years (later the agreement would be extended for another year).&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; He also received a monopoly of trade in [[Aframomum melegueta|guinea pepper]] for another yearly payment of 100,000 ''reais''.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thornr.demon.co.uk/kchrist/discpde.html| title = Descobrimentos após o Príncipe Henrique | accessdate = 2006-12-24| last = Thorn| first = Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Then called "[[Malagueta pepper|malagueta]]", it was a popular substitute for [[black pepper]].)

Gomes employed explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], [[Lopo Gonçalves]], [[Fernão do Pó]] and [[Pedro de Sintra]], He exceeded the requirements of his grant: his expeditions reached the Cape of Santa Catarina, already in the Southern Hemisphere, and also the islands of the Gulf of Guinea.

In 1471 they reached [[Elmina]] (meaning "the Mine"),&lt;ref name="marinha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinha.pt/extra/revista/ra_fev1999/pag21.html |title=O Contrato de Fernão Gomes |accessdate=2006-12-24 |last=Semedo |first=J, de Matos |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020748/http://www.marinha.pt/extra/revista/ra_fev1999/pag21.html |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they found a thriving [[alluvial]] [[gold]] trade. With the substantial revenues he got, especially the trade of his warehouse in Mina, he became known as "'''Fernão Gomes da Mina'''" in 1474.&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor.

With his profits from African trade, Fernão Gomes assisted the Portuguese king in the conquests of [[Conquest of Asilah|Asilah]], [[Alcácer Ceguer]], and [[Tangier]] in Morocco, where he was knighted. Later, in 1478, gathering honors and with an enormous influence on the economy of the kingdom, he was appointed to the royal council.

Given the large profits, in 1482 new King [[John II of Portugal]] ordered a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] to be built in Elmina, to manage the local gold industry: [[Elmina Castle]].&lt;ref name="ghana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116# |title=Elmina Castle |accessdate=2006-12-24 |publisher=Government of Ghana |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009012322/http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116 |archivedate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes married Catarina Leme, an illegitimate child of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]]-Portuguese merchant Martim Leme. Martin Leme was the son of Martin Lems and his noble Portuguese wife Joana Barroso.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz Gonzaga da Silva Leme, ''Genealogia Paulistana'', Volume II, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children. Catarina Leme married João Rodrigues Pais.

The company was founded by [[Torgeir Stensrud]] and [[Trond Kristoffersen]], who were in 2005 convicted on charges of [[fraud]] to 7 and 9 years in prison, respectively. Stensrud and Kristoffersen were also both fined about 100 million €.

==Trond Kristoffersen==
''Trond Kristoffersen'' (13 August 1956 – August 2013) was co-founder of the Finance Credit, Norwegian businessman and convicted [[fraudster]].

He was born in [[Hammerfest]]. In 2003, he was convicted of [[fraud]] and sentenced to 9 years in [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article893637.ece Ex-financier hit with record-long jail term - Aftenposten.no&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208113547/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article893637.ece |date=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also fined 1,2 billion [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] (ca. €100 million), and subsequently went personally bankrupt. He was also barred from engaging in any independent form of trade, as well as from holding senior or board positions in any companies, for life.  

He was incarcerated in [[Ullersmo prison]] from 2007, after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, and was serving the rest of his 9-year [[prison]] sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkiv.na24.no/Nyhet/223570/-+Stensrud+gjemte+50+millioner.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six years in jail he was released after lodging an appeal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4158">A '''fixed-price contract''' is a type of [[contract]] where the payment amount does not depend on resources used or time expended. This is opposed to a [[cost-plus contract]], which is intended to cover the costs with additional [[profit (accounting)|profit]] made. Such a scheme is often used by [[military]] and [[government]] contractors to put the risk on the side of the vendor, and control costs. However, historically when such contracts are used for innovative new projects with untested or undeveloped technologies, such as new military transports or stealth attack planes, it can and often results in a failure if costs greatly exceed the ability of the contractor to absorb unforeseen [[cost overrun]]s.    
   
Fixed prices can require more time, in advance, for sellers to determine the price of each item. However, the fixed-price items can each be purchased faster, but bargaining could set the price for an entire set of items being purchased, reducing the time for such bulk purchases treated as a whole batch. Also, fixed-price items can help in pre-determining the value of the entire inventory, such as for insurance estimates.

However, such contracts continue to be popular despite a history of failed or troubled projects, though they tend to work when costs are well known in advance. Some laws have been written which prefer fixed-price contracts, however, many maintain that such contracts are actually the most expensive, especially when the risks or costs are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/Articles/2009/02/17/Stimulus-bill-requires-fixed-price-contracts.aspx] Fixed-price contracts required by stimulus law By Matthew Weigelt Feb 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===A400M===

[[Airbus]]'s German chief executive [[Tom Enders]] has noted the fixed-price contract for the [[A400M]] transport aircraft was a disaster rooted in [[naivety]], excessive enthusiasm and arrogance, stating, "If you had offered it to an American defence contractor like [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], they would have run a mile from it". He stated that unless the contract was renegotiated, the project must be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13447375] Heavy going   
- 8 April 2009, ''The Economist'', "The future of Europe's high-tech military transport hangs in the balance".&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-12 Avenger II===

The U.S. [[A-12 Avenger II]] development contract was a '''fixed-price incentive contract''', not a fixed price contract,  with a target price of $4.38 billion and ceiling price of $4.84 billion. It was to be a unique, stealthy, [[flying wing]] design. On 7 January 1991, the Secretary of Defense canceled the program. It was the largest contract termination in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] history. Rather than saving costs, the craft was projected to consume up 70 percent of the [[U.S. Navy]]'s aircraft budget within three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/a-12.htm] A-12 Avenger II Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) - 1983-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KC-46 Pegasus ===
The U.S. [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus]] contract is a fixed price contract. Due to its history of cost overruns, it is an example of how fixed price contracts place the risk upon the vendor, in this case [[Boeing]]. Total cost overruns for this aircraft have totaled about $1.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/air-force/2016/07/21/boeing-kc46-cost-overrun-penalty-air-force-boom/87409004/|title = Boeing Racks Up Another $393M In Cost Overruns On KC-46 Program|access-date = 2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boeing was able to absorb those costs and has gained US Air Force approval to put the KC-46 into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article95719762.html|title = Air Force approves first round of KC-46 tanker production|access-date = 2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''general manager''' is an executive who has overall responsibility for managing both the [[revenue]] and [[cost]] elements of a company's [[income statement]], known as profit &amp; loss (P&amp;L) responsibility. A general manager usually oversees most or all of the firm's [[marketing]] and [[sales]] functions as well as the day-to-day [[Business operations|operations]] of the business.  Frequently, the general manager is responsible for effective planning, delegating, coordinating, staffing, organizing, and decision making to attain desirable profit making results for an organization (Sayles 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayles|first=Leonard|title=Leadership|year=1979|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-07-055012-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the general manager of a business is given a different formal title or titles.  Most corporate managers holding the titles of [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[President (corporate title)|president]], for example, are the general managers of their respective businesses.  More rarely, the [[chief financial officer]] (CFO), [[chief operating officer]] (COO), or [[chief marketing officer]] (CMO) will act as the general manager of the business but there is level of post between them therefore GM and CEO are different .  Depending on the company, individuals with the title managing director, regional vice president, country manager, product manager, branch manager, or segment manager may also have general management responsibilities.  In large companies, many vice presidents will have the title of general manager when they have the full set of responsibility for the function in that particular area of the business and are often titled [[vice president]] and general manager.

In technology companies, general managers are often given the title of [[product manager]]. In [[consumer products]] companies, general managers are often given the title [[brand manager]] or category manager.  In [[professional services]] firms, the general manager may hold titles such as managing partner, senior partner, or managing director.

==Industry-specific usages==

===Hotels===
{{Main article|Hotel manager}}
In the hotel industry, the general manager is the head executive responsible for the overall operation of an individual hotel establishment including financial profitability. The general manager holds ultimate managerial authority over the hotel operation and usually reports directly to a regional vice president, corporate office, and/or hotel ownership/investors. Common duties of a general manager include but are not limited to [[Recruitment|hiring]] and [[management]] of an executive team consisting of individual department heads that oversee various hotel departments and functions, [[budgeting]] and [[financial management]], creating and enforcing hotel business objectives and goals, [[sales management]], [[marketing management]], [[revenue management]], [[project management]], [[contract management]], handling of emergencies and other major issues involving guests, employees, or the facility, [[public relations]], [[labor relations]], local government relations, maintaining business partnerships, and many additional duties. The extent of duties of an individual hotel general manager vary significantly depending on the size of the hotel and company organization, for example, general managers of smaller boutique-type hotels may be directly responsible for additional administrative duties such as accounting, human resources, payroll, purchasing, and other duties that would normally be handled by other subordinate managers or entire departments and divisions in a larger hotel operation.

===Sports teams===
{{see also|General manager (American football)|General manager (baseball)|General manager (basketball)|List of National Hockey League general managers|Sports management}}
In most [[professional sports]], the general manager is the team executive responsible for acquiring the rights to player personnel, negotiating their [[contracts]], and reassigning or dismissing players no longer desired on the team.  The general manager may also have responsibility for hiring and firing the head coach of the team.

For many years in U.S. professional sports, [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] often served as general managers for their teams as well, deciding which players would be kept on the team and which ones dismissed, and even negotiating the terms of their contracts in cooperation with the ownership of the team.  In fact, many sports teams in the early years of U.S. professional sports were coached by the owner of the team, so in some cases the same individual served as owner, general manager and head coach.

As the amount of money involved in professional sports increased, many prominent players began to hire [[sports agent|agent]]s to negotiate contracts on their behalf.  This intensified contract negotiations that resulted, as well to ensure all player contracts are in accordance with these caps, as well as consistent with the desires of the ownership and its ability to pay.

General Managers are usually responsible for the selection of players in player [[sports draft|drafts]] and work with the coaching staff and [[scout (sport)|scouts]] to build a strong team.  In sports with developmental or [[minor league]]s, the general manager is usually the team executive with the overall responsibility for "sending down" and "calling up" players to and from these leagues, although the head coach may also have significant input into these decisions.

Some of the most successful sports general managers have been former players and coaches, while others have backgrounds in ownership and business management.

The term is not commonly used in Europe, especially in [[Association football|soccer]], where the position of [[Manager (association football)|manager]] or coach is used instead to refer to the managing/coaching position. The position of [[director of football]] might be the most similar position on many [[UEFA|European football]] clubs.

== History of genetic counseling ==
Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book ''Counseling in Medical Genetics'' in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/sheldon-clark-reed-1910-2003|title=Sheldon Clark Reed (1910-2003)|work=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed SC|date=December 1974|title=A short history of genetic counseling|journal=Social Biology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=332–9|doi=10.1080/19485565.1974.9988131|pmid=4619717}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysgeneticcounselors.org/history.php|title=NYS Genetic Counseling Information Resource|website=www.nysgeneticcounselors.org|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Seymour|date=May 1984|title=Book Review: A Genetic Counseling CasebookA Genetic Counseling Casebook.

Marks Graduate Program in Human Genetics at Sarah Lawrence College|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[National Society of Genetic Counselors|National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/national-society-genetic-counselors-nsgc|title=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|publisher=The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic counselors==

=== Professional Roles ===
Genetic counselors work in a wide variety of patient-facing and non patient-facing settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/whoaregeneticcounselors|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : NSGC Professional Status Survey|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical genetic counselors may provide general care, or specialize in one or more areas. Examples include:

* Prenatal and Preconception – for women and their partners who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant
* Pediatric – for children with genetic, or suspected genetic, conditions and their family members
* Cancer – for patients with cancer and/or their family members
* Cardiovascular – for patients with diseases of the heart or circulatory system and/or their family members
* Neurology – for patients with diseases of the brain and nervous system and/or their family members.
* Assisted reproductive technology/ infertility – for couples struggling with fertility or who are carriers of genetic diseases
* Psychiatric – for patients living with mental illness and/or their family members

Outside the clinic, genetic counselors work in areas such as laboratories, research, education, public health settings, and corporate environments. Examples of roles include:

* Laboratory – Utilization management, provider and patient support, variant classification, and reporting
* Research – Coordinating research studies, patient recruitment, data collection and interpretation, manuscript preparation and grant writing
* Education – Professors, Directors of genetic counseling training programs
* Public Health – Newborn screening programs, population screening programs
* Non-profit – Patient support and advocacy organizations
* Corporate – Dedicated services for employees and their families

=== Education ===
A genetic counselor is an expert with a [[Master of Science]] degree in genetic counseling. Programs in North America are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC). There are currently 41 accredited programs in the United States, four accredited programs in Canada, and four programs with the intent to become accredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gceducation.org/Pages/Accredited-Programs.aspx|title=Accredited Programs|website=gceducation.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students enter the field from a variety of disciplines, including [[biology]]/biological sciences and social sciences such as [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/becomeageneticcounselor|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : Interested in Becoming a Genetic Counselor|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate school coursework includes topics such as human genetics, embyrology, ethics, research, and counseling theory and techniques. Clinical training including supervised rotations in prenatal, pediatric, adult, cancer, and other subspecialty clinics, as well as non-patient facing rotations in laboratories. Research training typically culminates in a capstone or thesis project.

=== Certification ===
In the United States genetic counselors are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. In Canada, genetic counselors are certified by the Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cagc-accg.ca/?page=117&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from an American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) accredited program who have met specific criteria are eligible to take the examination which is offered twice per year by the ABGC. Although not every company requires its counselors to possess a certification, the certification shows that the practitioner has met the standards "necessary to provide competent genetic counseling services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abgc.net/Certification/qualify_exam.asp|title=How do I qualify for the exam?|last=|first=|date=|website=American Board of Genetic Counseling|publisher=American Board of Genetic Counseling, Inc.|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State licensure  ===
As of October 2018, 25 states have passed genetic counselor licensure bills that require genetic counselors to meet a certain set of standards to practice. These states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Almost every other state in the US is in the process of obtaining genetic counseling licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/p/cm/ld/fid=19|title=States Issuing Licenses for Genetic Counselors|website=National Society of Genetic Counselors|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although genetic counseling has existed for over four decades, the first licenses for genetic counselors were not issued until 2002. Utah was the first state to do so. The [[American Society of Human Genetics]] (ASHG) has since encouraged more states to license genetic counselors before they are allowed to practice. ASHG argues that requiring practitioners to go through the necessary training and testing to obtain a license will ensure quality genetic services as well as allow for reimbursement for counselors’ services. Laws requiring licensure ensure that "professionals who call themselves genetic counselors are able to properly explain complicated test results that could confuse patients and families making important health decisions".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Genetic counselor licensure proponents call for more states to adopt licensing laws: Benefits of licensure extend to geneticists, counselors, and patients | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics. Part A | volume = 170A | issue = 1 | pages = 8–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26768329 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.37507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reimbursement and recognition ===
Insurance companies usually do not reimburse for unlicensed genetic counselors’ services. Patients who may benefit from genetic counseling may not be able to afford the service due to the expensive out-of-pocket cost. In addition, licensure allows genetic counselors to be searchable in most insurance companies’ databases which gives genetic counselors increased opportunities for earning revenue and clients the opportunity to see "the level of coverage insurers provide for their services".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Counseling session structure==
The goals of genetic counseling are to increase understanding of [[genetic diseases]], discuss disease management options, and explain the risks and benefits of testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Genetic Alliance Site | access-date = 29 October 2010 | url = http://www.geneticalliance.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling sessions focus on giving vital, unbiased information and non-directive assistance in the patient's decision-making process. Seymour Kessler, in 1979, first categorized sessions in five phases: an intake phase, an initial contact phase, the encounter phase, the summary phase, and a follow-up phase.&lt;ref name="pmid19798554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson JM, Gillam LH, Sahhar MA, Metcalfe SA | title = "Testing times, challenging choices": an Australian study of prenatal genetic counseling | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–37 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19798554 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-009-9248-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intake and follow-up phases occur outside of the actual counseling session. The initial contact phase is when the counselor and families meet and build rapport. The encounter phase includes dialogue between the counselor and the client about the nature of screening and diagnostic tests. The summary phase provides all the options and decisions available for the next step. If patients wish to go ahead with testing, an appointment is organized and the genetic counselor acts as the person to communicate the results. Result delivery can happen both in person or via phone. Often counselors will call out results to avoid patients having to come back in as results can take weeks to be processed. If further counseling is needed in a more personal setting, or it is determined that additional family members should be tested, a secondary appointment can be made.

==Reasons for testing and sub-specialties==
===Detecting conditions===
[[Diagnostic testing]] occurs when an individual is showing signs or symptoms associated with a specific condition. Genetic testing can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in order to provide better prognosis as well as medical management and/or treatment options. Testing can reveal conditions that—while debilitating without treatment—can be mild or asymptomatic with early treatment (such as [[phenylketonuria]]). Genetic tests are available for a number of genetic conditions, including but not limited to: [[Down syndrome]], [[Sickle cell disease]], [[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Muscular dystrophy]]. Establishing a genetic diagnosis alerts any other at-risk individuals in the family to consider testing, if appropriate.

Any reproductive risks (e.g. a chance to have a child with the same diagnosis) can also be explored after a diagnosis. Many disorders cannot occur unless both the mother and father pass on their genes, such as [[cystic fibrosis]]; this is known as [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance. Other [[autosomal dominant]] diseases can be inherited from one parent, such as [[Huntington disease]] and [[DiGeorge syndrome]]. Yet other genetic disorders are caused by an error or mutation occurring during the cell division process (e.g. [[aneuploidy]]) and are not hereditary.

[[Screening (medicine)|Screening tests]] are often used prior to diagnostic testing, designed to separate people according to a fixed characteristic or property, with the intention of detecting early evidence of disease. For example, if a screening test during a pregnancy (such as [[Prenatal testing|maternal blood screening]] or [[ultrasound]]) reveals a risk of a health issue or genetic condition, patients are encouraged to receive genetic counseling to learn additional information regarding the suspected condition and about their options with discussion of management, therapy and treatments available for the conditions, including those after delivery, and those during pregnancy, such as the option to terminate the pregnancy. Patients may decline additional screening and testing, elect to proceed to diagnostic testing, or pursue further screening tests to refine the risk during the pregnancy.

[[Predictive testing|Presymptomatic or predictive testing]] occurs when an individual knows of a specific diagnosis (typically adult onset) in their family and has other affected relatives, but they themselves do not manifest any clinical findings at the time when they seek testing. The decision about whether or not to proceed with presymptomatic testing should entail a thoughtful approach and consideration of various medical, reproductive, social, insurance, and financial factors, with no “right” or “wrong” answer. Availability of treatment and medical management options for each specific diagnosis, as well as the genetics and inheritance pattern of the particular condition should be reviewed as inherited conditions can have reduced [[penetrance]].

Insurance and legal issues should also be discussed during genetic counseling. There are laws in the United States such as [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act|GINA]] ([https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr493/text Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act]) and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]] that provide certain protections against discrimination for individuals with genetic diagnoses.

=== Adult genetics ===
Adult or general genetics clinics serve patients who are diagnosed with genetic conditions that begin to show signs or symptoms in adulthood. Many genetic conditions have varying ages of onset, ranging from an infantile form to an adult form. Genetic counseling can facilitate the decision making process by providing the patient/family with education about the genetic condition as well as the medical management options available to individuals at risk of developing the condition. Adult-onset disorders may overlap multiple specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilchrist DM | title = Medical genetics: 3. An approach to the adult with a genetic disorder | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 9 | pages = 1021–9 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12403743 | pmc = 134180 | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/9/1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ART/Infertility genetics ===
Genetic counseling is an integral part of the process for patients utilizing [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic testing]] (PGT), formerly called preimplantation genetic diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg-Strassler D,  Cabey R, Armenti EM, Jordan A | journal = Fertility and Sterility | date = September 2016 | volume = 106 | issue = 3 Supplement | page = e370| title = Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) genetic counseling; but why? The patient experience|issn = 0015-0282|doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.07.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of PGT and all require [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) using [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing|title=Preimplantation genetic testing | work = UpToDate }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGT-M, for monogenic disorders, involves testing embryos for a specific condition before it is implanted into the mother. This technique is currently being done for disorders with childhood onset, such as Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs and Muscular Dystrophy, as well as adult-onset conditions, including Huntington’s Disease, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome. PGT-SR, for structural rearrangements, involves testing embryos to establish a pregnancy unaffected by a structural chromosomal abnormality (translocation). PGT-A, for aneuploidy, was formerly called preimplantation genetic screening, and involved testing embryos to identify any de novo aneuploidy.

Genetic counseling can also involve medical evaluation and clinical work-up for couples with infertility and/or recurrent pregnancy loss, as these histories can be associated with parental chromosome aberrations (such as [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] or [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]) and other genetic conditions.

=== Cardiovascular genetics ===
A rapidly expanding field in genetic counseling is cardiovascular genetics. More than 1 in 200 people have an inherited [[cardiovascular disease]]. Hereditary cardiac conditions range from common diseases, such as high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, to rare diseases like [[Long QT syndrome|Long QT Syndrome]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], aortic and [[vascular disease]]s.  Genetic counselors who specialize in cardiovascular disease have developed skills specific to the management of and counseling for cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular genetic counselors are also integral in local and national efforts to prevent sudden cardiac death (the leading cause of sudden death in young people) by identifying patients with known or suspected heritable cardiovascular diseases and promoting cascade family screening or testing of at-risk relatives.

Common referral reasons include:

* Cardiomyopathy, including, [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] and familial idiopathic [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* Arrhythmia, including [[Long QT syndrome]] and [[Brugada syndrome]]
* Vascular disease, including [[Marfan syndrome]] and aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (&lt;50 years old)
* Other heritable heart defects (e.g. conotruncal defects, left ventricular outflow tract defects)
* [[Familial hypercholesterolemia]]
* Family history of unexplained sudden death

Guidelines on cardiovascular genetics are published by multiple professional societies.&lt;ref name="pmid24011539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Priori SG, Wilde AA, Horie M, Cho Y, Behr ER, Berul C, Blom N, Brugada J, Chiang CE, Huikuri H, Kannankeril P, Krahn A, Leenhardt A, Moss A, Schwartz PJ, Shimizu W, Tomaselli G, Tracy C | display-authors = 6 | title = HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in May 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 | journal = Heart Rhythm | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 1932–63 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24011539 | doi = 10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.05.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29567486"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger RE, Givertz MM, Ho CY, Judge DP, Kantor PF, McBride KL, Morales A, Taylor MR, Vatta M, Ware SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic Evaluation of Cardiomyopathy-A Heart Failure Society of America Practice Guideline | journal = Journal of Cardiac Failure | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–302 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29567486 | doi = 10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22068434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gersh BJ, Maron BJ, Bonow RO, Dearani JA, Fifer MA, Link MS, Naidu SS, Nishimura RA, Ommen SR, Rakowski H, Seidman CE, Towbin JA, Udelson JE, Yancy CW | display-authors = 6 | title = 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines | journal = Circulation | volume = 124 | issue = 24 | pages = e783–831 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22068434 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e318223e2bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25173338"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott PM, Anastasakis A, Borger MA, Borggrefe M, Cecchi F, Charron P, Hagege AA, Lafont A, Limongelli G, Mahrholdt H, McKenna WJ, Mogensen J, Nihoyannopoulos P, Nistri S, Pieper PG, Pieske B, Rapezzi C, Rutten FH, Tillmanns C, Watkins H | display-authors = 6 | title = 2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the Task Force for the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 39 | pages = 2733–79 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25173338 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21600525"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg AC, Hopkins PN, Toth PP, Ballantyne CM, Rader DJ, Robinson JG, Daniels SR, Gidding SS, de Ferranti SD, Ito MK, McGowan MP, Moriarty PM, Cromwell WC, Ross JL, Ziajka PE | display-authors = 6 | title = Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia | journal = Journal of Clinical Lipidology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S1–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21600525 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacl.2011.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26510694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gidding SS, Champagne MA, de Ferranti SD, Defesche J, Ito MK, Knowles JW, McCrindle B, Raal F, Rader D, Santos RD, Lopes-Virella M, Watts GF, Wierzbicki AS | display-authors = 6 | title = The Agenda for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 22 | pages = 2167–92 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26510694 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary cancer genetics ===
Cancer genetic counselors see individuals with a personal diagnosis and/or family history of cancer or symptoms of an inherited cancer syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling About Cancer|last=Schneider|first=Katherine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-1118119914|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors take a family history and assess for hereditary risk, or risk that can be passed down from generation to generation. If indicated, they can coordinate genetic testing, typically via blood or saliva sample, to evaluate for hereditary cancer risk.  Personalized medical management and cancer screening recommendations can be provided based on results of genetic testing and/or the family history of cancer. While most cancers are sporadic (not inherited), some are more likely to have a hereditary factor, particularly when occurring at young ages or when clustering in families.

===Neurogenetics===
Genetic counselors specializing in neurogenetics are involved in the care of individuals who have or are at risk to develop conditions affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or peripheral nervous system (the nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to other places in the body, such as the feet and hands, skeletal  muscles, and internal organs). Effects of these conditions can lead to various impairments some examples of which include cognitive decline, intellectual disability, seizures, uncontrolled movements (e.g. ataxia, chorea), muscle weakness, paralysis, or atrophy. Examples of neurogenetic disorders include:

*Brain malformation syndromes, including [[lissencephaly]] and [[polymicrogyria]]

Prenatal genetic counseling may help with the decision-making process by walking patients through examples of what some people might do in similar situations, and their rationale for choosing that option. Decisions made by patients are affected by factors including timing, accuracy of information provided by tests, and risk and benefits of the tests. This discussion enables patients to place the information and circumstances into the context of their own lives, and in the context of their own values.&lt;ref name="pmid20235896"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stefansdottir V, Skirton H, Jonasson K, Hardardottir H, Jonsson JJ|date=July 2010|title=Effects of knowledge, education, and experience on acceptance of first trimester screening for chromosomal anomalies|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=89|issue=7|pages=931–8|doi=10.3109/00016341003686073|pmid=20235896}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may choose to undergo noninvasive screening (e.g. [[ultrasound]], [[triple screen]], [[cell-free fetal DNA]] screening) or invasive diagnostic testing ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]). Invasive diagnostic tests possess a small risk of [[miscarriage]] (1-2%) but provide more definitive results. Testing is offered to provide a definitive answer regarding the presence of a certain genetic condition or chromosomal abnormality.

=== Psychiatric genetics  ===
Psychiatric genetic counseling is a sub-specialty within genetic counseling focused on helping people living with a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] and/or their family members understand both the genetic and environmental factors that contributed to their illness and address associated emotions such as guilt or self-blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Talk with Families About Genetics and Psychiatric Illness|last=Peay|first=Holly|last2=Austin|first2=Jehannine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher= Norton |location= New York, London |year=2011|isbn=978-0-393-70549-2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors also discuss strategies to promote recovery and protect [[mental health]] and address any questions on chances for recurrence in other family members. While currently there is no single gene solely responsible for causing a psychiatric disorder, there is strong evidence from family, [[twin studies]], and [[Genome-wide Association Studies|genome-wide-association studies]] that both multiple genes and environment interact together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giegling I, Hosak L, Mössner R, Serretti A, Bellivier F, Claes S, Collier DA, Corrales A, DeLisi LE, Gallo C, Gill M, Kennedy JL, Leboyer M, Maier W, Marquez M, Massat I, Mors O, Muglia P, Nöthen MM, Ospina-Duque J, Owen MJ, Propping P, Shi Y, St Clair D, Thibaut F, Cichon S, Mendlewicz J, O'Donovan MC, Rujescu D | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetics of schizophrenia: A consensus paper of the WFSBP Task Force on Genetics | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 492–505 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28112043 | doi = 10.1080/15622975.2016.1268715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other areas of genetic counseling, patients at all different stages of life (pediatric, adult, prenatal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inglis A, Morris E, Austin J | title = Prenatal genetic counselling for psychiatric disorders | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–13 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27466037 | pmc = 5247258 | doi = 10.1002/pd.4878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan J, Virani A, Austin JC | title = Ethical issues associated with genetic counseling in the context of adolescent psychiatry | journal = Applied &amp; Translational Genomics | volume = 5 | pages = 23–9 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26937355 | pmc = 4745399 | doi = 10.1016/j.atg.2015.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can have psychiatric genetic counseling. Since the etiology of psychiatric disorders is complex and not fully understood, the utility of genetic testing is not as clear as it is in Mendelian or single gene disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demkow U, Wolańczyk T | title = Genetic tests in major psychiatric disorders-integrating molecular medicine with clinical psychiatry-why is it so difficult? | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = e1151 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28608853 | pmc = 5537634 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2017.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that individuals who receive psychiatric genetic counseling have significant increases in feelings of empowerment and self-efficacy after genetic counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moldovan R, Pintea S, Austin J | title = The Efficacy of Genetic Counseling for Psychiatric Disorders: a Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 1341–1347 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28616830 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-017-0113-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric genetic counselors can help "dispel mistaken notions about psychiatric disorders, calm needless anxiety, and help those at risk to draw up a rational plan of action based on the best available information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuang MT | title = Genetic counseling for psychiatric patients and their families | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 135 | issue = 12 | pages = 1465–75 | date = December 1978 | pmid = 717559 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.135.12.1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychosocial aspects of genetic counseling ==
There are different approaches to genetic counseling. Some counselors favor a more purely psycho-educational approach while others incorporate more psycho-therapeutic techniques. Genetic counseling is psycho-educational as patients "learn how genetics contributes to their health risks and then process what this means and how it feels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biesecker|first=Barbara B | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-16 |pages=1–5 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0005616.pub3 | isbn=978-0-470-01590-2 |title=ELS |chapter=Genetic Counselling: Psychological Issues }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapeutic ===
"Whether the process of genetic counseling is a form of [[psychotherapy]] is up for debate". The relationship between the client and counselor is similar as are the goals of the sessions. As a psychotherapist aims to help his client improve his wellbeing, a genetic counselor also helps his client to address a "situational health threat that similarly threatens client wellbeing". Due to the lack of studies which compare genetic counseling to the practice of psychotherapy, it is hard to say with certainty whether genetic counseling can be "conceptualized as a short-term, applied, specific type of psychotherapy". However, there few existing studies suggest that genetic counseling falls "significantly short of psychotherapeutic counseling" because genetic counseling sessions primarily consist of the distribution of information without much emphasis placed on explaining any long-term impacts to the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biesecker B, Austin J, Caleshu C | title = Response to A Different Vantage Point Commentary: Psychotherapeutic Genetic Counseling, Is it? | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 334–336 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27804046 | pmc = 5383505 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-016-0025-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic counselors as support===
Genetic counselors provide supportive counseling to families, serve as patient advocates and refer individuals and families to community or state support services. They serve as educators and resource people for other health care professionals and for the general public. Many engage in research activities related to the field of medical genetics and genetic counseling. When communicating increased risk, counselors anticipate the likely distress and prepare patients for the results. Counselors help clients cope with and adapt to the emotional, psychological, medical, social, and economic consequences of the test results.

Each individual considers their family needs, social setting, cultural background, and religious beliefs when interpreting their risk.&lt;ref name="pmid19711880"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan SM | title = Prenatal genetic testing | journal = Pediatric Annals | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 426–30 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19711880 | doi = 10.3928/00904481-20090723-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients must evaluate their reasoning to continue with testing at all. Counselors are present to put all the possibilities in perspective and encourage clients to take time to think about their decision. When a risk is found, counselors frequently reassure parents that they were not responsible for the result. An informed choice without pressure or coercion is made when all relevant information has been given and understood.

After counseling for other hereditary conditions, the patient may be presented with the option of having genetic testing. In some circumstances no genetic testing is indicated, other times it may be useful to begin the testing process with an affected family member. The genetic counselor also reviews the advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing with the patient.

===Attitudes toward genetic counseling and genetic testing===
Many studies have examined the attitudes of the lay public toward genetic counseling and genetic testing. Barriers to obtaining genetic counseling include lack of understanding of genetics by both patients and healthcare providers, concerns about cost and insurance, and fears of stigma and/or discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher TM, Bucciarelli M, Kavalukas SL, Baker MJ, Saunders BD | title = Attitudes toward genetic counseling and testing in patients with inherited endocrinopathies | journal = Endocrine Practice | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 1039–1044 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28613942 | doi = 10.4158/EP171875.OR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haga SB, Barry WT, Mills R, Ginsburg GS, Svetkey L, Sullivan J, Willard HF | display-authors = 6 | title = Public knowledge of and attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing | journal = Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–35 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23406207 | pmc = 3609633 | doi = 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scuffham TM, McInerny-Leo A, Ng SK, Mellick G | title = Knowledge and attitudes towards genetic testing in those affected with Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–77 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24018619 | pmc = 3955457 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0168-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No simple correlation has been found between the change in technology to the changes in values and beliefs towards genetic testing.&lt;ref name="pmid22476359"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer E, Couper MP, Raghunathan TE, Van Hoewyk J, Antonucci TC | title = Trends in U.S. Attitudes Toward Genetic Testing, 1990-2004 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 446–458 | date = Fall 2008 | pmid = 22476359 | pmc = 3045776 | doi = 10.1093/poq/nfn033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==
In 2018, there are nearly 7000 genetic counselors practicing worldwide, across at least 28 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abacan|first=MaryAnn|last2=Alsubaie|first2=Lamia|last3=Barlow-Stewart|first3=Kristine|last4=Caanen|first4=Beppy|last5=Cordier|first5=Christophe|last6=Courtney|first6=Eliza|last7=Davoine|first7=Emeline|last8=Edwards|first8=Janice|last9=Elackatt|first9=Niby J.|date=2018-10-05|title=The Global State of the Genetic Counseling Profession|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|issn=1018-4813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Genetic counseling in China (mainland) has been primarily provided by pediatricians or obstetricians for prenatal or birth defect diagnoses. Most genetic tests can only be performed in academic institutions as research tests or in commercial direct-to-consumer companies for non-clinical use.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao X, Wang P, Tao X, Zhong N | title = Genetic services and testing in China | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 379–90 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23595912 | pmc = 3739851 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0144-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, genetic counseling is steered by the '''Chinese Board of Genetic Counseling (CBGC)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbgc.org.cn/en/|title=中国遗传学会遗传咨询分会|author=|date=|website=www.cbgc.org.cn|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization. CBGC is composed of senior experts engaged in genetic education and research. CBGC is committed to establishing standardized procedures of genetic counseling, training qualified genetic counselors, improving health for all, and reducing the incidence of birth defects. CBGC was established in 2015 and is the major professional organization for genetic counselors in mainland China, providing training through short term online and in-person lectures, educational conferences, and certification for trainees.    

Genetics education in China began in the 1980s when selected medical schools began offering genetics courses that focused predominantly on molecular genetics and had limited clinical content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Xu T, Yashar BM | title = Genetics educational needs in China: physicians' experience and knowledge of genetic testing | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 757–60 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25503494 | doi = 10.1038/gim.2014.182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, there are no official master’s level graduate programs in genetic counseling or clinical genetics in China, and there is great variability in the duration and content of genetics curricula among medical schools and professional organizations.

The [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Health]] has not yet recognized genetic counselors as an independent health care occupation. There are no official statistics for the number of health care professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, and lab technicians) who are providing genetic counseling services in China.

=== South Africa ===
Genetic Counselling is a developing field in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kromberg JG, Wessels TM, Krause A | title = Roles of genetic counselors in South Africa | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–61 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23723047 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-013-9606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are about 20 registered genetic counsellors practicing in the country. In South Africa, genetic counsellors work within academic institutions, in the private health sector and more recently, private genetic laboratories. A few qualified genetic counsellors have been employed outside of the country or in other professions, owing to funding limitations that have impacted employment opportunities, particularly in the academic/public health sector.

The first Genetic Counselling Programme in South Africa started in 1989 at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in Johannesburg, in the Gauteng province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/postgraduate/health/genetic-counselling/|title=Genetic Counselling - Wits University|last=Johannesburg|first=The University of the Witwatersrand,|website=www.wits.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second programme started in 2004 at the [[University of Cape Town]] in the Western Cape province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za/hg/teaching/msc/courses|title=Genetic Counselling Courses             {{!}} Division of Human Genetics|website=www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the only two programmes offering Masters level genetic counselling training in South Africa. Currently these courses are running at full capacity.  This is a two year degree and includes a research component. The majority of students enter the Masters programme with a science background but those with a psychology background are also be considered.

The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za|title=Home Page - HPCSA|website=www.hpcsa.co.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires two years of internship. Often the first year forms part of the Masters degree in Genetic Counselling and a further 12 month internship thereafter. Genetic Counsellors are required by law to register with the HPCSA in order to practice as genetic counsellors. At the end of the training period, registrants submit a portfolio to  HPCSA for assessment. If successful, the intern will be registered with the HPCSA and will be able to practice as a Genetic Counsellor in South Africa.

There is a professional organisation for Genetic Counsellors in South Africa, '''Genetic Counselling South Africa (GC-SA),''' which provides information and guidance to the HPCSA and others regarding professional issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org/about/focus-groups/genetic-counselling-south-africa/|title=Genetic Counselling South Africa – SASHG|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCSA is a focus group of the South African Society of Human Genetics (SASHG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org|title=SASHG – Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG)|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The majority of Genetic Counsellors in the UK work in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genetics/services/|title=Genetic testing and counselling|website=nhs.uk|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the 33 Regional Clinical Genetics Services (some re-named Genomic Medicine Centres in England), Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Others work in specialist roles in the NHS, education, policy or research. A minority work in the private sector.

The '''Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors (AGNC)''' is the UK's professional organisation representing genetic counsellors, genetic nurses and non-medical, patient-facing staff working within the discipline of Clinical Genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agnc.org.uk|title=Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors|website=www.agnc.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently (March 2018) 330 AGNC members within the UK. The AGNC is one of the constituent groups of the British Society for Genetic Medicine (BSGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsgm.org.uk|title=British Society for Genetic Medicine|website=www.bsgm.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 2 year MSc in Genetic Counselling program established in the UK was from the [[University of Manchester]] 1992, followed by [[Cardiff University]] in Wales in 2000. 2016 saw major changes in the way genetic counsellors are trained in England. A 3-year training programme funded by Health Education England, the Scientist Training Programme (STP) uses a combination of work-based training in Genomic Medicine Centres and a part time MSc in Genetics (Genomic Counselling) from the University of Manchester. Recruitment is performed nationally through the National School of Healthcare Science (NSHCS). A 3-year part time MSc in Genetic and Genomic Counselling is also now delivered by Cardiff University, through blended learning, with most of the teaching delivered online, alongside some short face-to-face teaching blocks in Wales. A 2-year MSc Genetic and Genomic Counselling program began at the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland in 2016. Prerequisites for acceptance on all the programmes include a degree in a relevant science or a nursing or midwifery qualification, and experience in a caring role.  All genetic counselling training programmes are accredited by the UK Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB) and the European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eshg.org/index.php?id=113&amp;L=0|title=European Society of Human Genetics: Training in Genetics|website=www.eshg.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic counsellors in the UK are regulated through the Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcrb.org.uk|title=Home - Genetic Counsellor Registration Board|website=Genetic Counsellor Registration Board | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although currently GCRB registration is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormond KE, Laurino MY, Barlow-Stewart K, Wessels TM, Macaulay S, Austin J, Middleton A | title = Genetic counseling globally: Where are we now? | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–107 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29575600 | pmc = 5947883 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.c.31607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCRB registry was accredited in 2016 by the Professional Standards Authority under its Accredited Registers programme. Over 200 genetic counsellors are currently registered through the GCRB. Genetic Counsellors trained through the STP programme are expected to be eligible to apply for statutory regulation through the Health Care Professions Council and it is planned that soon there will be equivalence arrangements with the GCRB to ensure statutory regulation for GCRB registered genetic counsellors.

The '''George Town CBD''' is the [[central business district]] within [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], the capital city of the state of [[Penang]] in [[Malaysia]]. As the term implies, the CBD contains the highest concentration of financial and banking services within [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], serving as the city's financial heart.
[[File:Gurney Drive, George Town in 2018.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]] forms part of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]'s second CBD]]
Traditionally, [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]] has been regarded as the [[central business district]] of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]. One of the first streets to be created in [[Penang]], [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]] was where several international banks built their branches in the late 19th century.  To this day, many of the banks remain along the street. In addition, within the vicinity of [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]], governmental buildings were constructed, making the area the administrative centre of [[Penang]] for much of the [[History of Penang|state's history]].

In recent decades, various banking, financial and auditing services have been concentrated at [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] as well, turning the road into [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]'s second CBD.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2003/12/15/penangs-new-financial-hub/|title=Penang’s new financial hub - Business News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjoining [[Gurney Drive]], with a high concentration of skyscrapers, also forms part of the city's newer CBD.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/penang-dap-rep-put-all-projects-in-gurney-drive-on-hold|title=Penang DAP rep: Put all projects in Gurney Drive on hold|date=2015-05-22|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, this district coincides with the particular area that was first explored and developed by Captain [[Francis Light]] after his founding of [[Penang]] in 1786. It is centred at [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]] and [[Light Street, George Town, Penang|Light Street]], which are among the first streets to be created on [[Penang Island]]. It is loosely bounded by [[Pitt Street, George Town|Pitt Street]] (now ''Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling'') to the west, [[Chulia Street, George Town|Chulia Street]] to the south and [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]] along the city's eastern shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Society in the Straits of Melaka: Dutch Melaka and English Penang, 1780-1830|last=Nordin Hussin|first=|publisher=National University of Singapore|year=2007|isbn=9789971693541|location=Singapore|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penang.gov.my/dmedia/879-penang-investment-seminar|title=Portal Rasmi Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang - Penang Investment Seminar|website=www.penang.gov.my|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBD therefore covers the several international banks along [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]], such as [[Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Bank]], [[HSBC]], [[OCBC Bank|Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation]], [[United Overseas Bank]] and [[Bank of China]], as well as administrative buildings like the [[City Hall, Penang|City Hall]] and the [[Penang State Assembly Building|State Assembly Building]], in a manner similar to the [[Civic District]] within [[Downtown Core|downtown]] [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/05/17/banking-in-on-preserving-citys-heritage-financial-institutions-centre-made-up-of-three-historical-bu/|title=Banking in on preserving city's heritage - Community {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.uob.com.my/uob_branch_locator.html|title=UOB Branch Locator|website=www1.uob.com.my|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City Hall, Penang|City Hall]], built in 1903, houses the head office of the [[Penang Island City Council]], while the [[Penang State Assembly Building|State Assembly Building]] is the meeting place of the [[Penang State Legislative Assembly]].

Due to the numerous Malaysian and international banks that operate within the CBD, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] serves as the commercial centre for northern [[Malaysia]].

In addition, the CBD serves as a transportation hub within [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]. The city is linked with the [[Malay Peninsula]] via [[Rapid Ferry]], with its [[Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal|Ferry Terminal at Weld Quay]]. Right next to the Ferry Terminal is a [[Rapid Penang]] bus terminal, where most bus routes within [[Penang Island]] begin and terminate.

In the 1990s, as [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]'s banks began reassessing their spatial requirements to accommodate greater business volumes, a number of commercial developments commenced along [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Dreams: An Inquiry Into Power, Cultural Production and the Cityscape in Contemporary Urban Penang, Malaysia|last=Goh|first=Beng Lan|publisher=SEAP Publications|year=2002|isbn=9780877277309|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial skyscrapers along [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] quickly attracted various banking, auditing and other financial services, as the newer buildings offer more space and amenities that the colonial-era buildings at [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]] lacked. By the early 2000s, [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] emerged the city's second CBD.

In addition, [[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]], which adjoins [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] and also has a high concentration of skyscrapers, is now considered as part of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]'s newer CBD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plans have been drawn up to attract financial services to the popular seafront promenade, which already functions as one of the more prominent shopping streets in [[Penang]]. In 2016, the [[Gurney Wharf]] project, which aims to create a seaside recreational park along [[Gurney Drive]], was launched, with land reclamation ongoing off the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/penangs-gurney-drive-bund-turns-brown-waters-jade-green|title=Penang's Gurney Drive bund turns brown waters jade green|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation of financial services along [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] and [[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]] is partly fueled by the inscription of the city centre as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 2008. The new [[UNESCO]] rulings include a building restriction on construction works exceeding five storeys or 18 metres. As both [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] and [[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]] lie outside the [[UNESCO]]-protected site, commercial properties along these coastal roads are not impacted by the new building guidelines.

'''Government procurement''' or '''public procurement''' is the [[procurement]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]] and [[construction]] on behalf of a public authority, such as a [[government]] agency. With 10 to 20% of [[GDP]], government procurement accounts for a substantial part of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/govpro.html Global Trade Negotiations Home Page] at [[Harvard University]], accessed 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent [[fraud]], [[waste]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], or local [[protectionism]], the laws of most countries regulate government procurement to some extent. Laws usually require the procuring authority to issue public [[Call for bids|tenders]] if the value of the procurement exceeds a certain threshold.

Government procurement is also the subject of the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]] (GPA), a [[plurilateral]] international treaty under the auspices of the [[WTO]].

==Overview==

=== Need for government procurement ===
Government procurement is necessary because governments cannot produce all the inputs for the goods they provide themselves. Governments usually provide [[public good]]s, e.g. national defense or public infrastructure. Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable, which means that one individual's consumption does not diminish the quantity or quality of the commodity available to others, and individuals cannot be prevented from freely consuming the commodity, or [[Free-rider problem|"free-riding"]]. Consequently, private markets cannot provide public goods. Instead the government provides those goods and finances them by raising taxes from all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712588185|title=Economics|last=Mankiw|first=Nicholas Gregory|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|others=Taylor, Mark P. 1958-|year=|isbn=9781844808700|edition= 2nd|location=Andover|pages=223–226|oclc=712588185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public goods, governments often also provide [[merit good]]s, such as education or health care. Merit goods are [[private good]]s which are rival and excludable and are therefore provided by private markets. Nevertheless, governments also provide merit goods because of reasons of [[Equity (economics)|equity]] and fairness and because they have [[Externality|positive externalities]] for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39485400|title=Economics of the Public Sector|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|date=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=0393966518|edition= 3rd|location=New York|pages=86–88|oclc=39485400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide public and merit goods, the government has to buy input factors from private companies, e.g. police cars, school buildings, uniforms etc. This process is called government or public procurement.

=== Problems ===
Government procurement involves a high risk of [[corruption]] because of the great size of financial turnover and the complexitiy of many procurement processes in which businesses interact very closely with politicians and civil servants. Often the personal interests of the public officials are not the same as the interests of the public. Such a conflict of interest problem, known as the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent-problem]], increases the risk of corruption. According to [[OECD]], the highest percentage of bribery cases occur in the area of public procurement to influence the awarding of public contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Corruption-Public-Procurement-Brochure.pdf|title=Preventing Corruption in Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in public procurement causes inefficiencies and high costs to the public. In order to prevent corruption and to ensure transparency and competition among suppliers, public procurement is subject to legal regulation.

===Scope===
Government procurement regulations normally cover all [[public works]], services and supply contracts entered into by a public authority. However, there may be exceptions. These most notably cover [[military acquisition]]s, which account for large parts of government expenditures. The GPA and EU procurement law allow of exceptions where public tendering would violate a country's essential security interests. Additionally, certain politically or economically sensitive sectors, such as public health, energy supply or public transport, may also be treated differently.&lt;ref name="Prieß: Global Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prieß|first=Hans-Joachim|author2=Harvey, Diana|author3=Friton, Pascal|title=Global Overview|journal=Prieß (2012)|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The procedure of government procurement in Brazil is regulated for a lot of different laws with different procedures depending on the importance and the value of the procurement. The most important law about government procurement which contains basic rules of public procurements and administrative contracts is the Law nº 8.666, 21 june 1993, which contains rules for public tenders and for restricted tenders. There are other different rules to regulate procurement public services, as Law nº 8.987, 13 february 1995 (Concession and Permission of Public Services); Law nº 12.462, 4 august 2011 (Differentiated Procurement - RDC in portuguese) and Law nº 10.520, 17 july 2002, with deal with presential auction. In the internet field (e-procurement) there are executive orders (Decretos) which regulate public procurement as Decree nº 5.450, 31 may 2005 and Decree nº 7.982, 23 january 2013. This latter regulates the procedure of specific situations of sharing acquisitions of goods or under portioned deliverings.&lt;ref&gt;All information can be found in https://www.comprasgovernamentais.gov.br/index.php/legislacao&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Public procurement in Canada is regulated on various governmental levels (federal, provincial, municipal). Most federal procurement is organized by the [[Public Services and Procurement Canada]] (PSPC) agency and is governed by their Code of Conduct of Procurement in combination with principles laid out in the Federal Accountability Act and in the Financial Administration Act. Public procurement is guided by the principles of fairness, transparency, openness, and non-discrimination and complies with all international agreements that Canada is a member of (WTO [[Agreement on Government Procurement|Government Procurement Agreement]] [GPA], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]], and various bilateral FTAs). Foreign suppliers from member nations to these agreements can bid on Canadian government procurements and are treated the same as domestic suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html|title=Code of Conduct for Procurement.

The principal statutory provisions regulating government procurement are:

*Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (1996)
*Financial Administration Act (1985) and the Government Contracts Regulations &lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html Government Contracts Regulations], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*Defence Production Act 1985 (consolidated version published 2011) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207971 Defence Production Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. D-1) (consolidated version of January 30, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, bids must be solicited by the procuring department unless estimated expenditure does not exceed $25,000, or $100,000 "where the contract is for the acquisition of architectural, engineering and other services required in respect of the planning, design, preparation or supervision of the construction, repair, renovation or restoration of a work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/page-2.html#docCont Government Contracts Regulation 6b], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; For contracts above $25,000, tenders are published on the transparent Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). A non-competitive procurement process is only used in certain special circumstances. One such area of exception are security-related procurements. In that case the Defence Production Act applies, which allows using a special process and favouring domestic suppliers in acquiring defence supplies and conducting defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-businesses/selling-to-the-government-of-canada/the-procurement-process|title=The Procurement Process|last=Engagement|first=Government of Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada, Acquisitions Branch, Office of Small and Medium Enterprises and Strategic|website=buyandsell.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
The Ministry of Finance in [[East Timor]] or Timor-Leste is responsible for the oversight of government procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Finance, [https://www.mof.gov.tl/government-procurement/?lang=en Procurement], accessed 13 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Government uses the Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal  for purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprocurement.gov.tl/public/indexeprtl?&amp;lang=en Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Government procurement in [[Ethiopia]] is governed by the Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation No.649/2009,&lt;ref name=Eth&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4f0l6J9WQrBYzNmZmJiZjEtYjkyYS00NjhiLWFkMmEtOTA5NjdjMTdkNGEz/view Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation], 9 September 2009, accessed 6 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the proclamation on Procedures of Public Procurement and Establishing its Supervisory Agency, Proclamation No. 430/2005. The Public Procurement
and Property Administration Agency advises the federal government on "on all public procurement and property administration policies, principles and implementation" and provides "technical assistance to the regional governments and city administrations".&lt;ref name=Eth /&gt;

===European Union===
{{Main|Government procurement in the European Union}}
Government procurement in the European Union accounts for more than EUR 2.2 trillion, or 14% of the EU GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement_en|title=Public Procurement - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been regulated and harmonized by [[European Union law|community law]] since the 1970s in order to guarantee transparency and non-discrimination of EU companies in government procurement in all member states. EU laws apply only to tenders that exceed certain thresholds in value. These thresholds vary depending on the area the contract is for and if the procurement is done by a central government or by other public authorities (e.g. municipal government). National laws are applied for tenders below these threshold values.&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/public-tenders/rules-procedures/index_en.htm|title=Rules &amp; procedures|website=Your Europe - Business|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant EU Directives regarding government procurement currently in force are [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1415011920358&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0081 Directive 2009/81], [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024 Directive 2014/24], and [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0025 Directive 2014/25].

There are five different procedures for public procurement:&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"/&gt;

*Open procedure: any company is allowed to submit a tender
*Restricted procedure: only companies that have been preselected are allowed to submit a tender
*Negotiated procedure: there are direct negotiations with at least three companies
*Competitive dialogue: if it is not possible to define technical specifications at the beginning, a competitive dialogue with at least three companies is started after which tenders can be submitted. This procedure is applied for complex procurements.
*Electronic auctions: companies that pass a pre-evaluation process can bid in electronic auctions for public contracts

The European Commission is working on further improving efficiency and transparency in government procurement in the EU with its current public procurement strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/strategy_en|title=Public procurement strategy - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
Government procurement in [[Austria]] is regulated by the Federal Procurement Act 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Stalzer, J., [https://www.schoenherr.eu/publications/publication-detail/austria-imminent-implementation-of-public-procurement-directives/ Austria: Imminent implementation of public procurement directives], accessed 14 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium|Belgian]] legislation on public procurement is set out in the Act of 17 June 2016 implementing the 2014 EU procurement directives.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guide, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/belgium Public Procurement 2018: Belgium], accessed 27 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of 17 June 2016 on public procurement and on concession contracts, and the Law of 16 February 2017 on remedies, failed to meet the EU's transposition deadline (18 April 2016). [[Royal order (Belgium)|Royal Decree]]s issued on 18 April 2017 for general public procurement, 18 June 2017 for procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, 22 June 2017 containing new rules on the performance of public works contracts and concession contracts for public works and 25 June 2017, for the award and performance of concession contracts, have augmented the earlier laws.&lt;ref name=vbb&gt;Van Bael and Bellis, [https://www.vbb.com/media/Insights_Articles/VBB_Memorandum_Public_Procurement_27_07_2017.pd.pdf New Belgian Regulatory Framework Governing Public Procurement – Overview of Main Novelties], accessed 29 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 51 of the Royal Decree of 18 April 2017 includes a "revolving door mechanism", which targets the situation where a person previously working for a contracting authority is now being employed by an economic operator involved in a public procurement procedure established by that contracting authority. In this type of situation the person would be presumed to have a [[conflict of interest]] for a two-year period following the termination of his/her employment with the contracting authority.&lt;ref name=vbb /&gt;

====Bulgaria====
Government procurement in Bulgaria is a critical area in corruption risk. Public procurement contracts have been awarded to a handful of companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made selection or award criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/bg.pdf|title=Public procurement in Bulgaria|work=Study on administrative capacity in the EU|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian public procurement portal reported in September 2016 that since the beginning of 2016, "a total of 15,105 contracts were signed on the basis of public procurement orders".&lt;ref&gt;Sofia News Agency, [http://www.novinite.com/articles/176510/15%2C105+Public+Procurement+Contracts+Signed+So+Far+in+2016 15,105 Public Procurement Contracts Signed So Far in 2016], accessed 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2015, the [[Bulgarian government]] announced a 130-kilometer extension to the barbed wire [[Bulgarian border barrier|border fence]] along its border with [[Turkey]] in order to completely secure the land border.

====Finland====
In [[Finland]] the following legislation applies to government procurement:
*Act on Public Contracts and Concession Contracts (Act no. 1397 of 2016, effective 1 January 2017) &lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, [http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2016/en20161397.pdf Act on Public Procurement and Concession Contracts], accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A Government Decree on Public Contracts was also in force until 2017.&lt;ref name=Finland /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (Finland)|Ministry of Employment and the Economy]] is responsible for the preparation of legislation concerning public procurement. The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA) oversees public procurement: section 139 of the Act on Public Procurement and Concession Contracts mandates the FCCA to supervise compliance with public contracts legislation and to provide 'administrative guidance' or if necessary to issue a caution to a non-compliant public authority.&lt;ref&gt;FCCA, [https://www.kkv.fi/en/current-issues/press-releases/2018/26.6.2018-fcca-reprimands-riihimaki-and-vaasa-for-failing-to-invite-tenders-for-procurement-contracts/ FCCA reprimands Riihimäki and Vaasa for failing to invite tenders for procurement contracts], published 6 June 2018, accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Market Court operates as a specialist court handling public procurement cases. The Market Court's rulings in public procurement cases can be appealed to the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Finland]].&lt;ref name=Finland /&gt;

The Act on Electronic Auctions and Dynamic Purchasing Systems of 17 June 2011, which entered into force on 1 October 2011, introduced new procurement procedures, whereby documents relating to procurement would be sent and received exclusively online. This legislation included the use of [[Eauction|eAuction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2014-06/eGov%20in%20FI%20-%20May%202014%20-%2016.0.pdf eGovernment in Finland, May 2014], accessed 31 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic procurement is now covered within the 2016 Act on Public Contracts.

Transposition of the 2014 EU public procurement directive into Finnish law was delayed after the deadline (18 April 2016) with the consequence that some aspects of the directive were directly applicable from April 2016 until the new Finnish legislation was in place from 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Merilampi, [http://www.merilampi.com/the-reform-of-the-act-on-public-contracts-the-finnish-legislation-is-delayed/?lang=en The reform of the Act on Public Contracts – the Finnish legislation is delayed], published 28 April 2016, accessed 27 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
In France, the Department of Legal Affairs (DAJ) of the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|Ministry for the Economy and Finance]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Ministère de l'Économie et des Finances'') is responsible for establishing regulations regarding public procurement (''la commande publique''). All currently relevant EU directives have been implemented into national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economie.gouv.fr/daj/commande-publique|title=Commande publique|work=Le portail des ministères économiques et financiers|access-date=2018-06-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
In Germany, the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie'', abbreviated BMWi) is responsible for defining laws and principles regarding public procurement. In 2016 Germany transposed the new EU Directives of 2014 into domestic law. Thereby, processes and contracts in public procurement have become easier and more flexible. The Act against Restraints of Competition - Part IV (German: ''[[:de:Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen|Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen]]'', abbreviated GWB) and the Ordinance on the Award of Public Contracts (German: [[:de:Vergabeverordnung|V''erordnung über die Vergabe öffentlicher Aufträge'']], abbreviated VgV) regulate procurement above EU thresholds. Detailed procedures are specified in further regulations, e.g. the Procurement Regulation for Public Works (German abbreviation: [[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen|VOB]]), the Procurement Regulation for Public Supplies and Services ([[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Leistungen|VOL]]), and the Procurement Regulation for Professional Services ([[:de:Vergabeordnung für freiberufliche Leistungen|VOF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/public-procurement.html|title=Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many contracts electronic procurement is made possible via an [https://www.evergabe-online.de/start.html?0 online platform].

For public procurement below the EU thresholds there are different regulations. At the federal level national budgetary law applies while the 16 federal German states and some municipalities have their own public procurement laws and regulations. This decentralized system reflects the political decentralization in Germany. However, sub-national level procurement regulations often take national regulations as examples and also ensure competition, non-discrimination, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/de.pdf|title=Public Procurement - Germany Country Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
Law 4412/2016 on public procurement and Law 4413/2016 on concessions are the main instruments of [[Greece|Greek]] legislation governing public procurement. These two laws of 2016, along with earlier reforms introduced under Law 4281/2014 on public procurement law, have radically simplified the previously complex legal regime, repealing numerous previous laws.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guides, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/greece Public Procurement 2018: Greece], published 26 January 2018, accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission's profile for [[Greece]] in its study of administrative capacity in the EU had described the public procurement system in the country as "singularly complex, ... being dispersed among as many as 400 laws, regulations, and presidential decrees".&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/el.pdf Public procurement – Study on administrative capacity in the EU: Greece Country Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Public contract notices are published in the Central Electronic Registry for Public Procurement (KIMDIS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/WorkingGroups/workinggroup4/2016-August-22-24/Contributions_NV/Greece_EN.pdf Hellenic Single Public Procurement Authority], accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Procurement Monitoring Unit (PPMU), established in 1997, part of the Centre of International and European Economic Law in [[Thessaloniki]], provides Greek contracting authorities with "specialised and prompt legal advisory support on awarding public works and technical services contracts falling within the scope of EU Law on Public Procurement".&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mopadis.cieel.gr/index.jsp?extLang=LG Public Procurement Monitoring Unit: Welcome], accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Public Procurement Authority was established by Act XL of 1995 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/english/ Public Procurement Authority of Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the current Public Procurement Act (Act CXLIII of 2015) entered into force on November 1, 2015, implementing the 2014 EU procurement directives.&lt;ref name=cxliii&gt;[https://www.procurementinet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Public-Procurement-Act-Hungary.pdf Act CXLIII of 2015 on Public Procurement], accessed 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the 2015 legislation are:
*to secure transparency and public control of the effective use of public funds;
*to establish conditions of fair competition in public procurement;
*to enhance the access of local small and medium-sized enterprises to procurement procedures; and
*to promote environmental protection and the social considerations of the State.&lt;ref name=cxliii /&gt;
Concession award procedures are also covered within the same legislation, and the fundamental principles set out in Act V of 2013 on the [[Civil Code]], the "ultimate instrument relating to the operation of civil persons and economic organizations", also apply to public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Borsy Association of Lawyers, [http://borsyugyveditarsulas.hu/en/magyar-az-uj-polgari-torvenykonyvrol/ The New Civil Code of Hungary], accessed 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
Public procurement in [[Italy]] is primarily regulated by the Public Contracts Code, which is administered by the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (Italy)|Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: Ministero delle infrastrutture e dei trasporti). The code was reformed in 2016 to implement the new EU directives of 2014 into domestic Italian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mit.gov.it/en/comunicazione/news/new-public-procurement-and-concession-contracts-code-has-entered-force|title=The new Public Procurement and Concession Contracts Code has entered into force {{!}} mit|last=|first=|date=2016-04-15|website=www.mit.gov.it|publisher=Italian Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the code, guidelines from the [[National Anti-Corruption Authority (Italy)|National Anti-Corruption Authority]] (Italian: ''Autorità Nazionale AntiCorruzione,'' abbreviated ANAC) and decrees from various ministries also apply to public procurement. Most public procurement on a national level is administered by the state-owned company [[Consip|Consip S.p.A.]] Larger regions have their own agencies for public purchasing.

The five regions with special autonomy ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]], [[Aosta Valley|Valle d’Aosta]]) can also establish regional legislation regarding public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/it.pdf|title=Public procurement - Italy Country Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latvia====
Government procurement in [[Latvia]] is regulated by the Public Procurement Law, effective 1 March 2017, and the Law on the Procurement of Public Service Providers, which came into effect on 1 April 2017. These laws transpose the EU procurement directives; one additional legal provision is that for supplier selection purposes, [[real estate]] tax debts are checked where tenderers are registered or permanently resident in Latvia.

====Luxembourg====
In [[Luxembourg]], the main policy body for public procurement is the Public Procurement Directorate within the Public Works Department of the
[[Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure]] (MDDI). This department is responsible for the regulatory framework, drafting relevant
legislation and monitoring its implementation, and also for representing the Luxemburgish authorities in the field of public procurement. A Tender Commission with members drawn from contracting authorities, chambers of commerce and small business sectors undertakes a consultative role in relation to public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/lu.pdf Public procurement – Study on administrative capacity in the EU: Luxembourg Country Profile], accessed 4 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Review Panel at National Level is under the supervision of the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning whereas the Independent Review Panel at District Level is under the supervision of the District Council.

In order to make the procurement sector a profession in Rwanda, there is an Association of Procurement Professionals which was established by the Law N°011/2016 of 02/05/2016.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°21 of 23/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda introduced an e-procurement system in 2016. For more information about Rwanda's e-procurement system please visit [http://www.umucyo.gov.rw www.umucyo.gov.rw]; for more information about public procurement in Rwanda in general, please visit [http://www.rppa.gov.rw www.rppa.gov.rw].

'''Halvor Bache Guldahl''' (18 March 1859 – 10 October 1931) was a Norwegian jurist, businessman and [[List of County Governors of Nord-Trøndelag|County Governor of Nord-Trøndelag]].

He was born in the village of [[Beitstad]] in [[Nord-Trøndelag]], Norway. &lt;ref name=steinkjer&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.steinkjerleksikonet.no/index.php?artikkel=281|title=Guldahl, Halvor Bachke|editor=Stene, Morten|encyclopedia=Steinkjerleksikonet|location=Steinkjer|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in law, he worked at [[Inderøy District Court]]. He then started as a solicitor in [[Steinkjer]]. He was co-founder of [[Innherreds Kreditbank]] in 1887,&lt;ref name=steinkjer/&gt; and was the first bank director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.steinkjerleksikonet.no/index.php?artikkel=1285|title=Indherreds Kreditbank|editor=Stene, Morten|encyclopedia=Steinkjerleksikonet|location=Steinkjer|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1894 to 1902, he managed  [[Ogndalsbruket]], an operating company for forestry and related resources in the municipal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://steinkjerleksikonet.no/index.php?artikkel=1495|title=Ogndalsbruket|publisher = steinkjerleksikonet.no|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32587">The '''illegal drug trade in China''' is influenced by factors such as history, location, size, population, and current economic conditions. China has one-fifth of the world's population and a large and expanding economy while [[Opium]] has played an important role in the country's history since before the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s in the mid-19th century. China's large land mass, close proximity to the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], [[Golden Crescent]], and numerous coastal cities with large and modern port facilities make it an attractive transit center for drug traffickers.

China's status in drug trafficking has changed significantly since the 1980s, when the country for the first time opened its borders to trade and tourism after 40 years of relative [[Isolationism|isolation]]. As trade with Southeast Asia and elsewhere increased, so did the flow of illicit drugs and [[precursor chemical]]s from, into, and through China.

==Overview==
China is a major source of [[precursor chemical]]s necessary for the production of [[cocaine]], heroin, [[MDMA]] and [[crystal methamphetamine]], which are used by many Southeast Asian and [[Pacific Rim]] nations. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of [[acetic anhydride]] each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. Reports indicate that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to [[morphine]] and heroin refineries in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} China is also a leading exporter of bulk [[ephedrine]] and has been a source country for much of the ephedrine and [[pseudoephedrine]] imported into Mexico; these precursor chemicals are subsequently used to manufacture [[methamphetamine]] destined for the United States. China is developing a significant MDMA production, trafficking, and consumption problem. Although China has taken actions through legislation and regulation of production and exportation of precursor chemicals, extensive action is required to control the illicit diversion and smuggling of precursor chemicals.

China not only continues to be a major transit route for Southeast Asian heroin bound for international drug markets, but also for Southwest Asian heroin entering northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. A majority of the Southeast Asian heroin that enters China from Burma transits southern China to various international markets by maritime transport. Drug traffickers take advantage of expanding port facilities in coastal cities, such as [[Qingdao]], Shanghai, [[Tianjin]], and [[Guangdong]], to ship heroin along maritime routes. Southwest Asian heroin (mainly from Afghanistan) represents as much as 22 percent of the heroin entering northwest China. Chinese authorities believe that these trends will increase and they attribute these increases to the continuing development of the infrastructure and economy in China. China is being forced to develop a complex counter-drug strategy that includes prevention, education, eradication, interdiction, and rehabilitation.

==Cultivation and processing==

===Cannabis===
The Dutch historian [[Frank Dikötter]] describes [[cannabis]], which failed to become part of narcotic culture in modern China, as "China's non-problem", despite having been widely grown and known as a medicinal herb for nearly 2,000 years.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[During the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican period]] (1912-1937)], government authorities claimed that smoking cannabis could cause nervous dysfunction and madness. Such official attitudes must have reflected popular beliefs, since very little concrete evidence exists concerning the use of cannabis even in the large coastal metropoles. In Shanghai not a single case of cannabis use was discovered during the 1930s. With the exception of the Uyghurs, the popular perception of the smell of smoked cannabis as 'foul' (''chou'') also impeded its spread. On the other hand, the extraction of hemp oil was widespread in Shanxi, Mongolia and Manchuria. Although most of it appears to have been used for lighting and to lubricate cart wheels, its narcotic powers may have been understood by the local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank, Lars Laamann, and Zhou Xun (2004), '' Narcotic Culture: A History of Drugs in China'', University Of Chicago Press, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cannabis grows naturally throughout southwestern China, and is legally cultivated in some areas of China for use in commercial [[rope]] manufacturing. Most of the illicit cultivation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis as a drug]] in China appears in [[Xinjiang]] and [[Yunnan]] and is primarily cultivated for domestic use. In 2002, approximately 1.3 metric tons of cannabis were seized in China.

===Ephedra===
The [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] owns and operates [[ephedra]] farms, where ephedra grass (''[[ephedra sinica]]'') is cultivated under strict government control. The active [[alkaloid]]s, [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]], are chemically extracted from the plant material and processed for pharmaceutical purposes. These chemicals are then sold domestically and for export. China and India are the major producers of these chemicals extracted from the ephedra plant. In addition to government-controlled farms, the ephedra plant grows wildly in many parts of the [[North China|northern areas]] of China.

===Opium===
{{hatnote|For the history of opium use within China and the Chinese diaspora, see [[History of opium in China]] and [[Opium den]].}}
Illicit cultivation of the [[opium poppy]] in China is negligible in provinces such as [[Yunnan]], Ningxia, [[Inner Mongolia]], and the remote regions of the northwest frontier. [[Opium]] produced in these areas is not converted into heroin, but is consumed locally by [[ethnic minority]] groups in these isolated areas. Chinese officials report that in the last several years{{when|date=March 2014}} no [[Clandestine chemistry|heroin laboratories]] have been seized in China.

Legal cultivation of the opium poppy occurs on farms controlled by the [[Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Agriculture]] and the National Drug Administration Bureau of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. According to United Nations (U.N.) [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) data, China produces approximately {{convert|14|MT|lb}} of legal opium per year for use in the domestic [[Pharmaceutical industry in China|pharmaceutical industry]]. China reports that none of this opium is exported.

The [[Mao Zedong]] government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform.{{Citation needed| reason=who conducted a survey that concludes "generally credited"?| date=August 2013}} Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] region.&lt;ref name="McCoy opium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/opi010.htm |title=Opium History, 1858 to 1940 |author=Alfred W. McCoy |accessdate=May 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404134938/http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/opi010.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]], with 20 percent of soldiers regarding themselves as addicted during the peak of the epidemic in 1971. In 2003, China was estimated to have four million regular drug users and one million registered drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD29Ad01.html|title=Banned in China for sex, drugs, disaffection|author=Michael Mackey|date=April 29, 2004|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic drugs===
Manufacture of [[crystal methamphetamine]] (''ice'', ''shabu'', ''bingdu'') is facilitated by the availability of [[precursor chemical]]s, such as [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]]. The unrestricted availability of these chemicals in the country facilitates the production of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine. Seizure information indicates that methamphetamine laboratories are located in provinces along the eastern and southeastern coastal areas. Many of the traffickers for the clandestine crystal methamphetamine laboratories are from [[organized crime]] groups based in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan.

Because of its increasing popularity with young party goers in Beijing, Shanghai, [[Nanjing]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]], Chinese [[Law enforcement in China|law enforcement]] officials report significant increases in the domestic production of [[MDMA]] (''Ecstasy''). Most MDMA production in China is for domestic consumption.  MDMA tablets are also imported from the Netherlands into China to meet the demand.

Some laboratory operators in China mix MDMA powder, imported from Europe, with substances, such as [[caffeine]] and [[ketamine]], while making the Ecstasy tablets. Given the availability of the precursor chemicals needed, [[open source]] reporting in 2006 indicates that MDMA tablets in China cost only US$0.06 to produce, while the tablets sell for as much as US$36 in the city of Shanghai.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Trafficking groups===
Many of the individuals involved in the international trafficking of Southeast Asian heroin are ethnic [[Kokang]], [[Yunnanese]], [[Fujianese people|Fujianese]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], or members of other [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] minority groups that reside outside of China. These groups reside, and are actively involved in drug trafficking in regions such as Burma, Cambodia, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.

Reporting on the activities of drug trafficking organizations in China is sparse. However, Chinese officials report that drug traffickers are dividing their large shipments into smaller ones in order to minimize losses in case of seizure. Chinese officials also report that drug traffickers are increasingly using women, children, and poor, uneducated farmers to body-carry drugs from the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] area to [[Guangdong]] and other provinces in China.

In China many individuals and criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking are increasingly arming themselves with [[automatic weapon]]s and [[grenade]]s to protect their drug shipments from theft by rival organizations. Many firefights occur along the Burma–China border, where larger drug shipments are more prevalent. Traffickers also arm themselves to avoid being captured by the police, and some smugglers are better armed than the local police forces. Furthermore, many traffickers believe they have a better chance of surviving a firefight than the outcome of any legal proceedings. In China, sentencing for drug trafficking could include capital punishment. For example, the seizure of 50&amp;nbsp;grams or more of heroin or crystal methamphetamine could result in the use of the death penalty by the Government.

===Heroin===
[[Image:China pol01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|China's borders (click to enlarge)]]
China shares a 2000&amp;nbsp;km border with Burma, as well as smaller but significant borders with Laos and Vietnam. Chinese officials state that the majority of heroin entering China comes over the border from Burma. This heroin then transits southern China, through [[Yunnan]] or [[Guangxi]], to [[Guangdong]] or [[Fujian]] to the southeastern coastal areas, and then on to international markets. Heroin is transported by various overland methods to ports in China's southeastern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian.

Heroin is transported to Guangdong and to the cities of [[Xiamen]] and [[Fuzhou]] in Fujian for shipment to international drug markets. Traffickers take advantage of expanding port facilities in northeast cities, such as [[Qingdao]], Shanghai, and [[Tianjin]], to ship heroin via maritime routes. Increased Chinese [[interdiction]] efforts along the Burma–China border have forced some traffickers to send heroin from Burma to China's southeastern provinces by [[Commercial trawler|fishing trawler]]s.

In addition to Southeast Asian heroin entering into China, Southwest Asian heroin enters northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Chinese authorities state that Southwest Asian heroin (mainly originating from Afghanistan) represents as much as 20 percent of the heroin that enters the northwest [[Xinjiang]]. This trend is increasing, and is attributed to the continuing development of the infrastructure and economy in the [[West China|western parts]] of China.

===Synthetic drugs===
Due to the availability of the [[precursor chemical]]s, traffickers produce large amounts of [[crystal methamphetamine]]. Although much of the crystal methamphetamine is consumed locally, some is available for shipment to other markets throughout Southeast Asia. Several ports in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] serve as transit points for crystal methamphetamine transported by [[containerized cargo]] to international drug markets.

Some MDMA traffickers in China are linked directly to the United States. In June 2001, tablets from seizures in two [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] San Francisco investigations were linked to the same source as a 300,000-tablet seizure in [[Shenzhen]], China that had occurred days before. Although the San Francisco seizures were much smaller than the Shenzhen seizure, the capabilities of these trafficking groups appear to be significant. Chinese officials seized over 3 million Ecstasy tablets in China in 2002.

===Precursor chemicals===
China is of paramount importance in global cooperative efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals. With its large [[chemical industry]], China remains a source country for legitimately produced chemicals that are diverted for production of heroin and [[cocaine]], as well as many [[amphetamine]]-type [[stimulant]]s. China and its neighbor India are the leading exporters of [[Bulk cargo|bulk]] [[ephedrine]] in the world. China produces over 100,000 [[metric ton]]s of [[acetic anhydride]] each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. China is also the second largest producer of [[potassium permanganate]] in the world.

To combat the diversion of precursor chemicals, China implemented several regulations on the control of precursor chemicals between 1992 and 1998, including adoption of the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances|U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] in 1993. Additionally, the Government further improved regulations to strengthen control of [[ephedrine]] during 1999 and 2000.

China fully participates in the DEA's Operations TOPAZ and PURPLE, which are international monitoring initiatives that target [[acetic anhydride]] and [[potassium permanganate]], respectively. Acetic anhydride is used to synthesize [[morphine]] base into heroin, and potassium permanganate is used as an [[oxidizer]] in cocaine production. Both chemicals are targeted because they are the chemicals most often preferred, and most widely used, by illicit drug manufacturers. However, the effectiveness of Operation PURPLE has been declining recently, since participant nations are exporting significant amounts of potassium permanganate to non-participant countries.

Additionally, Chinese authorities further control the export of [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] through the voluntary use of the [[Letter of Non-Objection]] (LONO) system. China will not allow exports of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine without a positive affirmation by authorities in the importing country as to the [[bona fide]]s of the consignee. For those countries that do not issue import permits, a letter of non-objection must be provided to Chinese authorities.

China is a source country for significant amounts of the [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] exported to Mexico, and subsequently used to manufacture [[methamphetamine]] destined for the United States.

Increases in pseudoephedrine diversion were noted, beginning with the seizures in March and April 2003 of four shipments of product destined for Mexico. The seizures occurred in the United States and Panama, and totaled over 22 million, 60-milligram pseudoephedrine tablets. The source of supply has been identified as legitimate [[pharmaceutical companies]] in Hong Kong. Additional investigations have revealed other companies in Hong Kong that have been engaged in supplying substantial amounts of pseudoephedrine to firms, sometime fictitious, shells or fronts, in Mexico.

Also, reports indicate that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to morphine/heroin [[refineries]] found in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. Domestically, Chinese officials express concern over the increasing number of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic drug]] production operations in their country. Seizures of precursor chemicals in China increased from 50 metric tons in 1991 to 383 metric tons in 1997; only 300 metric tons were seized in 2002.

==Drug-related money laundering==
In the past [[money laundering]] was not considered a significant problem in China. However, with the booming economy promoting greater trade investment and the ever-increasing number of foreign bank branches opening throughout the country, it appears that China may become an emerging money laundering center.

China, however, has taken some initial steps to begin investigation of money laundering activities. An Economic Crimes Investigation Department was established in the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] to focus on illicit activities. The [[People's Bank of China]] (China's central bank) began several structural reforms such as the establishment of two new divisions, the Payment Trade Supervisory Division and the Money Laundering Working Division. The People's Bank of China also prepared guidelines for use by financial institutions to report suspicious [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s, and to sensitize the public about new regulations on money laundering and [[terrorist financing]] issues.

The major drugs of choice are injectable heroin, [[morphine]], smokeable [[opium]], [[crystal methamphetamine]], [[nimetazepam]], [[temazepam]], and [[MDMA]]. Preferences between opium and heroin/morphine, and methods of administration, differ from region to region within China. The use of heroin and opium has increased among the younger population, as income has grown and the youth have more free time. China considers crystal methamphetamine abuse second to heroin/morphine as a major drug problem. The use of MDMA has only recently become popular in China's growing urban areas.

The ''South China Morning Post'' reports the rise in the use of ketamine, easy to mass-produce in illicit labs in southern China, particularly among the young. Because of its low cost, and low profit margin, drug peddlers rely on mass distribution to make money, thus increasing its penetrative power to all, including schoolchildren. The journal cites social workers saying that four people can get high by sharing just HK$20 worth of ketamine, and estimates 80 per cent of young drug addicts take 'K'.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung, Philip (9 April 2010), We have a way; where's the will to tackle drugs?, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addict population===
As of 2013, there were 2,475,000 registered  [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] in China, 1,326,000 of which where addicted to heroin, accounting for 53.6% of the addict population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Peoples-War-final.pdf|title=A People’s War: China’s Struggle to Contain its Illicit Drug Problem|last=|first=|date=|website=Brookings|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unofficial estimates range as high as 12 million drug addicts. Of the registered drug addicts, 83.7 percent are male and 73.9 percent are under the age of 35. 

In 2001, intravenous heroin users accounted for 70.9 percent of the confirmed 22,000 [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) cases. Chinese officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the abuse of [[methamphetamine]] and other [[amphetamine]]-type [[stimulant]]s.

===Treatment and demand reduction programs===
Both voluntary and compulsory [[Drug rehabilitation|drug treatment]] programs are provided in China, although the compulsory treatment is more common. Most addicts who attend these centers do so involuntarily upon orders from the Government. Voluntary treatment is provided at centers operated by [[Public Health]] Bureaus, but these programs are more expensive and many people cannot afford to attend them. Addicts, who return to drug use after having received treatment, and who cannot be cured by other means, may be sentenced to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] at any one of the special centers for [[re-education through labor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These centers are run under conditions similar to prisons, including isolation from the outside world, restricted patient movement and a paramilitary routine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Demand reduction efforts target individuals between the ages of 17 and 35, since this is the largest segment of drug users. These efforts include, but are not limited to, media campaigns and establishment of drug-free communities.

==Drug law enforcement agencies and legislation==
At the national level, the agencies specifically responsible for the control of legal and illicit drugs are the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]], and the [[Customs General Administration]]. The [[State Food and Drug Administration]] oversees implementation of the laws regulating the [[Pharmaceutical industry in China|pharmaceutical industry]]. In the Customs General Administration, the Smuggling Prevention Department plays the major role in intercepting illegal drug shipments. The Narcotics Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security handles all criminal investigations involving [[opium]], heroin, and [[methamphetamine]].

In 1990, the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] set up the {{ill|National Narcotics Control Commission|zh|国家禁毒委员会}} (NNCC), composed of 25 departments, including the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Health and General Administration of Customs. The NNCC leads the nation's drug control work in a unified way, and is responsible for international drug control cooperation, with an operational agency based in the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/mzpkz/t36387.htm|title=Narcotics Control in China|website=www.china-embassy.org|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties and conventions==
China is a party to the 1988 U.N. [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances|Drug Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VI-19&amp;chapter=6&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1961 U.N. [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] as amended by the 1972 Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VI-15&amp;chapter=6&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1971 U.N. [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf|title=CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES , 1971|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is a member of the [[International Criminal Police Organization]] (INTERPOL), and has been a member of the [[International Narcotics Control Board|INCB]] since 1984.

China also participates in a drug control program with Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, and the United States. This program is designed to enhance information sharing and coordination of drug law enforcement activities by countries in and around the Central Asian Region.

In June 2000, China and the United States signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAT). This treaty subsequently went into effect on March 8, 2001. In 1999, China and the United States signed a Bilateral Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement. However, this agreement has not yet been activated. A May 1997 United States and China [[Memorandum of Understanding]] on law enforcement cooperation allows the two countries to provide assistance on drug investigations and prosecutions on a case-by-case basis.

China has over 30 MLATs with 24 nations covering both civil and criminal matters. In 1996, China signed MLATs that gave specific attention to drug trafficking with Russia, Mexico, and Pakistan. China also signed a drug control cooperation agreement with India.

China and Burma continue dialogue on counter-drug issues, such as drug trafficking by the [[United Wa State Army]] along the China–Burma border. The Government of China encourages and provides assistance for alternative crop programs in Burma along the China–Burma border. China is also building on Memoranda of Understanding that are currently in place with Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].

[[File:ISM Manufacturing index.png|frameless|right|400px|ISM Manufacturing Index chart]]

'''Institute for Supply Management''' ('''ISM''') is the oldest, and the largest, supply management association in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/arizona/institute-for-supply-management-ism-tempe ISM Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1915, the U.S.-based [[not-for-profit]] educational association serves professionals and organizations with a keen interest in supply management, providing them education, training, qualifications, publications, information, and research.

ISM currently has 50,000 members in more than 90 countries. It offers two qualifications, the [[Certified Professional in Supply Management]] (CPSM) and the [[Supplier diversity|Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity]] (CPSD), and, in partnership with the [[W.P. Carey School of Business]] at [[Arizona State University]], sponsors '''CAPS Research'''.

ISM competes against several educational, certification, and membership organizations serving the supply chain profession, including [[APICS]], the Next Level Purchasing Association, the National Contract Management Association, the American Purchasing Society, The Center for Purchasing and Supply Chain Management Excellence, and the [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]].

==History==
Institute for Supply Management originated in 1915 as the ''National Association of Purchasing Agents'' ('''N.A.P.A.''').

In the early twentieth century, purchasing and the function that it served and represented did not enjoy the full support of management, which was typically indifferent to it or unaware of its potential. Prior to 1915, local purchasing associations had formed in at least 10 major cities in the U.S., including one of the most active groups in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (founded in 1904). There was a realization among some purchasers that they needed a national group to advance their profession and share useful information among members, but support was spotty. There was a certain level of distrust organizers had to overcome as buyers were practically strangers to each other and feared that their participation would reveal information that could benefit rival companies. As Charles A. Steele, president of N.A.P.A. stated in 1923:
:: ...it had been a sort of unwritten rule that purchasers were one body of men who should not communicate with each other for fear that they might do the other fellow some good and themselves some harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Paul V.|date=1954|title=''50 Years of Purchasing: The Story of N.A.P.A''|location=New York|publisher=Shipman Medalists, National Association of Purchasing Agents|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, it was not a purchasing agent but a salesman working for the [[Thomasnet|Thomas Publishing Company]] by the name of Elwood B. Hendricks who realized the full potential of the buying function and was the driving force behind forming a national purchasing association. In 1913, Hendricks's plan began to bear fruit when he helped form the Purchasing Agents Association of New York that was to become the nucleus of the national organization. The New York group applied for and received a charter  for N.A.P.A. in 1915. The first local groups to affiliate with the new national association were [[New York City]] and [[Pittsburgh]] in 1915 and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] in 1916. [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]] and [[Los Angeles]] followed them in 1917. Buffalo later affiliated with N.A.P.A. in 1918 and by 1920 there were over 30 affiliates and that number continued to skyrocket. Hendricks efforts were so instrumental in the organization's success that it gave him an honorary lifetime membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Paul V.|date=1954|title=''50 Years of Purchasing: The Story of N.A.P.A''|location=New York|publisher=Shipman Medalists, National Association of Purchasing Agents|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of N.A.P.A. were to:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impress the business world with the importance of the purchasing function to economic well-being;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourage purchasing people to improve themselves and make greater contributions to the companies they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Paul V.|date=1991|title=''NAPM: The First 75 Years''|publisher=National Association of Purchasing Management, Inc|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The new national association was three affiliates strong when it held its first convention in New York in 1916 with 100 of its 250 members in attendance. That year also saw N.A.P.A. launch a magazine, ''The Purchasing Agent'', that was to have an immense impact on the success of the organization and eventually evolve into the association's current ''Inside Supply Management'' magazine. In 1918, approximately one thousand members were expected to attend that year's national convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McGrew |first=E.L. |date=July 1918 |magazine= The Purchaser |location= New York|publisher= N.A.P.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new association gathered steam and soon began to make its presence felt on the national stage. Within five years, N.A.P.A. membership had soared and it had 32 affiliates and many more would join over the coming decades.

===World War I and the 1920s===
With the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, N.A.P.A. offered its services to President Wilson to aid in the buying of materials. With the industrial war effort in high gear, materials were scarcer and procurement had become more complicated as the U.S. government "attempted to guide economic activity via centralized price and production controls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of World War I|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/jan05/w10580.html|website=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time of opportunity that allowed purchasing to prove itself.
Purchasing agents nationwide began to exert themselves as departments in their plants that typically claimed purchasing rights were now too busy to interfere in procurement and purchasing agents proved to management they could help keep production up.
 
It was also during this time that N.A.P.A. members helped establish purchasing courses at New York University and Harvard. It was a small step, but the first seeds of N.A.P.A.’s renowned purchasing education program had been planted. The association was also deep in standards work and discussing a code of ethics for the purchasing profession.

During the 1920s, it became clear to businesses the centralization of purchasing was not a fad. N.A.P.A.'s efforts to promote the field bore fruit and 
the business world began to view purchasing in a more favorable light.
 
During World War I, N.A.P.A. called for the centralization of War Department purchasing to reduce inefficiency and graft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date= February 1918|title= Editorial  |magazine= The Purchaser |location= New York|publisher= The Purchasing Agent Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association began to flex its muscle and demanded standardization in the purchase and use of coal and the prosecution of profiteers. Its crusade for ethical standards resulted in the ''Purchasing Agent’s Creed'' that observers hailed for decades as one of the outstanding moral statements in modern business. In 1928, it released the ''Standards for Buying and Selling'' with the recognition that buying and selling should be mutually profitable and that cooperation would reduce the cost of purchasing.

===The Great Depression and World War II===
During the 1930s, N.A.P.A. undertook an intensive effort to improve education and develop standards. The Harvard Business School published two purchasing textbooks and it developed case studies about purchasing problems, all under the auspices of N.A.P.A. The association also commissioned a highly regarded authoritative two-volume work on purchasing practices and procedures.

In 1931, the association continued its push toward excellence, when it established the J. Shipman Gold Medal Award, the highest honor in the field, bestowed on an individual for exceptional performance who advanced the cause of supply management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM Names Bradley Holcomb 2015 Shipman Award Winner|url=http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/ISM+Names+Bradley+Holcomb+2015+Shipman+Award+Winner/10525321.html|website=StreetInsider.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Great Depression gripped the world, N.A.P.A. created its Business Survey Committee in 1931 and began polling members on commodities. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using these reports when compiling information for the federal government. These reports would eventually evolve into the association’s market-moving report now known as the [[ISM Report On Business]] a highly regarded indicator of the health of the U.S. economy.

When World War II broke out, N.A.P.A. again rose to Washington’s call for assistance and kept its members routinely updated on government requirements and regulations during wartime production. As the government placed controls on producers and consumers, many of N.A.P.A.’s members played a critical role in the process.

With the return to a peacetime free market, purchasing executives faced new complexities with higher costs and increased shortages requiring innovative techniques. Again, N.A.P.A. led the way by making its educational content even more robust and wide-ranging.

===N.A.P.A rebranded as NAPM===

By the 1950s, N.A.P.A.’s prestige had grown along with the function that it served. Membership during this period hit 15,000. N.A.P.A. intensified its efforts to develop a new image for the purchasing profession in the eyes of the public, educators, management and purchasing executives. As companies battled ever more fiercely for a better return on their investment and greater market share, they eventually came to the realization that purchasing was spending, on average, one-half of corporate sales income, and began demanding that purchasing make positive contributions to attaining corporate goals.

In the eyes of U.S. companies, purchasing was no longer acting as a mere agent—it had been transformed into a vital management function. To accurately reflect this fundamental shift in purchasing's role, in 1968, N.A.P.A. changed its name to the '''National Association of Purchasing Management, Inc.''' ('''NAPM''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Paul V.|date=1991|title=''NAPM: The First 75 Years''|publisher=National Association of Purchasing Management, Inc|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1966, NAPM’s leadership recognized the importance of developing a national certification program to create a standard on which to judge a competent purchaser. After careful groundwork, in 1974, NAPM introduced the Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M) qualification, the first professional certification in the field.

The association continued its educational efforts and in 1976 conducted its first ever onsite plant training. NAPM was cognizant of the profound social changes the country had been undergoing and became involved in minority and women’s initiatives and even elected May Warzocha as its first woman president in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Years of Learning. 100 Years of Leading|url=http://www.ismmagazine-digital.com/ismmagazine/january_february_2015?pg=20#pg20|website=ismmagazine|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, it formed the Minority Business Development Group to assist members with their minority supplier programs.

The Report On Business continued to gain recognition as the most reliable near-term economic barometer available. In 1982, NAPM introduced the Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) and in 1988 it added diffusion indexes and introduced a graph format. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce began including NAPM’s data as a component of its Index of Leading Indicators and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve praised the Report. In 1998, the association added to the value of the Report when it developed the Non-Manufacturing Report On Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM Non-Manufacturing Index|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-nonmfg.asp|website=Investopedia | accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformation to ISM===
As the field grew in complexity and became more global, purchasing professionals were becoming more responsible for the supply of goods and services instead of strictly purchasing. To more accurately reflect the scope that the profession encompassed, NAPM members voted in April 2001 to change the organization's name to Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which became effective in January 2002.

In 2002, ISM launched its sustainability and social responsibility initiative and in 2004 issued its '''ISM Principles of Social Responsibility''', the first of their kind for the supply management profession.

To ensure a strong group of future supply management leaders, in 2005, ISM partnered with the R. Gene and Nancy D. Richter Foundation to expand the '''R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program''' into the largest national scholarship program in the field of supply management. Together, in 2008, they established the ISM R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program Fund with a goal of providing for the funding of scholarships on an ongoing basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. Gene and Nancy D. Richter Foundation Names Newest Trustee|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/415324|website=PR.com | accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accurately address the range of demands required to master supply management, in 2008, ISM introduced a new professional qualification the '''Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)''' to replace the C.P.M. The CPSM represents the highest degree of professional competencies and is built on an in-depth analysis of supply management functions across industries.

In 2011, ISM introduced the '''Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD)''' qualification to create experts who could help guide their companies through supplier diversity issues, harness underutilized, innovative suppliers and tap into new markets. That same year, ISM began its Corporate Program to help the employees of corporate members perform at a higher level.

In an attempt to create a common language for the supply management field, ISM introduced the [[ISM Mastery Model]] in 2015. Covering 16 core competencies and 69 subcompetencies, the model and its assessment tool identify employee skills gaps and solutions to close them. It also allows companies to benchmark team member skills and create a development roadmap and set job expectations.

==Supply Management==

ISM defines [[supply management (procurement)|supply management]] as:

:: ...the identification, analysis, determination, procurement and fulfillment of the goods and services an organization needs to meet short- and long-term objectives. By managing external partners' capabilities and linking them to organizational goals, supply management contributes to the strategic direction of an organization through total cost and capabilities management.

::By effective oversight and engagement of people, processes and relationships, supply management creates competitive advantage through innovation, cost management, quality improvement, asset optimization, risk mitigation, social responsibility and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2015|title=''ISM Glossary of Key Supply Management Terms''|edition=6th |publisher=Institute for Supply Management|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Components included under the supply management umbrella are:

===ISM Mastery Model===

In 2015, ISM announced the release of the [[ISM Mastery Model]] a comprehensive set of competency-based standards of excellence for supply management practitioners, executives and organizations worldwide. One of ISM's goals in developing the Mastery Model was to create a common language for the supply management field that would be viable cross-industry.

== Certification Programs==
===Currently offered certifications===
ISM currently offers two professional qualifications: CPSM and CPSD.

'''Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)'''

In 2008, ISM launched its Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) certification to address the changing demands of the profession and the international marketplace. According to ISM’s 2017 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSM recipient was $118,300.

'''Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD)'''

ISM’s Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD), launched in January 2011, is currently the only certification for professionals whose responsibilities include supplier diversity, and it is supported by various diversity organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. According to ISM’s 2017 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSD recipient was $120,243.

===Previously offered certifications===
Two previous certifications, the C.P.M. and A.P.P., are no longer offered, but holders are eligible for ongoing recertification.

'''Certified Purchasing Manager'''

ISM’s Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) designation was a popular certification through the 1990s. However, it is no longer offered for testing by ISM and has transitioned into recertification-only status.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/certification/content.cfm?ItemNumber=4674&lt;/ref&gt; ISM continues to recertify C.P.M.s who meet continuing education requirements. According to ISM’s 2017 annual salary survey, the average compensation (salary plus bonus) for a Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) was $124,138.

'''Accredited Purchasing Practitioner'''

ISM also offered Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.) designation for several years. The A.P.P. focused on entry-level purchasing functions for those primarily engaged in the operational side of the supply chain. No longer offered for testing, ISM continues to recertify A.P.P.s who meet continuing education requirements. According to ISM’s 2017 annual salary survey, the average salary for an Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.) was $120,396.

==Publications==
'''ISM Report On Business'''

The [[ISM Report On Business]] has its roots in the 1920s when N.A.P.A. began polling its members about commodities. During the Great Depression, N.A.P.A. began supplying economic data to President Hoover and the importance of the report has grown to its present significance. Today, it is considered to be one of the most reliable economic barometers of the U.S. economy and gives an important early look at the health of the nation’s economy. The Report is based on two national surveys of purchasing managers tracking changes in the [[manufacturing]] and non-manufacturing sectors.

'''Inside Supply Management'''

ISM publishes a members-only monthly magazine ''Inside Supply Management'' (formerly titled ''The Purchasing Agent'', ''Purchasing Today'' and ''NAPM Insights''), which debuted in June 1998.

'''PMI'''

ISM releases its [[Purchasing Managers Index|''PMI'']] composite index (formerly known as the ''Purchasing Managers’ Index'') on the first business day of each month. It can be found under ''ISM Reports On Business'' on the ISM home page.

==Education==
ISM offers a comprehensive curriculum addressing all areas of supply, but with a particular focus on sourcing and procurement, available in different formats.
*Online courses
*[[Podcast]]s
*[[Webcast]]s
*[[Web conferencing|Webinars]]

==Products and services==
*CPSM and CPSD professional certifications
*[[ISM Mastery Model]]
*[[ISM Report On Business]]

==Partnerships==
'''CAPS Research'''

CAPS Research is a non-profit research organization jointly sponsored by ISM and the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University dedicated to providing strategic insight to top global organizations. It also uses supply management [[Performance indicator|KPIs]] to provide comprehensive [[benchmarking]] so companies can see how they compare to other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charting the course for strategic supply management|url=http://www.capsresearch.org/about-caps-research/|website=CAPS Research=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spend Matters'''

ISM is partnered with procurement blog ''Spend Matters'' in conducting research and surveys.&lt;ref&gt;http://spendmatters.com/2013/08/15/direct-procurement-improving-procurements-quality-of-influence-in-the-supply-chain/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Source One Management Services'''

Since 2016, the Institute for Supply Management's Annual Conference has featured a private subconference: ExecIn. An extension of the popular event's agenda, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/conferences/content.cfm?ItemNumber=30822&amp;SSO=1&lt;/ref&gt; ExecIn features panel discussions, keynote speeches, and private sessions hosted by the conference's featured speakers. Past featured speakers include [[David Cameron]] and [[Colin Powell]]. The event is sponsored by Pennsylvania-based Procurement Services Provider Source One Management Services.

==Principles and standards==
ISM publishes principles of sustainability and social responsibility as well as principles and standards of ethical supply management conduct. Its goal in doing so is to give its members firm guidelines and solutions to help them navigate a complex global environment and problematic business conditions.

==Controversies==
In 2013, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] investigated the early release of the June 2013 Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business'' by mass media and information firm [[Thomson Reuters]]. According to an article on [[CNBC|cnbc.com]], there was an upsurge of [[High-frequency trading|high-speed trading]] 15 milliseconds before the report was scheduled to be released: 

:: ...ISM's manufacturing data was inadvertently sent out early by Thomson Reuters on June 3rd to its high-speed clients, many of whom immediately traded on the information. There was a sharp market reaction to that burst of trading, which prompted downward moves in the [[SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF|SPY ETF]], which serves as an investing tool for traders to bet on the overall direction of the market. That downward surge [allowed insiders] more than enough time to profit from early knowledge of market-moving information.&lt;ref name="Javers cnbc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Javors|first1=Eamon|title=SEC Investigating Early Release of Reuters, ISM Data|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100850196|website=CNBC|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a telephone inquiry from the SEC about the early release of the data, Thomson Reuters issued a statement explaining that the early release was due to a clock synchronization issue. At the SEC’s request, the firm voluntarily provided a redacted copy of its contract with ISM. In an interview with CNBC, ISM CEO Thomas Derry said that after speaking with Thomson Reuters about the mechanics of their release process, he was confident it was an isolated occurrence. He also indicated that “We have not been contacted by any government entity.”&lt;ref name="Javers cnbc"/&gt;

On June 2, 2014, ISM released the [[ISM Report On Business|ISM ''Report On Business'']], its closely followed monthly manufacturing report, and then revised it twice in the span of about two-and-a-half hours, a highly unusual event. The initial figure of 53.2 was lower than anticipated and indicated a slowing of the pace of factory-sector growth, and this caused stocks to dip immediately. Economists quickly queried the accuracy of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM manufacturing data revised after hours of confusion|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/02/ism-may-manufacturing-index-was-incorrect-earlier-correct-figure-560-not-532-report.html|website=CNBC (Reuters)|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISM's final correction of 55.4 was almost in line with [[Wall Street]] expectations, indicating brisk growth, and the stock market rebounded quickly and closed the day with a modest gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kell|first1=John|title=Stocks rise after revised May manufacturing data|url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/02/ism-may-manufacturing/|website=Fortune (magazine)|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, ISM attributed the errant report to a software glitch that "incorrectly used the seasonal adjustment factor from the previous month."

== Early life and education ==
Jon Barela was born and raised in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], and attended Las Cruces High School.  He earned a bachelor's degree in History and Diplomacy from the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.)  in 1984.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;[http://sfs.georgetown.edu/ Georgetown]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from [[Georgetown University]] School of Foreign Service,&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Barela joined the staff of New Mexico Congressman [[Joe Skeen]].  As a senior aide to the Congressman, he focused on the House appropriations and legislative process. While working for Congressman Skeen, Barela earned his law degree from [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonbarela.com/Bio.aspx|title=About Jon|publisher=Jon Barela campaign website|year=2009|accessdate=2010-10-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008021136/http://jonbarela.com/Bio.aspx|archivedate=2010-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Barela returned to New Mexico in 1987 and joined the Modrall law firm in Albuquerque. Four years later, he became New Mexico's Assistant Attorney General and Director of the Civil Division under then Attorney General [[Hal Stratton]].

In 1993, Barela joined [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] as its community and government relations manager. He set company benchmarks for outreach into underrepresented communities and was awarded the Intel Achievement Award, the company's highest and most selective honor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Barela left Intel in 2005.

;Cerelink
After spending most of his career as an attorney and as a state and federal lobbyist, in 2002 Barela decided to become a business owner and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Economic Development Web Site http://www.gonm.biz/About_NMEDD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded Cerelink, a technology start-up firm that specialized in complex computer rendering for visual effects in Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;"Luring Hollywood to Cloud Computing," Michael White, RREDC, Bloomberg News, Cerelink News Release, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to founding Cerelink, Barela had no prior experience in technology development for the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;NMEDD Web Site http://www.gonm.biz/About_NMEDD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 2010 congressional campaign, Barela frequently cited his work at Cerelink when described himself as a successful entrepreneur. In 2011, he was questioned by media outlets on whether Cerelink was the beneficiary of tax credits from state government.&lt;ref name="Ducks"&gt;"Barela Ducks Questions About State Film Rebate Program, New Mexico Independent, October 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, Barela told KKOB-AM that those reports were "erroneous."&lt;ref name="Ducks"/&gt; He told the Albuquerque Journal that his company "never received any tax credits, period. That is just flatly inaccurate it is just wrong."&lt;ref&gt;"Barela Touts His NM Roots, DC Experience," Michael Coleman, ABQ Journal. October 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Albuquerque Journal reported that Cerelink had stopped operations and was bankrupt, leaving the New Mexico Computer Application Center with an outstanding bill of $934,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Hollywood Flop," Kevin Robinson-Avila, "Albuquerque Journal," July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Barela maintains that he had no involvement with Cerelink since 2009, when he resigned from the board and reduced his stake in the company to less than 1 percent of shares.

== Community affairs ==
Barela has made competitiveness and improving education central themes in his chairmanship of several significant organizations, including the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce (one of the country's largest Hispanic chambers), New Mexico First (the state's leading nonpartisan public policy group),
New Mexico's Work Force Development Board, and the [[Albuquerque Public Schools]] Foundation.

Barela challenged Democratic incumbent [[Martin Heinrich]] for {{ushr|NM|1}}, but was ultimately defeated in a 51%-49% race on election night. After the election, he was appointed by Governor [[Susana Martinez]] to serve as secretary of New Mexico's Economic Development Department.

Barela ran unopposed in the primary for [[New Mexico's 1st congressional district]] Republican nomination.&lt;ref name="NM House Candidates" /&gt;

=== Political positions ===
Barela has signed the [[Americans for Tax Reform]] "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", a written promise by legislators and candidates for office that commits them to oppose tax increases.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela Issues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonbarela.com/ISSUES.aspx |title=Issues |publisher=Jon Barela campaign website |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008021234/http://jonbarela.com/ISSUES.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He supports programs to encourage parents' involvement in their children's education, and successful programs which show parents and children the connection between education and future success, such as the [[Young Enterprise#Learn To Earn|"Learn and Earn"]] program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} He cites his experience in the community working on behalf of educational programs as indication that he knows what works and what does not. In regard to the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], Barela prefers removing legislative and regulatory barriers to providing insurance, such as allowing interstate pooling for insurance purchase, rather than further government intervention in the health care system.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela Issues" /&gt;

Barela has received the highest rating from the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrapvf.org/upcoming-elections/New-Mexico.aspx |title=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund: New Mexico |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009093508/http://www.nrapvf.org/upcoming-elections/New-Mexico.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gun Owners of America]] also gave him their highest rating and their endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031142902/http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Leonardo Del Vecchio was born in 1935 in [[Milan]], Italy, to an impoverished family from [[Barletta]], [[Southern Italy]]. He began his career as an apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to make spectacle parts. So in 1961 he moved to [[Agordo]] in the [[province of Belluno]], which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry.&lt;ref name="Grdn2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knight |first1=Sam |title=The spectacular power of Big Lens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica |accessdate=3 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership. In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, and in 1971 he entered the contract manufacturing business.

In 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company. In 1981 the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany. A licensing deal with the designer Giorgio Armani was settled in 1988.

The company listed in New York in 1990, and in Milan in December 2000, joining the MIB-30 (now S&amp;P/MIB) index in September 2003. The listing enhanced the company’s ability to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue in 1990, [[Persol]] and US Shoe Corporation ([[LensCrafters]]) in 1995, [[Ray-Ban]] in 1999 and [[Sunglass Hut]], Inc. in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/02/22/deals/sunglasshut/|title=Luxottica to buy Sunglass Hut for $462M - Feb. 22, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went looking for more retail companies, acquiring Sydney-based [[OPSM]] in 2003, [[Pearle Vision]] in 2004, Surfeyes in 2006, and Cole National in 2004. Most recently, they acquired [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] in a US$2.1bn deal in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/21/luxottica-oakley-update-markets-equity-cx_vr_0621markets21|title=Luxottica's Shade-less Deal With Oakley|last=Ram|first=Vidya|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4813">'''Mobile file management''' (MFM) is a type of [[information technology]] (IT) software that allows businesses to manage transfers and storage of corporate files and other related items on a [[mobile device]], and allows the business to oversee user access.  Mobile file management software is typically installed on a corporate [[file server]] like [[Windows 2008]], and on a [[mobile device]] such as  [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, e.g., [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], etc.  Other features include the ability to remotely wipe a lost or stolen device, access, cache and store files on a mobile device and integrate with [[filesystem permissions|file permission solutions]] like those from [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]].&lt;ref name=GroupLogic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/ |title=iPad File System: Mobile File Management |work=GroupLogic |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809091958/http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/# |archive-date=2011-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html |title=Apple iPad Corporate Security Gets Boost from GroupLogic |author=Greene, Tim |date=23 May 2011 |work=Network World |publisher=International Data Group (IDG) |access-date=2011-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142923/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html# |archive-date=2011-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main advantage of modern mobile file management solutions is that they do not need a VPN connection for the mobile devices to connect to the corporate file servers. The connection between the mobile device and the corporate file server is established via a cloud service. This way the corporate [[file server]] doesn't need to open incoming ports which would cause security issues. The files are transferred highly encrypted{{snd}} e.g. according to AES 256-bit industry standard. Only the company server and the mobile device keep the encryption key to be able to encrypt and decrypt the files. So nobody, not even the mobile file management solution provider, can access the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep your documents under your control|url=http://www.file-spirit.com/#FileSpirit_keep_your_documents_under_your_control|work=FileSpirit Website|publisher=espírito GmbH|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party cloud-based companies provide solutions which can be used to manage mobile files but are not controlled by corporate IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |title="Follow-Me Data" Means Secure Seamless Access to Work Wherever and Whenever You Need It! » ocb - Citrix Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2011-05-27 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131129025945/http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |archive-date=2013-11-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobiledevicemanagement.org/mobile-device-management-overview Mobile Device Management Overview | Mobile Device Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.filehold.com/products/mobile-filehold Mobile Document Management Software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that utilize [[Mobile Device Management]] solutions can also secure content on mobile devices, but usually cannot provide [[Direct access (computing)|direct access]] and connection to a corporate file server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ Device Management Forum - Mobile Device Management - Brave New Horizon or Basic Plumbing?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801091503/http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ |date=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

File management is how the computer [[operating system]] keeps [[data]] organized through the use of files and folders, how they are arranged, and how they are listed in a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpbestflow.org/file-management/file-management-overview#what Overview of File Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile file management allows file management to be used on tablet computers. By installing it both on the tablet and the corporate server, users of mobile devices can freely access corporate servers from remote locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9165">'''Peter Demeter''' (born 19 April 1933) is a Hungarian-born Canadian former real estate developer convicted in 1974 of arranging the murder of his wife. It was the longest trial in Canadian history and revealed that both husband and wife may have been plotting to murder the other to collect a $1 million insurance policy. The assailant was never found.

While serving his sentence and living in a convicts' halfway house, in 1983 Demeter was charged on two counts with trying to arrange the kidnapping and murder of the son of his cousin; the latter was managing his financial affairs. In 1985 Demeter was convicted of the charges and given a second life sentence.

==Early life and education==
Demeter was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary into a wealthy family that became impoverished following World War II and the rise of the Communist government. In 1956 at the age of 23, Demeter emigrated to Canada. He was among 200,000 refugees who escaped from the country after suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Report by Soviet Deputy Interior Minister M.

==Marriage and family==
In 1967 Demeter married [[Christine Demeter|Christine Ferrari]], an Austrian-born model. They had a daughter, Andrea,&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; together, but the marriage became strained. On 18 July 1973, the 33-year-old Christine was found murdered, bludgeoned to death in the garage of their family home in [[Mississauga, Ontario]].

By 1985 when Demeter was convicted of other charges, he had a fiancée, Lisa Ross.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bWQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oFMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=885,320548&amp;hl=en "Demeter Convicted of Trying to Kill Cousin"], ''The Windsor Star'', 3 July 1985, accessed 13 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges and trials==
Demeter was charged with the murder of his wife Christine on 18 July 1973 at their home at 1437 Dundas Crescent North, [[Mississauga]], Ontario. He was subsequently tried for murder and represented by lawyers [[Edward Greenspan]] and Joseph Pomerant.

In what was the longest trial in Canadian history, he was convicted on 6 December 1974 of arranging for the murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The two primary witnesses for the prosecution included a so-called Mr. X who was hooded (to protect his identity) throughout the trial and later identified as Gyala Virag who testified that Demeter had hired a hit man with the nickname "The Duck" (Kacsa in Hungarian), later identified as a small-time criminal named Imre Olejnyik.&lt;ref name="Insauga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insauga.com/mississauga-s-most-notorious-murder-case-peter-Demeter |title=Mississauga’s Most Notorious Murder Case - Peter Demeter |last=Newport |first=Ashley |date=25 January 2016 |website=Insauga |publisher=Insauga |access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other significant witness was Demeter's former friend and police informant, Csaba Szilagy, who testified that the defendant had tried to hire him to murder Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/51094808/  |newspaper=San Antonio Express |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=22 December 1974 |access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution's case was aided by tapes secretly recorded by Szilagy of conversations with Demeter after his wife's murder.&lt;ref name="Star"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Insauga"/&gt; During the trial, it was revealed that the husband and wife may each have been plotting to murder the other to collect on  $1 million insurance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GMkyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4508,2410536&amp;dq=peter-demeter&amp;hl=en|title=Demeter gets life for murder of wife|date=December 6, 1974|work=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Demeter did not testify but maintained his innocence.&lt;ref name="CanCrime"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancrime.com/2009/08/18/wife-killer-peter-demeter-gives-up-on-freedom/ |title=Wife killer Peter Demeter gives up on freedom |last=Tripp |first=Rob |date=18 August 2009 |website=CanCrime |publisher=Trumedia |access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 1974, the Canadian government requested extradition from Hungary of Imre Olejnyik, who was suspected of the physical murder of Christine Demeter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GMkyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3813,2517412&amp;hl=en The Canadian Press, "Government Requesting Extradition"], ''Ottawa Citizen'', 6 December 1974, accessed 13 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was never found. Subsequent news reports indicated that "The Duck" had died in Hungary in 1975.&lt;ref name="Insauga"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Demeter Murder Trial One of Canada’s Longest|url=http://www.niagarathisweek.com/opinion-story/3264728-demeter-murder-trial-one-of-canada-s-longest/ |newspaper=Niagara This Week, Metroland Media |location=St. Catharines, Ontario |date=16 April 2012 |access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CanCrime"/&gt;

In 1983 while living at a convicts' halfway house, Demeter was charged with planning a kidnapping and murder of a cousin's son, who had been taking care of his financial affairs and his daughter. He intended to have this individual  kidnapped to gain money and then have him killed. Demeter was convicted in July 1985 while in prison and given a second life sentence.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hRUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tKUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3290,525872&amp;dq=peter-demeter+cousin+convicted&amp;hl=en|title=Demeter guilty of murder plot|date=July 3, 1985|work=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was also charged with arson in 1983 in connection with the family home in Mississauga. In 1988, he was charged with planning to kidnap and murder the daughter of his lawyer, Toby Belman, resulting in two additional life sentences.&lt;ref name="Insauga"/&gt;

In May 2006 a judge ordered Demeter to provide a [[DNA]] sample to the country's DNA data bank, as law enforcement was collecting data from prisoners. (Demeter had refused to allow a sample to be taken.)&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

While in prison, Demeter has suffered a stroke and a heart attack. He has had [[chemotherapy]] administered in relation to three diagnoses of cancer.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2006/05/30/todemeter20060530.html|title=CBC News - Toronto - Demeter ordered to hand over DNA sample|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=17 October 2010|date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter is serving his term at the medium-security Bath Institute in [[Bath, Ontario]]. In a CBC interview on 30 May 2006, he said conclusively that he will be in prison for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Demeter's story and trial served as the basis for the 1978 fictional film ''[[I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses]]'' (also called ''Drop Dead, Dearest'' and ''Left for Dead''), directed by Murray Markowitz. His figure in the movie, named Charles Kruschen, is played by actor [[Donald Pilon (actor)|Donald Pilon]]. His wife was played by [[Elke Sommer]]. The film caused controversy in the UK when it was listed as a [[video nasty]] by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1012155-left_for_dead/ ''I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses''], Rotten Tomatoes, accessed 13 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder and trial were the subject of ''By Persons Unknown: The Strange Death of Christine Demeter'', by [[George Jonas]] and [[Barbara Amiel]], winner of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s 1978 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Fact Crime book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12258">The '''Philippine Cyberservices Corridor''' is a plan that is being pursued by the government of the [[Philippines]] to create interconnected centers of [[cyberservices|technology-related services]], that are spread out all over the country. Services include [[business process outsourcing]], [[medical transcription]], [[outsourcing of animation]], and the like.  It is part of the ten-point agenda of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] and is one of the five "[[Super regions of the Philippines|super-regions]]" outlined in her 2006 [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]].

The completion of the Philippine Cyber Corridor was expected to accelerate the growth of the [[Business process outsourcing in the Philippines|Information Technology and Business Process Management]] (ITM-BPM) Industry in the country. Most recent figures according to the [[International Labour Organization]] have shown a total revenue of $18.4 billion in the entire Philippine BPO industry for the year 2014. This figure formed 6 per cent of the entire GDP that year and employed 1.03 million people. The Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) and the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Philippines’ Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST) outlined in their road map for 2011–2016 forecasts that the BPO industry would reach a target of $25 billion in revenues by 2016. This would form 7.3 per cent of the country’s GDP and employ 1.2 million people. The ITM-BPM sector was also expected to support 3.2 million indirect jobs by 2016, which would comprise employees in the [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) sector as well as research facilities.&lt;ref name="SYMACO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Symaco|first1=Lorraine|title=Higher Education in the Philippines and Malaysia: the Learning Region in the Age of Knowledge-based Societies|journal=Journal of International and Comparative Education|date=2012|pages=40–51|url=http://e-journal.um.edu.my/filebank/published_article/3641/symaco.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines cited Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as a key sector to the nation’s progress. The Philippine Cyber Corridor was thus conceived as a business that would be able to compete on the international ICT market.

In her sixth State of the Nation Address in 2006, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo promised that her administration would develop the Philippine Cyber Corridor along with other “natural ‘super regions’ of the Philippines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macapagal-Arroyo|first1=Gloria|title=Sixth State of the Nation Address, July 24, 2006|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2006/07/24/gloria-macapagal-arroyo-sixth-state-of-the-nation-address-july-24-2006/|website=The Official Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arroyo believed that the corridor had the potential for increasing telecommunications, technology and education in the country. In addition, she saw the development of the corridor as a counterpoint to the rising number of [[Overseas Filipino Workers]] (OFWs), as members of the work force would ideally no longer have to leave the country in order to secure a job. Furthermore, she promised budget increases for science &amp; technology and education, both important to telecommunications.

The Arroyo administration thus embarked on a campaign to increase telecommunications-related services in the country. In 2004, the [[Commission on Information and Communications Technology]] (CICT) was established. One of its aims was to fashion the Philippine Cyber Corridor after the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in Malaysia, which was built in 1997.&lt;ref name="SYMACO" /&gt;

==Services==
The PCC hosts BPO companies, call centers, animations studios, software development and gaming businesses, medical and legal transcription outfits, knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) outfits, and back office operations of multinational companies.&lt;ref name="SYMACO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DIGITAL REVIEW"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Akhtar |editor-first=Shahid |editor-last2=Arinto |editor-first2=Patricia |title=Digital review of Asia Pacific : 2009-2010|date=2009|publisher=IDRC, Orbicom, and Sage|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-321-0084-3|page=304|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on Local Economy==
The development of the PCC along key cities in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao also aims to create new IT related jobs for fresh graduates of the respective cities. In creating a demand for the IT industry, local schools and colleges were also inclined to adapt their curriculum to equip their students with skills for the IT sector.&lt;ref name="PALISADA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palisada|first1=Stanley|title=The Light and Shade of the Cyber Corridor|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/views-and-analysis/02/10/10/light-and-shade-cyber-corridor-stanley-palisada|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirectly, the development of the PCC across the nation has also resulted in numerous opportunities for other businesses such to flourish. The hospitality sector, specifically hotels and restaurants catering to ICT and BPO employees, has seen notable growth from this.&lt;ref name="PALISADA" /&gt;

== Locations ==
According to Arroyo’s 2006 SONA, the corridor runs 600 miles from the city of Baguio in the north of the country to the city of Zamboanga in the south of the country.
Call centers have opened in Bacolod City, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro and Baguio. Business process outsourcing operations have also sprung up in Angeles, Legaspi, and Tacloban. Medical transcription agents centers have been established in Dumaguete, Davao, and Naga. [[Silicon Gulf]] in Davao, whose name was adapted from [[Silicon Valley]], was constructed to form part as a major center of the corridor.

In August 19, 2006, Executive Order No. 561&lt;ref name="Executive Order No. 561"&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 561|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo2006/eo_561_2006.html|website=The LawPhil Project|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was declared by Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, stating the formation of “super” regions and mandate of the super regional development champions. The Philippine economy was to be restructured into "super" regions to bolster the natural advantages of five distinct sub-economies regions of the country in order to create opportunity across the country.

Five geographical units were grounded into the following "super" regions&lt;ref name="Executive Order No. 561"/&gt; and would have respective development themes: a) Northern Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle for agribusiness and was to be composed of Regions I, II, Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), and the northern part of the provinces of Aurora (north of Baler), Tarlac (north of Tarlac City), Nueva Ecija (north of Cabanatuan City), and Zambales (north of Subic); b) Luzon Urban Beltway for a globally competitive industrial and service center, to be composed of the National Capital Region, (NCR), Region IV-A, the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Mindoro, Marinduque, and the southern parts of the provinces of Tarlac, Zambales, Aurora and Nueva Ecija; c) Central Philippines for tourism, to be composed of Regions V, VI, VII, and VIII, and the provinces of Romblon, Palawan, and Camiguin, and the Island of Siargao; d) Agribusiness Mindanao for agribusiness, to be composed of Regions IX, X except Camigiun, XI, XII, Caraga except Siargao, and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao; and e) Cyber Corridor for information and communication technology and knowledge economy, which traverses the above "super" regions from Baguio to Cebu to Davao.

Development champions&lt;ref name="Executive Order No. 561"/&gt; were also assigned for each super region, and their roles included serving as catalyst for development of the strategic theme in his area, ensuring the implementation of priority programs and projects, work out operational policies and remedial actions, as well as submitting a monthly report to the Presidential Management staff. 
The Development Champions are the following:
a) North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle - PMS Director-General Arthur Yap;
b) Luzon Urban Beltway - Subic-Clark Alliance for Development Chairman Edgardo Pamintuan;
c) Central Philippines - Secretary of Tourism Joseph Ace Durano; Secretary Cerge Remonde shall be the Cabinet Officer for Regional Development of region VII; 
d) Agribusiness Mindanao - Presidential Adviser for the Peace Process Jesus Dureza;
e) Cyber Corridor - Commission on Information and Communication Technology Chairman Ramon Sales.

=== Next Wave Cities ===
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo served as a guest speaker at the Angeles University Foundation (AUF) on February 1, 2010, and at the Jose Rizal University on February 2, 2010 during her “cyber corridor” tour. This tour started in Pamapanga and was said to highlight the former president’s achievements in terms of the digital infrastructure built during her term as well as the rise of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arroyo kicks off ‘cyber corridor’ tour in Pampanga|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/182963/arroyo-kicks-off-cyber-corridor-tour-in-pampanga/story/|accessdate=15 July 2017|date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her speech, the former president mentioned that the cyber corridor stretched from “the north from Metro Pampanga and goes down to the south of Davao City.” Arroyo also listed 10 urban areas in the Philippines that known as “Next Wave Cities” also form the cyber corridor. These cities include: Metro Laguna, Metro Cavite, Iloilo, Davao, Bacolod, Metro Pampanga, Metro Bulacan, Cagayan de Oro, Central Bulacan and Lipa.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macapagal-Arroyo|first1=Gloria|title=PRESIDENT GLORIA MACAPAGAL ARROYO’S SPEECH DURING THE CYBER CORRIDOR NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION TOUR: VISIT TO JOSE RIZAL UNIVERSITY (JRU)|url=http://www.op.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27420&amp;Itemid=38|website=Wayback Machine|accessdate=15 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407235122/http://www.op.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27420&amp;Itemid=38|archivedate=7 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cities are said to be the “best new destinations of the ICT industry."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17742">{{Insolvency}}

'''Provisional liquidation''' is a process which exists as part of the [[insolvency|corporate insolvency]] laws of a number of [[common law jurisdictions]] whereby after the lodging of a petition for the [[winding-up]] of a [[company]] by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a "provisional" basis.&lt;ref name=Practical&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the ''[[status quo]]'' pending the hearing of the petition.)  Unlike a conventional [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref name=Worrells&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worrells.net.au/InsolvencyResources/FactsheetArticle.aspx?ArticleId=14 |title=Provisional Liquidation |publisher=Worrells |author= |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some type of allegation of [[fraud]] or other misconduct relating to the company.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

Typically, an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator is made by either:&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;
# a creditor, where they are concerned that the assets of the company are at risk or might be dissipated or put beyond the reach of creditors during the period before the winding up application is heard;
# the shareholders, where they are concerned that the [[board of directors|directors of the company]] are acting improperly; or
# the company itself.  This may arise due to a dispute between directors and other officers, or because the company is insolvent and the directors do not want to risk insolvent trading claims in the period before an official liquidator is appointed.  In some jurisdictions (but not all) the company may apply to put itself into provisional liquidation to shield itself from creditor claims whilst it tries to implement a [[restructuring]].

The remedy is an exceptional one, and most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator are made because of concerns about some type of material impropriety.&lt;ref name=Fraud /&gt;  In exceptional cases it is also possible for public authorities to apply for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to protect the public interest from fraud or other similar conduct, although this is much less common.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}, in which the company was operating an unlawful lottery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invariably has a discretion whether to appoint a provisional liquidator.  A court will not normally approve the application unless it is satisfied that there is a strong liklihood that a liquidator will be appointed on the substantive application.  But even if the company is likely to go into liquidation, provisional liquidation is still an exceptional interim or "emergency remedy".&lt;ref name=Kill &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3harecourt.com/assets/asset-store/file/articles/Lewis-Yousuf.pdf |title=Provisional liquidations - kill or cure? |publisher=Business Rescue |author=Daniel Lewis and Nyla Yousuf |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There needs to be special reasons for the appointment of a provisional liquidator in the interim period.  Normally this is because the assets must face a high risk of dissipation or there must be some other urgent reason why a liquidator is required for the interim period.&lt;ref name=Clayton &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claytonutz.com/area_of_law/restructuring_and_insolvency/docs/ProvisionalLiquid.pdf |title=Restructuring &amp; Insolvency - Provisional liquidation |publisher=[[Clayton Utz]] |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are most likely to be granted in situations where:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* it is necessary to have an independent person investigate the company and its affairs;
* there was an urgent need to act to preserve assets of the company;
* there was a material [[conflict of interest]] between a director and the company; or
* there had been impropriety in the conduct of company’s affairs.

Conversely, because there needs to be some urgency or risk of dissipation of assets, applications are likely to be refused if:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* the only reason relied on by a creditor was that the company was insolvent (without more);
* an [[administrative receiver]] or [[administrator (law)|administrator]] had already been appointed, negating the risk of dissipation of assets;
* the application was made for an improper purpose, such as to maximise the applicant’s own position;
* the application was made simply to try and permit the company to continue to trade where the company is insolvency and clearly should be wound up; or
* there was a genuine dispute as to the creditor’s debt.

Given their nature, applications for provisional liquidation are often made urgently and without giving notice to the company or its directors.  Where the application is made without notice:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# the applicant is under a duty to give "full and frank disclosure" to the court of all material facts (including any facts which are adverse to the applicant); and
# the applicant will normally have to give an undertaking in damages to compensate the company for any loss caused if it subsequently transpires after a full hearing that the order should not have been.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==

If the court makes the order then a provisional liquidator is appointed over the company, and the control of all assets of the company, and the conduct of any business and other affairs of the company are transferred to the provisional liquidator.  The directors cease to have any authority.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;  In almost all jurisdictions, the provisional liquidator will normally have to be a licensed insovency practitioner.   

The provisional liquidator will generally only have the powers and functions conferred upon him or her by the order of the court.  It is not normally part of the role of a provisional liquidator to collect and sell the assets of the company, or otherwise take steps in relation to the actual winding up the company.  The principal reason for the appointment is the preservation of the company's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the common functions of a provisional liquidator is to investigate whether the company's property has been misappropriated or its business has been wrongfully conducted.  But generally speaking a provisional liquidator will not have power to bring proceedings on behalf of the company for [[wrongful trading]], or to challenge transactions as [[undervalue transaction]]s or [[unfair preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=In the matter of Overnight Limited|year=2009|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==

Provisional liquidation will normally come to an end in one of three ways:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# a full winding up order is made;
# an order of the court is made discharging the provisional liquidation (normally at an ''inter partes'' hearing to challenge the original appointment); or
# the winding up petition itself is dismissed.

==Specific jurisdictions==

The effect of provisional liquidation varies from jurisdiction to the jurisdiction.

===Australia===

{{Main|Australian insolvency law}}

In Australia provisional liquidation is regulated by section 472(2) of [[Corporations Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s472.html|title=Corporations Act 2001, section 472|accessdate=30 July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia provisional liquidators must be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;

===British Virgin Islands===

{{Main|British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law}}

Under British Virgin Islands law provisional liquidation is regulated by section 170(4) of the Insolvency Act 2003.&lt;ref name=BVI&gt;{{cite book|title=British Virgin Islands Commercial Law|author=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|edition=3rd|year=2014|isbn=9789626615294|at=7.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Akai Holdings Limited v Brinlow Investments Limited''&lt;ref&gt;(BVIHCV 2006/0134) at [44] onwards.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an applicant would need to show four things:
# a petition before the court for the appointment of a liquidator;
# a good arguable case that a ground for the appointment of a liquidator exists;
# a good arguable case that the applicant has the necessary standing; and
# that the court should exercise its discretion to maintain the ''status quo'' in relation to the company’s assets.

===Canada===

In Canada provision liquidation is regulated under section 28 of the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/w-11/page-8.html |title=Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11) |publisher=Justice Laws Website |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cayman Islands===

{{Main|Cayman Islands bankruptcy law}}

In the Cayman Islands provisional liquidation is principally regulated by section 104(3) of the Companies Law (2013) Revision.  One unusual feature of provisional liquidation in Cayman is that it is possible to appoint a provisional liquidator and still allow the directors to retain their powers of management.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Winding Up Rules (2008 Revision), Order 4, rule 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  This in part facilitates a slightly unusual use of provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands as part of a [[debtor in possession]] corporate rehabilitation prcoess.  The company itself will apply for an order for provisional liquidation, and provisional liquidators are appointed which effectively creates a stay on the claims of [[unsecured creditor]]s.  The  board of directors can then use that "breathing space" to try and implement a restructuring of the company's debts pursuant to a [[scheme of arrangement]], or pursuant to an international restructuring process in the courts of another jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=Maples &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplesandcalder.com/news/article/cayman-islands-provisional-liquidations-in-support-of-chapter-11-proceedings-433/ |title=Cayman Islands Provisional Liquidations in Support of Chapter 11 Proceedings |publisher=[[Maples and Calder]] |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has not been rejected in the courts of other jurisdictions (such as Hong Kong),&lt;ref name=Legend &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f806367c-2c17-db11-8a10-00065bfd3168 |title=Corporate Rescue: The Need for Legislation |publisher=International Law Office |author=Andrew Kinnison and Jacky Yeung |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but accepted in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT136&amp;lpg=PT136&amp;dq=new+zealand+law+provisional+liquidation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jp6iPhZb&amp;sig=mwLDD1xUQfxnM6jdHn3ywmCg6Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20zealand%20law%20provisional%20liquidation&amp;f=false |title=Principles of International Insolvency |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |author=Philip R. Wood |isbn=9781847032102 |year=2007 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong there are three types of provisional liquidators.&lt;ref name=BWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briscoewongferrier.com/web2/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProvisionalLiquidators1.pdf |title=Provisional Liquidators |publisher=Briscoe Wong Ferrier |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are "traditional" provisional liquidators, appointed under section 193 of the Hong Kong Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32); there are also provisional liquidators appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary liquidation under section 228A of the Ordinance, and there are "Panel T" appointments under section 194(1A) of the Ordinance whereby the Official Receiver is appointed as provisional liquidator.  

Since the decision in the ''Legend'' case in 2006&lt;ref&gt;''Re Legend International Resorts Ltd'' [2006] 2 HKLRD 192&lt;/ref&gt; provisional liquidation may not be used as a means of shielding the company from creditor's claims to facilitate a restructuring in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; although prior to that date the practice was relatively common.&lt;ref name=BWF /&gt;

===South Africa===

In South Africa "provisional liquidation" has a very different meaning.  When a creditor or other person applies to the court for the liquidation of a business, then the order is first made a provisional basis, and then subsequent confirmed (or not) at a full hearing, much like a ''decree nisi'' and a ''decree absolut'' in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findanattorney.co.za/content_business-liquidation|title=Liquidating a Business in South Africa|publisher=FindanAttorney|author=Nanika Prinsloo|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom insolvency law}}
In the United Kingdom the power to appoint a provisional liquidator is found in section 135(1), of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], and it is regarded as an "emergency procedure".&lt;Ref name=Practical /&gt;  The categories of persons who may apply for the appointment are set out at rule 4.25(1) of the Insolvency Rules 1986.&lt;ref&gt;SI 1925 of 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under English law all provisional liquidators are required to be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986, section 388(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; 
If, upon the application for the appointment of a liquidator, there are concerns about potential dissipation of assets, or misconduct on the part of the directors, then the court may order the appointment of a [[provisional liquidator]].&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisional liquidation is essentially an 
"emergency procedure".  A provisional liquidator may only be appointed by the court only after a winding-up petition has been presented&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986 s 135(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  The main reason for appointing a provisional liquidator is normally to preserve the company's assets.  In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some kind of [[fraud]] or other misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Revenue &amp; Customs v Rochdale Drinks Distributors Ltd|year=2011|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=1116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it will normally be necessary to establish either (or both) that: (a) the company is clearly insolvent, and it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and/or (b) there has been the type of misconduct that would justify a just and equitable winding-up.  An appointment of a provisional liquidator may also be made where it is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the emergency nature of the remedy applications for provisional liquidation are very often made urgently and without giving notice to the company.  In such cases the applicant is under a legal obligation to give full and frank disclosure to the court of all material facts, including facts which are adverse to the applicant's own case.  The applicant will also normally be required to give an undertaking in damages in the event the court subsequently determines that the order should not have been made to compensate the company for any damage caused to it by the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a provisional liquidator is appointed then the powers of the company's directors are effectively terminated, and the board will retain only a residual power to apply to dismiss or resist the winding-up petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appointment of a provisional liquidator comes to an end when:&lt;ref name=PL /&gt;
# a liquidator is appointed at a full hearing;
# the provisional liquidator is discharged by order of the court; or
# the underlying winding up petition is dismissed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10792">'''Ramón Buenaventura Báez Figueroa''' (born in 1956) is the former president of [[Banco Intercontinental]] (BANINTER) from the [[Dominican Republic]], accused in 2003 of masterminding the country's most spectacular banking fraud scandal, amounting to more than US$2.2 billion.

==Family and early life==
Descendant of two Dominican presidents ([[Buenaventura Báez]] and [[Ramón Báez|Ramón Báez Machado]]),&lt;ref name=IDG_LosBaez&gt;{{cite web |first=Edwin |last=Espinal |title=Los Báez |url=http://hoy.com.do/capsulas-genealogicaslos-baez/ |accessdate=1 December 2014 |work=Cápsulas genealógicas (Instituto Dominicano de Genealogía) |date=10 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422120100/http://hoy.com.do/capsulas-genealogicaslos-baez/ |archivedate=22 April 2014 |publisher=Hoy |location=Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Báez Figueroa comes from an influential Dominican family.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; His father is the entrepreneur [[Ramón Báez Romano]], grandson of former president Ramón Báez Machado.

He married María Rosa Zeller Barrous, they had 2 children and divorced. On 12 January 1997, he remarried to Patricia Álvarez DuBreil, the granddaughter of the industrialist [[Horacio Álvarez Saviñón]] and [[Cousin#First cousins once removed|cousin-niece]] of [[Luis Álvarez Renta]], at [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa de Campo]] in a pompous, ostentatious wedding that cost more than [[US$]]&amp;nbsp;2 million of the time (US${{Inflation|US|2|1997|r=1}} million at {{currentyear}} prices) —in a country whose [[GDP per capita]] was around US$2,000— it was called the "Wedding of the Century";&lt;ref name=pciudadana&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ana Mitila Lora Gómez (Listín Diario)|author2=José de Córdoba (Wall Street Journal)|author3=Doralissa Pilarte (Latin Trade)|title=El Fraude en el BANINTER y sus Efectos en la Sociedad|date=2003|publisher=Participación Ciudadana|pages=157, 178, 205, 209|url=http://pciudadana.org/archivo/crisisbancaria/Libro/librobaninter.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced in 2013. He married for a third time in June 2014 to Sandra Martínez Yangüela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Se casa Ramón Báez Figueroa|url=http://cdn.com.do/noticias/2014/06/07/se-casa-ramon-baez-figueroa/|accessdate=1 December 2014|publisher=NCDN|date=7 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201041724/http://cdn.com.do/noticias/2014/06/07/se-casa-ramon-baez-figueroa/|archivedate=1 December 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brito|first1=Reynaldo|title=Boda de Ramón Báez Figueroa con Sandra Martínez|url=http://www.imagenesdominicanas.com/2014/06/Fotos-Boda-de-Ramon-Baez-Figueroa-con-Sandra-Martinez.html|publisher=Imágenes Dominicanas|accessdate=1 December 2014|language=Spanish|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the CEO of Banco Intercontinental (BANINTER) from 1993 until its collapse in 2003; he and his father controlled at least 80% of the shares. He was lionized as the Dominican ''[[King Midas]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

In 2001, BANINTER alone was worth RD$25.57 billion or US$1.51 billion (US${{Inflation|US|1.51|1997|r=2}} billion in {{currentyear}} prices).&lt;ref name=pciudadana/&gt;

==BANINTER crisis==
Báez Figueroa was arrested May 15, 2003 along with BANINTER vice presidents Marcos Báez Cocco and Vivian Lubrano de Castillo, the secretary of the Board of Directors, Jesús M. Troncoso, and financer [[Luis Álvarez Renta]], on charges of [[bank fraud]], [[money laundering]] and concealing information from the government as part of a massive fraud scheme of more than [[Dominican peso|RD$]]&amp;nbsp;55 billion (USD&amp;nbsp;$2.2 billion). This sum would be big anywhere, but it was overwhelming for the [[Economy of the Dominican Republic|Dominican economy]], equivalent to two-thirds of its national budget.

The resulting central bank bailout spurred 30 percent annual inflation and a large increase in poverty. The government was forced to devalue the peso, triggering the collapse of two other banks, and prompting a [[US$]]&amp;nbsp;600 million (420 million [[€]]) loan package from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071021/ap_on_bi_ge/dominican_bank_fraud_trial_1&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking crisis ignited harsh fights over the bank group’s media outlets, including the prominent newspaper [[Listín Diario]], which was temporarily seized and run by the [[Mejía administration]] following the BANINTER collapse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Moreover, it was prompted, as detailed at length in the trial that opened in April 2006, by a scandal involving debt writeoffs and sweetheart loans or other financial deals suspected of having favored leading politicians and others.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071021/bs_nm/dominican_fraud_dc_2&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors that Baninter might have been in trouble began circulating during fall of 2002, and depositors started to withdraw their savings. The [[Dominican Central Bank]] stepped in to support the bank by providing new lines of credit. Anxious for a more permanent solution, the government announced in early 2003 that [[Banco del Progreso]], run by Pedro Castillo, the brother of Mr.&amp;nbsp;Mejía’s son-in-law, would acquire Baninter. But Banco del Progreso abruptly withdrew from the deal. Government officials said that two-thirds of the money that customers had deposited in Baninter was kept off its official books by a custom-designed software system. Banking regulators and the bank’s auditor, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], were deceived for years.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In April 2003, the government took control of Baninter. Mr.&amp;nbsp;Báez Figueroa’s family owned more than the 80% of the bank, and soon after, a deeper examination supported by the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, revealed the scale of the meltdown.

With 350 prosecution and defense witnesses slated to testify, ex-President [[Hipólito Mejía]] among them, the criminal proceedings against Mr.&amp;nbsp;Báez Figueroa began on April 2, 2006. However, the Collegiate Court decided to postpone the first hearing for May 19, 2006, accepting a  motion by the defense lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Dominicant Today, April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence==
On October 21, 2007, after the long trial that concluded on September, Báez Figueroa was sentenced by a three-judge panel to 10 years in prison. Additionally, he was ordered to pay restitution and damages totalling more than $31 million. The laundering charges were excluded, but another suspected mastermind of the fraud, financier Luis Álvarez Renta, was convicted and sentenced for money laundering to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=reutersnews&amp;articleid=MTFH30180_2007-10-21_20-20-49_N21382897&amp;feed=Bus&amp;action=article Business finance news - currency market news - online UK currency markets - financial news - Interactive Investor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcos Báez Cocco]], ex-vicepresident of the Bank, was also found guilty, but his sentence will be read on November 16.

Their defence attorneys said they would appeal.

The accusations against two other defendants, Báez’s personal assistant and former Baninter vicepresident Vivian Lubrano, as well as the secretary of the Baninter Board of Directors Jesús M. Troncoso, were dismissed for lack of evidence.

==Supporters==
Friends of Báez Figueroa, groping to explain the shortcuts he took in running BANINTER, pointed to his political connections and a lack of competent managers at the bank. Báez Figueroa's lawyer, [[Marino Vinicio Castillo]], said in an interview that the whole affair had been trumped up for political reasons, and that the claim that RD$55 billion had been embezzled was "a fable." Castillo went on to say that "very dark interests within the government that are blinded by ambition" were behind his client's imprisonment. He accused the government of wanting to dismember BANINTER and divide the spoils. [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] had audited Baninter's books for years and approved them "without any reservations," Mr. Castillo said. {{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

His defenders also say former President Mejía saw Báez Figueroa as a threat to his personal wealth and political influence and to Mejía's ambition to win another term in office. Taking control of BANINTER's media properties and using them to win over public opinion, not cleaning up a scandal, was what the government was after.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Even after his arrest Báez Figueroa remained a central figure in the country's elite, readily accessible even in jail. Within days of his arrest, he received visits from president Leonel Fernández and Hatuey de Camps, then president of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Smith|title=Fallen Banker Courted in Jail Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27DOMI.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=23 May 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422121502/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27DOMI.html|archivedate=22 April 2014|publisher=The New York Times|location=Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20167">'''Raoul Weil''' (born 13 November 1959) is a [[Swiss banker]]. Weil is best known as being the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking at [[UBS AG]]. Weil eventually became a member of UBS's Group Executive Board.

During Weil’s tenure at UBS, the Bank became embroiled in the [[UBS tax evasion controversy|2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy]], which led to Weil’s voluntary departure from the Bank after he was indicted by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] for allegedly offering help to thousands of UBS’s U.S. clients who failed to pay their federal income taxes. Arrested in October 2013 during a trip to Italy, Weil has been extradited to the United States.&lt;ref name="Swiss banker in eye"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa and Valentina Accardo|title=Swiss banker in eye of U.S. tax evasion storm to face court|url=https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-banker-eye-u-tax-evasion-storm-face-133139948--sector.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On  December 16, 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail by the federal district court in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fagenson|first=Zachary|title=Florida judge grants $10.5 million bail for ex-UBS banker|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/us-banker-extradition-tax-bail-idUSBRE9BF16Q20131216|accessdate=17 December 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014.

==Early life==
Weil was born in Switzerland.  Weil graduated from the University of Basel with a degree in economics.&lt;ref name="Weil Arrested in Italy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinuzzi|first=Elisa|title=Fugitive Ex-UBS Wealth Management Chief Weil Arrested in Italy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-21/fugitive-ex-ubs-wealth-management-chief-weil-arrested-in-italy.html|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned a masters in economics with a specialization in national economics and business administration.

== Charitable Activities==
Raoul Weil is a member of the Optimus Foundation, a charitable foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world.  In 2008, Weil was elected chairman of the Optimus Foundation’s board, pledging the foundation to the goal of becoming the largest charitable organization in Switzerland in the next decade.&lt;ref name="Weil Elected Chairman of Optimus"&gt;{{cite journal|title=With vigor into the future|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth_management/optimusfoundation/downloads/_jcr_content/par/table_2728.186018188.file/dGFibGVUZXh0PS9jb250ZW50L2RhbS91YnMvZ2xvYmFsL3dlYWx0aF9tYW5hZ2VtZW50L29wdGltdXNmb3VuZGF0aW9uLzEzMzU0N19VQlNfT3B0aW11c19lLnBkZg==/133547_UBS_Optimus_e.pdf|publisher=UBS Optimus World|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Weil led the Global UBS Philanthropy Forum, which brought together philanthropists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and representatives from civil society from around the world to consider the theme of “Building Change Communities.”&lt;ref name="UBS Philanthropy Forum brought to Asia for first time"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global UBS Philanthropy Forum brought to Asia for the first time|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/about_us/news/news.html/en/2008/09/12/2008_09_12.html|publisher=UBS|date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking career==
After he finished active duty in the Swiss military in 1984, Weil was hired by the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC), and worked in SBC's private banking division in [[Basel]], [[Zurich]], [[Monaco]], [[New York City]], and [[Hong Kong]] from 1984 until 1998. When SBC and UBS merged in 1998, Weil joined UBS as part of its private banking division for Asia and Europe, becoming head of UBS's Wealth Management International unit in 2002. In July 2007, Weil became CEO of WM&amp;BB.&lt;ref name="Weil Declared Fugitive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolker|first=Carlyn|title=Ex-UBS Executive Raoul Weil Declared a Fugitive by U.S. Judge|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aSEvhPR7Ok6A|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2008, Weil voluntarily relinquished his duties with UBS to focus on his defense after being indicted in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Statement on Indictment of UBS Executive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/media/global/releases/news_display_media_global.html/en/2008/11/12/2008_11_12.html|title=Statement On Indictment Of UBS Executive|publisher=UBS|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States issued an international arrest warrant for Weil in 2008.

On May 23, 2008, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (EBK, the predecessor to FINMA) opened an investigation into UBS’s role in facilitating tax evasion by its US clients.  The EBK concluded, among other things, that UBS’s “top management” was not aware of the Bank’s US clients’ fraudulent conduct, and were not “accessories or accomplices” to UBS’s violations.&lt;ref name="EBK investigation of UBS business with US private clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finma.ch/d/aktuell/Documents/kurzbericht-ubs-x-border-20090218-e.pdf|title=EBK investigation of the cross-border business of UBS AG with its private clients in the USA|publisher=FINMA|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBK also found that the US cross-border business’s managers at the time – Martin Liechti and Michel Guignard&lt;ref name="US Senate Staff Report on Tax Haven Banks"&gt;{{cite web|url=TAX HAVEN BANKS AND U. S. TAX COMPLIANCE: Staff Report|title=|publisher=US Senate|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were the principal architects of UBS’s wrongdoing and had actively concealed their misconduct from Weil.&lt;ref name="EBK investigation of UBS business with US private clients"/&gt;

After leaving UBS, Weil was hired as a consultant in 2010 by Reuss Private Group ([[Pfäffikon, Schwyz]], Switzerland), eventually becoming a managing partner.&lt;ref name="Italian police arrest fugitive"&gt;{{cite news|title=Italian police arrest ‘fugitive’ Swiss banker|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/Italian_police_arrest_fugitive_Swiss_banker_.html?cid=37154608|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=International Service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of 2013, he succeeded [[Adriano B. Lucatelli]] as chief executive officer of Reuss Private Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to the arrest of Raoul Weil|url=http://www.frank-cs.org/cms/pdfs/CH/RPG/RPG_Weil_PressRelease_21.10.13.pdf|publisher=Reuss Private Group|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, FINMA granted Reuss a license to deal in securities and certified that Reuss management, including Weil, was engaged in “proper business conduct” (Gewähr für eine einwandfreie Geschäftstätigkeit).  As part of the application process, Weil confirmed in writing that he had not concealed anything with respect to the US-UBS tax dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verhafteter Banker hatte Persilschein der Finma|url=http://bazonline.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Verhafteter-Banker-hatte-Persilschein-der-Finma/story/25021011|publisher=Tages Anzeiger|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2013, Weil was replaced by Felix Brem as CEO of Reuss Private Group.&lt;ref name="Felix Brem new CEO of Reuss Private Group"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felix Brem new CEO of Reuss Private Group|url=http://reussprivategroup.com/uploads/media/RPG_CEO_131202_eng.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=Reuss Private Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Tax Evasion Controversy==
{{main article|UBS tax evasion controversy}}
In 2008, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] began probing a multimillion-dollar [[UBS tax evasion controversy|tax evasion]] case involving UBS due to disclosures made by [[Brad Birkenfeld]], a former UBS banker in Switzerland, who was arrested entering the United States and cooperated with the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and the US [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTfwAG7pDZAUUS8_feZQgnnHAeaQ |title=AFP: FBI 'to probe Swiss bank UBS' in tax dodging case |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=June 22, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107001519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTfwAG7pDZAUUS8_feZQgnnHAeaQ |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1036|title=National Whistleblowers Center – Bradley Birkenfeld Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Whistleblowers]].org|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrently, a [[United States Senate]] subcommittee accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through [[offshore account]]s, which it estimated cost of the U.S. excess of US$100&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="UBS Says It Won’t Turn Over More Names in IRS Suit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Voreacos, Donmoyer|first=David, Ryan|title=UBS Says It Won’t Turn Over More Names in IRS Suit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aWDQWshGiCig|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4348822.ece|title=US Senate claims UBS 'colluded' behind Swiss bank secrecy laws|work=The Times|accessdate=February 20, 2009|place=London|first1=Miles|last1=Costello|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121624391105859731?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Offshore Tax Evasion Costs U.S. $100&amp;nbsp;billion, Senate Probe of UBS and LGT indicates|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=February 20, 2009|first=Evan|last=Perez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20081112006425&amp;newsLang=en|title=Statement on Indictment of UBS Executive|publisher=[[BusinessWire]]|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its investigation into the conduct of UBS’s US cross-border business, DOJ demanded client banking records from UBS.  Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, UBS was prohibited from turning over such documents.  The Swiss government interceded and began negotiating with DOJ in an effort to persuade DOJ to stop trying to force UBS to violate Swiss law. On November 6, 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3aa635bc-b124-11dd-8915-0000779fd18c,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F3aa635bc-b124-11dd-8915-0000779fd18c.html%3Fnclick_check%3D1&amp;_i_referer=&amp;nclick_check=1|title=UBS suffers offshore blow as US indicts wealth management head|work=Financial Times|accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOJ obtained an order from the court there placing the indictment under seal. On November 10, 2008, Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz and Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen asking that DOJ go through the information-sharing provisions of the US-Switzerland Double Taxation Treaty if it wanted to obtain information regarding UBS’s clients.  Weil’s indictment was unsealed two days later, on November 12, 2008.  According to one high-level Swiss source, “[t]hat was a clear message . . .

Weil soon thereafter left the Bank to focus on the criminal case. On February 18, 2009, UBS agreed to pay a fine of US$780&amp;nbsp;million to the U.S. government and entered into a [[deferred prosecution agreement]] on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a_TaQP5WVZuA&amp;refer=home|title=UBS Will Pay $780&amp;nbsp;million to Settle U.S. Tax Claims, Bloomberg.com website (18 Feb 2009)|publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 30, 2005|accessdate=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-tax-136.html|title=UBS Enters into Deferred Prosecution Agreement|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/worldbusiness/19ubs.html?hp|title=A Swiss Bank Is Set to Open Its Secret Files|date=February 19, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 19, 2009|first=Lynnley|last=Browning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20905.htm |title=U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 20905 / February 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115944/http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20905.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2013 }} Retrieved on July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Weil’s charges were not dismissed as part of UBS’s deal, and he continued to face charges even after UBS had settled its criminal case and a subsequent dispute with the US government and IRS in the Fall of 2009, which resulted in UBS’s agreeing to turn over thousands of US customer files to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/worldbusiness/19ubs.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title=A Swiss Bank Is Set to Open Its Secret Files|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/business/global/18irs.html|title=14,700 Disclosed Offshore Accounts|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2014, the National Whistleblowers Center claimed that Weil "will make a sweetheart deal with the DOJ" because he has "information that would be extremely embarrassing to wealthy and powerful people" in the United States and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowersblog.org/2014/01/articles/tax-whistleblowers/federal-court-hearing-scheduled-for-ubs-tax-fraud-kingpin-raoul-weil/|title=Federal Court Hearing Scheduled for UBS Tax Fraud Kingpin Raoul Weil| publisher=Whistleblowers Protection Blog|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this claim, no such deal has apparently been reached.  Weil is preparing for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/07/ex-ubs-executive-weil-faces-eight-month-wait-as-u-s-trial-delayed/|title=Ex-UBS Executive Weil Faces Eight-Month Wait as U.S. Trial Delayed| publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date= February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Issues==

Weil was declared a fugitive by Judge James Cohn on January 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSEvhPR7Ok6A&amp;refer=home "Ex-UBS Executive Raoul Weil Named Fugitive by U.S. Judge" Bloomberg News, 14 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Weil has maintained his innocence of the charges against him. Weil, who remained in Switzerland, his home country and place of residence, after being indicted, maintains that he did not run from the United States.&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"/&gt;

===Extradition to U.S.===

On October 19, 2013, Weil was arrested in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]] while on a trip from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-manager svizzero Ubs accusato 
di frode fiscale arrestato a Bologna", Oct. 9, 2013, la Repubblica, at [http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/20/news/manager_svizzero_accusato_di_frode_fiscale_arrestato_a_bologna-69001372/?ref=HREC1-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Martinuzzi &amp; Elena Logutenkova, "Fugitive Ex-UBS Wealth Management Chief Weil Arrested in Italy," Oct. 21, 2013, Bloomberg News, at [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-21/fugitive-ex-ubs-wealth-management-chief-weil-arrested-in-italy.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Weil's request for house arrest was turned down by Italian authorities,&lt;ref name="Judge rejects house arrest bid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa|title=Judge rejects house arrest bid by jailed ex-UBS banker: source|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/17/us-banker-arrest-ubs-idUSBRE9AG04U20131117|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Weil decided not to contest extradition to the United States.&lt;ref name="Swiss banker in eye" /&gt; Weil's willingness to return to the U.S. raised the suspicion that he may have been offered a "sweetheart deal" by the U.S. Department of Justice, which treated another UBS conspirator, [[Martin Liechti]], extremely leniently, according to Bradley Birkenfeld's lawyer, [[Stephen M. Kohn]] of the [[National Whistleblower Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whistleblower Fears UBS Banker Raoul Weil Will Get Sweetheart Deal|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1448&amp;Itemid=71|publisher=National Whistleblower Center|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkenfeld worked several levels below Weil at UBS, and apparently did not know him. According to Kohn, Weil "knows where all the skeletons are buried. Kohn claims that, "Weil can clearly bargain inside information he has that could be embarrassing to American officials or institutions for leniency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-UBS bank executive to enter plea in tax fraud case|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/uk-ubs-tax-banker-idUKBREA0606620140107|publisher=Reuters UK|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil has said in filings with the court that the wrongdoing was committed by people below him, who concealed their own misconduct from Weil.  He has also contended that the EBK investigation and decision exonerating Weil confirm that version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US-Recht in der Schweiz|url=http://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2014-26/us-recht-in-der-schweiz-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-262014.html|publisher=Die Weltwoche|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arraignment and Trial===

Charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in his appearance before the federal district court in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] on 16, December 2013, Weil was released on bail under house arrest with friends in New Jersey by US Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt.&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"/&gt; At his January 7, 2014 arraignment, Weil pleaded not-guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $20 billion in offshore assets.

The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014.&lt;ref name="Ex-UBS Executive Weil Acquitte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nesmith|first1=Susanah and David Voreacos|title=Ex-UBS Executive Weil Acquitted of U.S. Tax Conspiracy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-03/ex-ubs-executive-weil-acquitted-of-u-s-tax-conspiracy.html|website=BloombergBusiness.com|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurors deliberated just over an hour before returning a not guilty verdict. The acquittal is final as prosecution cannot appeal in this case.

'''Fábrica Nacional de Relógios, Reguladora, S. A.''' or simply '''Reguladora''' is a [[watch]] and [[clock]] manufacturing company, based in [[Vila Nova de Famalicão]], [[Portugal]]. Founded in 1892, Reguladora is the oldest watch manufacturing company in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Reguladora produces four ranges of watches: column clocks, table clocks, wall clocks and [[wristwatch]]es (including [[pocket watch]]es).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reguladora.com.pt/index.php  Reguladora presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reguladora was founded in 1892 in Famalicão, by José Gomes Carvalho. 

Beginning production with mechanical wall and table clocks, Reguladora expanded its range of products in the 1950s, with column clocks and alarm clocks.

After having been closed, the company was purchased by its employees, returning to production. 

Presently, Reguladora produces electronic watches and clocks, both for domestic and industrial application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4847">The '''Shubert family''' was responsible for the establishment of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] district, in [[New York City]], as the hub of the theatre industry in the [[United States]]. 

==History==
The family's American history began with Duvvid Schubart ([[Transliteration|transliterate]]d to "Shubert") and his wife Katrina (Gitel)  Helwitz, who left their native town [[Vladislavov]], Russian Empire (now [[Kudirkos Naumiestis]], [[Lithuania]]) arriving in New York City from Hamburg- through England - on June 12, 1881&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/hamburgpl_full/?name=_Schubert&amp;departure=1881-5-27&amp;departure_x=0-0-0&amp;name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry. com|last=1881 passenger list of the Schubert family|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the s/s ''Spain''  with their seven children. Later they settled in [[Syracuse, New York]].&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/shubert_bros.html "Shubert Brothers"] pbs.org, accessed August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=john&gt;Kenrick, John.[http://www.musicals101.com/who8.htm Who's Who in Musicals: Sa-Sm"] musicals101.com, accessed August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The three Shubert sons ([[Lee Shubert]], [[Sam S. Shubert]], and [[Jacob J. Shubert]]) had to forgo much in the way of formal education and go to work when they were very young. Introduced to the world of the theatre, the three brothers broke the monopoly on the theatre-management industry (represented by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]] under [[Abe Erlanger]]) and [[Mark Klaw]] in the foundation of rival agency [[the Shubert Organization]],&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=john/&gt; replacing it with their own.

Among the organization's [[Manhattan]] holdings are the renowned [[Winter Garden Theatre]] (at 1634 Broadway), the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Sam S. Shubert]] (at 221 West 44th Street), and the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatres]]. By 1924 they had 86 theatres in the United States. By 1953 they had produced 600 shows under their credits and had booked 1,000 shows into their numerous theatres.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; By the 1920s, they owned, operated, managed or booked over 1,000 theatres nationwide.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;[http://www.shubertorganization.com/theatres/default.asp "The Shubert Organization"] shubertorganization.com, accessed August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In 1942 they owned, leased or managed 20 of New York City's approximately 40 legitimate theatres and controlled some 15 in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Times Wire Services. "The Curtain Falls for J. J. Shubert", ''St. Petersburg Times'', December 27, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;As of 2009, the Shubert Organization owns seventeen Broadway theatres in New York City, as well as the Shubert Theatre in [[Boston]], the Forrest Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], and manages the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=organization/&gt; The organization also owns and operates the 5-stage Off-Broadway facility, [[New World Stages]].

{{chinese name|Tang (董)}}
'''Tang Choon Keng''' ({{zh|s=董俊竞|p=Dǒng Jùnjìng}}; 12 September 1901 – 3 September 2000) was a [[Singapore]]an entrepreneur, who founded [[Tangs]] [[department store]] in Singapore. He was popularly known as '''CK Tang'''. Tang has been credited for leading the way for the retail market in Singapore and establishing [[Orchard Road]] as a premier retail district in Singapore.

==Early life==
A [[Teochew people|Teochew]], Tang was born at the turn of the 20th century in [[Shantou]], China to a [[Presbyterian]] pastor. He [[emigrate]]d to the [[British colony]] of Singapore in 1923.

In Singapore, Tang began as a [[door-to-door]] salesman peddling hand-made Swatow [[lace]], [[embroidery]] and [[linen]] products. With a [[Renting|hire]]d [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]], Tang carried his goods in a pair of [[tin]] [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]]s which remained in his possession as a reminder of his humble beginnings. Tang later became known as the "Tin Trunk Man" and the "Curio King" for his [[rags to riches]] legacy.

==Establishment of Tangs==
[[File:Tangs department store, Singapore, photographed February 1969 × July 1971.jpg|thumb|Tangs department store, Singapore, photographed February 1969 × July 1971]]
In 1932, Tang was able to embark on a larger venture, having accumulated sufficient funds through hard work. He established a department store in 1932 with an initial [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of [[Straits dollar|S$]]3,000. Tang set up his first shop on the first floor of a building on [[River Valley Road]], selling [[craft]] products from China.

Subsequently in 1940, Tang financed the construction of a new building at the corner of [[Mohamed Sultan Road|Jalan Mohamed Sultan]] and River Valley Road to house a new department store. He called the new [[edifice]] ''Gainurn Building'', a variation of his father's name Tang Gan Urn. The department store sold a vast array of [[merchandise]]. By the 1950s, CK Tang had opened several more branches.

In 1958, Tang bought a 1,351-square metre piece of land at the corner of Orchard Road and [[Scotts Road]] at a cost of [[S$]]10,000 to further his vision of expanding his business. Although the site faced the Tai San Ting Cemetery, he felt that it had commercial value as many British housewives in the [[Tanglin]] area could stop by on their way to the [[Downtown Core|city]]. The decision was made against the advice of fellow businessmen who thought Orchard Road was unfashionable then. Years later, when the [[Singapore Government]] designated and developed Orchard Road as a prime shopping and tourist district, the price of land soared from S$3 per m² to S$6,000 per m².

With the acquired land plot, Tang constructed the landmark [[C.K. Tang Department Store]] (now rebranded as Tangs) at 310 Orchard Road at a cost of S$50,000. The building's green-[[tile]]d roof and facade was modelled after the [[Imperial Palace of the Forbidden City]] in Beijing. In 1960, Tang voluntarily closed the store due to problems with the trade unions, but Tangs was re-opened the following year. In 1975, Tang's company was [[Public company|publicly listed]]. 

[[File:Marriott Hotel 2, Singapore, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|[[Mariott Hotel (Singapore)|Marriott Hotel, Singapore]] (formerly the [[Dynasty Hotel]]) and Tang Plaza were built in 1982 to expand Tang Choon Keng's business on [[Orchard Road]].]]
In the late 1970s, Tang expanded his business again when he decided to develop the neighbouring [[property]] lots which he had bought years before. In 1982, the building on Orchard Road was [[demolish]]ed to make way for the new Tang complex, comprising the 33-storey deluxe [[Dynasty Hotel]] (now the [[Singapore Marriott Hotel]]) and the Tangs shopping complex (now Tang Plaza). The shopping complex consists of five floors of retail space covering more than 15,000 m², [[Marketing|marketed]] under the [[slogan]] "All The Best Under One Roof".

In 1991, Tangs opened its first overseas branch in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. Tang also collaborated with Malaysia's Mayang Sari Bhd to develop real estate, hotels and commercial properties in Kuala Lumpur. He also assisted the [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]] in its retail business in Malaysia.

Until 1996, Tangs was the only major shopping centre in Singapore to not operate on Sundays, in deference to Tang's Christian faith. Tang instituted the policy so that his family and Christian staff could attend [[Church service|church]] on Sundays. As a staunch Christian, Tang spoke of [[honesty]] and hard work as his guiding [[principle]]s.

Tang's distinctive management philosophy was the focus on people, both customers and staff. Emphasis was given to quality of the staff, reasonable [[pricing]] and warm [[Customer service|service]]. Tang believed in [[invest]]ing in his staff, as his frontline staff would be the ones who would be in direct contact with the customers and he believed that the [[Reputation|image]] of the store depended on them. As a result, Tang reserved a substantial annual [[budget]] for staff [[training]], which included tailored programs for sales staff, [[supervisor]]s and management. Supervisors and [[Management|managers]] were expected to undergo a minimum 100 hours of training. Tang also made an effort to get in touch with his staff at all levels, in order understand his customers' expectations on product and service quality. Despite the company's poor financial results in certain years, Tangs retained its reputation for good service and reliability.

Tang retired in 1987, handing the reins of [[corporate]] leadership to the second of his three sons, [[Tang Wee Sung]]. Tang retained the post of company president and was rarely out of touch with company business, personally checking the company's [[account (accountancy)|accounts]] and meeting suppliers.

== Personal life ==
Besides CK Tang, Tang Choon Keng was also known as Tang Un Tien. 

In 1960, Tang was [[kidnap]]ped by four armed thugs, but was freed unharmed within 84 hours after the family reportedly paid S$150,000 in [[ransom]].

Tang's first wife died in 1980; he subsequently remarried.  Tang had eight children. On 3 September 2000, Tang died peacefully at home with his family around him at 98 years old.

== Death ==
Tang died on 3 September 2000 in Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1884">The '''tradable sector''' of a country's [[economy]] is made up of the [[industry sector]]s whose output in terms of [[goods and services]] are [[International trade|traded internationally]], or could be traded internationally given a plausible variation in relative prices. Most commonly, the tradable sector consists largely of sectors of the [[manufacturing industry]], while the non-tradable sector consists of locally-rendered [[service (economics)|services]], including health, education, retail and construction.&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature Article - Australia's Tradable Sector|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/35b008afa1aa680fca256fd90018897f!OpenDocument|work=Australian Economic Indicators|accessdate=2011-09-19|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61oKxRaY6|archivedate=2011-09-19|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradable jobs can be performed by individuals outside a country: manufacturing, consulting, engineering, finance. Non-tradable jobs can realistically only be performed by domestic workforce: government, health care, hospitality, food service, education, retail, and construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Daniel|title=Nobel Laureate Spence: U.S. May Have to Live with Slow Employment Growth|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/nobeal-laureate-spence-u-may-live-slow-employment-144754933.html|publisher=Yahoo!

==Australia==
In 1990, Australia's sectoral outputs were 25.8% tradable and 74.2% non-tradable. Mining and manufacturing accounted for 18.3% and 61.4%, respectively, of the tradable sector.&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9833">The '''Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy''' ('''UDRP''') is a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) for the resolution of disputes regarding the registration of internet [[domain names]].  The UDRP currently applies to all [[Generic top-level domain|generic top level domains]] ([[.com]], [[.net]], [[.org]], etc...),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/ ICANN – Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policies]&lt;/ref&gt; some [[country code top-level domains]], and some older top level domains in specific circumstances.

==Historical background==
When ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was "The Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;See US Government White Paper http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements/white-paper&lt;/ref&gt; the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner's consent.  By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled.  In the United Kingdom, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] described such domain names as "an instrument of fraud".&lt;ref&gt;British Telecommunications plc v One in a Million Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 903, [[Aldous LJ]] at 920.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of ICANN's first steps was to commission the United Nations [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to produce a report on the conflict between trademarks and domain names.  Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report&lt;ref&gt;The Management of Internet Names and Addresses: Intellectual Property Issues, 30 April 1999. http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/amc/en/docs/report-final1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; recommended the establishment of a "mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations", which would allow for a "neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature."  The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.  It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that "each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party&lt;ref&gt;See WIPO Mandatory Uniform UDRP Administrative Dispute Procedure. http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/processes/process1/report/finalreport.html#IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The WIPO Report sets out the now familiar three stage test of the UDRP.

Following adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was ''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman'', involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/1999/d1999-0001.html WIPO Domain Name Decision: D1999-0001]. Wipo.int. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Providers of the UDRP are:

* [http://www.adndrc.org/mten/index.php The Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC)]
* [http://domains.adrforum.com/ National Arbitration Forum (NAF)]
* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)
* [http://www.adr.eu/index.php Czech Arbitration Court, Arbitration Center for Internet Disputes]
* [http://acdr.aipmas.org/default.aspx The Arab Center for Dispute Resolution (ACDR)]

===How it is made mandatory===
When a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must "represent and warrant", among other things, that registering the name "will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party", and agree to participate in an [[arbitration]]-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Process==
A complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed:

* The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a  [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] in which the complainant has rights; 
* The registrant does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and 
* The domain name has been registered and the domain name is being used in "[[bad faith]]".

In a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as:

* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark;
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, if the domain name owner has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; and 
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or 
* Whether by using the domain name, the registrant has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to the registrant's website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark.

The goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge. The costs to hire a UDRP provider to handle a complaint often start around [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 to $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = InterNIC &amp;#124; FAQs on the UDRP
 | url = http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html
 | accessdate = 2009-10-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law.  For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]]. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybersquatting.com An Informational Website About Cybersquatting Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The UDRP process has already been used in a number of well-known cases, such as [http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-0847.html ''Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and "Madonna.com"'']. In this case, the arbitration panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna.

Often there is contention over similar but not identical domain names, in which the offended party files a court action claiming [[trademark]] or [[copyright infringement]]. For example, actor [[Robert De Niro]] has claimed ownership of all domain names incorporating the text "[[Tribeca]]" for domain names with any content related to film festivals. In particular, he has a dispute with the owner of the website http://tribeca.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cinematical.com/2007/01/02/robert-de-niro-raging-bully/ | title = Robert De Niro: Raging Bully? | date = 2 January 2007 | last = Davis | first = Erik | website = Cinematical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |title=I am Tribeca, De Niro claims |date=31 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403050416/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name disputes under new gTLDs==
In 2012, ICANN launched a process to create [[.events|new generic top-level domains]]. Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms.  Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective.  Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a "substantial increase in cybersquatting".&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg BNA, Cyberlaw Predictions 2013, http://www.bna.com/cyberlaw-predictions-2013-b17179871639/&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).&lt;ref&gt;"Previous expansions of the namespace have failed to capture the public imagination or to pose a competitive threat to the gorilla in the market, .com.  According to WIPO, of 42,000 UDRP filings to date, 80% were for .com domains, and of the new gTLDs, only .info has attracted any volume of UDRP disputes (3% of cases filed)." http://www.emilytaylor.eu/2013/01/online-brand-protection-what-to-expect.html#.UQqKlL9Wx8E&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}

A '''vice president''' (in British English: '''vice-president''' for governments and '''[[Director (business)|director]]''' for businesses) is an [[Corporate officer|officer]] in [[government]] or [[business]] who is below a [[President (corporate title)|president]] (managing director) in rank. It can also refer to executive vice presidents, signifying that the vice president is on the executive branch of the government, university or company. The name comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[List of Latin phrases (S-Z)#vice|vice]]'' meaning "in place of".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vice- "vice"], etymologyonlive.com&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the vice president is called the ''deputy president''. In everyday speech, the abbreviation ''VP'' can be used.

==In government==
{{see also|List of current vice presidents}}

In [[government]], a vice president is a person whose primary responsibility is to act in place of the [[president]] on the event of the president's death, resignation or incapacity. Vice presidents are either elected jointly with the president as their [[running mate]], or more rarely, appointed independently after the president's election.

Most governments with vice presidents have one person in this role at any time, although in some countries there are two or more vice presidents–an extreme case being Iran's [[Vice President of Iran|12 vice presidents]]. If the president is not present, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to fulfill their duties, the vice president will generally serve as president. In many [[presidential system]]s, the vice president does not wield much day-to-day political power, but is still considered an important member of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Several vice presidents in the [[Americas]] hold the position of [[President of the Senate]]; this is the case, for example, in [[Argentina]], the [[United States]], and [[Uruguay]]. The vice president sometimes assumes some of the ceremonial duties of the president, such as attending functions and events that the actual president may be too busy to attend; the [[Vice President of the United States]], for example, often attends funerals of world leaders on behalf of the [[President of the United States|president]]. In parliamentary or semi-presidential systems, a Vice President may coexist with a Prime Minister, as is the case in [[Vice President of India|India]] and [[Vice President of Namibia|Namibia]], but the presence of both offices concurrently is rare.

{{further|Director (business)}}
In [[business]], "vice president" refers to hierarchical position that ranges from extremely senior positions directly reporting to C-level executives (in non-financial companies), to junior non-management positions with 4-10 years of experience (in financial companies).

In non-financial businesses, vice presidents often report directly to the [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company and is a member of the executive management team. Some [[corporations]] that use this [[Corporate title|term]] may have individuals with the title of vice president responsible for specific business divisions (''e.g.'', Vice President for Legal, Vice President for Sales and Marketing, Vice President for Finance, or Vice President for Human Resources). 

When there are several vice presidents in a company, these individuals are sometimes differentiated with titles denoting higher positions such as executive vice president and/or senior vice president with the remaining management team holding the title vice president. The title of assistant vice president or associate vice president is used in large organizations below vice president and there can be a very convoluted list of other types of VPs as seen in the next section. 

As many of these VPs have minimal employees reporting to them, their necessity has been questioned, with for example [[Inc Magazine]] arguing to flatten the corporate hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/the-world-isnt-flat-but-companies-should-be.html|title=3 Reasons to Eliminate Hierarchy in Your Company|date=21 November 2013|website=Inc.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, as [[universities]] have adopted a corporate structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Slow-Death-of-the/228991|title=The Slow Death of the University|date=6 April 2015|website=Chronicle.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is concern over administrative bloat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/research-scores-of-us-top-brass-fail-to-shine|title=Research scores of US top brass fail to shine|date=20 July 2016|website=Timeshighereducation.com\accessdate=30 may 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over paying VPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13583883.2016.1181198|title=Are you overpaying your academic executive team? A method for detecting unmerited academic executive compensation|journal=Tertiary Education and Management|volume=22|date=2016|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have even claimed the proliferation of VPs and other administrators is destroying universities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg]]. The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters (2011) Oxford University Press &lt;/ref&gt; "Corporate vice president" is an older term that usually denotes a vice president that is named as a corporate officer by the board of directors.  Not all vice presidents in a company in the modern business environment are named as an official corporate officer.{{fact|date=June 2015}}

===Hierarchy of vice presidents===
Depending on the specific organization, the following may be an example of the hierarchy of the vice presidents:

*Senior Executive Vice President (Sr. EVP, SEVP)
*First Executive Vice President (1EVP or FEVP)
*Executive Vice President (EVP)
*Senior Vice President (SVP)
*Vice President (VP)
*Additional Vice President (AVP) 
*Assistant Vice President (Asst. VP)
*Joint Vice President (Jt. VP) 
*Associate Vice President 
*Junior Vice President (Jr. VP)

This comparison is not strictly correct, as "director" is a legal term, meaning someone registered with the relevant country's company registrar (or simply named in the legal documents, for countries not having company registration) as having managerial control of the company, and having legal responsibility for its operation, whilst a vice president does not. In either case the responsibilities may be overall to the company, a region (US, EMEA, CEE...), business unit or function such as Sales, Marketing, IT etc.

===Use in financial services companies===
In [[brokerage firm]]s, [[Investment banking|investment banks]] and other financial companies, "vice president" is a seniority rank rather than denoting an actual managerial position within the company. It is a relatively junior position, usually does not denote managerial responsibilities and companies have a large number of ''vice presidents'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16423358 According to The Economist], on the website LinkedIn, the title of vice-president grew 426% faster than website membership growth, from 2005 to 2009&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as an inexpensive way for a company to recognize employees, or perhaps because of [[delayering]] when an employee can't be moved higher in the organization but still deserves recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acc.com/legalresources/quickcounsel/lpjtii.cfm|title=The Legal Pitfalls of Job Title Inflation (Part I): Apparent Authority and Employee Misclassification|publisher=Association of Corporate Counsel|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, the title merely implies that someone is in a medium-seniority individual contributor role.

==Usage in other organizations==
In other organizations (''e.g.'', [[trade union]]s, societies, clubs) one or multiple vice presidents are elected by the members of the organization. When multiple vice presidents are elected, the positions are usually numbered to prevent confusion as to who may preside or succeed to the office of president upon vacancy of that office (for example: 1st vice president, 2nd vice president, and so on).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 457-458|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases vice presidents are given titles due to their specific responsibilities, for example: Vice President of Operations, Finance, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some associations the first vice president can be interchangeable with executive vice president and the remaining vice presidents are ranked in order of their seniority.

The primary responsibility of the vice president of a club or organization is to be prepared to assume the powers and duties of the office of the president in the case of a vacancy in that office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the office of President becomes vacant, the vice president (or in clubs with multiple vice presidents, the VP that occupies the highest-ranking office), will assume the office of president, with the lower vice presidents to fill in the remaining vice presidencies, leaving the lowest vice presidency to be filled by either election or appointment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the bylaws of a club specifically provide of the Officer title of [[President-Elect]], that officer would assume the powers and duties of the president upon vacancy of that office only if specified in the bylaws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''work at home parent''' is an [[entrepreneur]] who works from [[home]] and integrates [[parenting]] into his or her business activities. They are sometimes referred to as a WAHM (work at home mom) or a WAHD (work at home dad).

Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating [[commuting]], or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for [[childcare]] outside the home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://workathomemoms.about.com/od/childcare/a/childcaretypes.htm|title=7 Ways to Take Charge of Child Care|last=Duncan|first=Apryl|date=August 23, 2016|work=The Spruce|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; others integrate child rearing into their [[Working time|work day]] and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.

Many WAHPs start [[Home business|home-based businesses]] in order to care for their children while still creating [[income]]. The desire to care for one's own children, the incompatibility of a [[Working time#9-to-5|9-to-5]] work day with school hours or sick days, and the expense of childcare prompt many parents to change or leave their jobs in the [[workforce]] to be available to their children. Many WAHPs build a business schedule that can be integrated with their parenting duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.workhomelife.com.au/become-work-home-parent/|title=Why become a Work at Home Parent? - Work / Home / Life|last=Gourlay|first=Sharon|date=2014-10-28|work=Work / Home / Life|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrating Business and Parenting ==
An integration of parenting and business can take place in one or more of four key ways: combined uses of time, combined uses of space, normalizing children in business, and flexibility.

Combining uses of time involves some level of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]], such as taking children on business errands, and the organized scheduling of business activities during child’s down times and vice versa. The WAHP combines uses of space by creating a home (or mobile) office that accommodates the child's presence.

Normalizing acknowledges the child’s presence in the business environment. This can include letting key business partners know that parenting is a priority, establishing routines and rules for children in the office, and even having children help with business when appropriate.

Finally, the WAHP can utilize the inherent flexibility of the work-at-home arrangement. This may mean working in smaller increments of time instead of long stretches, looser scheduling of the day’s activities to allow for the unexpected, and working at non-traditional times.

A business that demands 9-to-5 business hours, a polished office, intense one-on-one time with clients, dangerous materials, or impromptu appointments may not work well for a parent with children at home. Thus, not all professions lend themselves to work-at-home parenting.  Without good organization, the WAHP may experience decreased productivity due to added responsibilities and unexpected interruptions.  Internet businesses or 'virtual assistants' are well-suited as work-at-home businesses.

The Center for Women's Business Research, a non-profit organization, found that [[Generation X]] mothers are the most likely to work from home. The center also reports that between 1997 and 2004, employment at female-owned companies grew by 24.2%, more than twice the rate of the 11.6% logged by all businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-05-03/working-moms-tear-down-office-walls|title=Working Moms Tear Down Office Walls|last=Gogoi|first=Pallavi|date=2005-05-04|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of businesses that WAHPs may engage in include [[telecommuting]] for corporations, freelancing on project such as articles, graphic design or consulting, or working as an independent contractor, running home-party businesses, managing complete companies from home, and providing valuable business and marketing support.

== History ==
The concept of the WAHP has been around for as long as [[guild|small businesses]] have.  In [[pre-industrial]] societies, [[merchant]]s and [[artisan]]s often worked out of or close to their homes. Children typically remained in the care of a parent during the day and were often present while the parents worked. Societal changes in the 1800s, such as [[compulsory education]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], made working from home with children around less common.

[[Entrepreneurship]] saw a resurgence in the 1980s, with more of an emphasis on [[work-life balance]].  Among the long-traditional groups of WAHPs are those professionals in private practice with home offices such as physicians, therapists, music teachers and tutors. The term WAHP began gaining popularity in the late 1990s especially as the growth of the Internet allowed for small business owners and entrepreneurs to have greater options for starting and running their businesses. By 2004, over 20 million people worked at home at least part-time (either as business owners or in a formal arrangement with their employer), many of whom were parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/homey.nr0.htm|title=Work At Home Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=Division of Labor Statistics|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a digital magazine was established by a WAHM with a decade of experience in the publications field specifically for work-at-home parents. The [[WAHM (magazine)|WAHM Magazine]] was designed to address the issues of the complete lifestyle of work-at-home parents regardless of field or industry, and has a mission to validate, empower, encourage, educate and support WAHPs in their personal, professional and lifestyle goals. And the end of the first decade of the 21st century, [[telecommuting]] is becoming a greater option for companies and employees alike for a variety of economic and environmental concerns.
