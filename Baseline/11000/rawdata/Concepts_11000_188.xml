      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''Abraham Lincoln School for Social Science''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] was a "broad,
nonpartisan school for workers, writers, and their sympathizers," aimed at the thousands of [[African-American]] workers who had migrated to Chicago from the [[American South]] during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/marxism-thaxis%40lists.econ.utah.edu/msg00940.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4332552 |author=P. Magg |volume=6 |number=4 |date=Autumn 1944 |pages=632–644 |work=The Kenyon Review |title=Education for the Age of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional history==

The Abraham Lincoln School for Social Science was founded by prominent civil rights activist and attorney [[William L. Patterson]], who had organized the defense of the [[Scottsboro Boys]].

The Lincoln School was among the first to offer a [[jazz]] history course, taught by [[Frank Marshall Davis]], in 1945.  In April 1947, it sponsored “Chicago Salutes Paul Robeson” at the Civic Opera House, where Lena Horne and others paid tribute to famed singer and civil rights activist [[Paul Robeson]].  Robeson's outspoken support of civil rights and the labor movement, and criticism of American foreign policy, had led to government scrutiny and resulting in his [[blacklisting]] by many concert halls.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayarearobeson.org/Chronology_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, the school was accused of being an adjunct of the [[Communist Party USA]] by Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] in December 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General Tom Clark, letter to Loyalty Review Board, released December 4, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; again in the 1948 by the [[California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities]]&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Report Un-American Activities in California 1948, page 95, titled 'Abraham Lincoln School'&lt;/ref&gt; and a target of [[HUAC]] during the years leading up to [[McCarthy Era]].&lt;ref&gt;United States.

Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty members included Morris Backall, Michael Baker, [[Frank Marshall Davis]], [[Horace Davis]], David Englestein, Morton Goldsholl, Pat Hoverder, [[Alfonso Iannelli]], Leon Katzen, Ludwig Kruhe, Herschel Meyer, Henry Noyes, [[William L. Patterson]], Fred Ptashne, Eleanore Redwin, Boris M. Revsine, Frank Sokolik, William Rose, Herman Schendel, [[Bernice Targ]], and Morris Topchevsky. A notice appearing in a catalog of the school stated that "prominent citizens participating in our efforts" include [[Paul Robeson]], [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Lee Pressman]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Albert E. Kahn]], and [[Henrietta Buckmaster]].

The '''bypass ratio (BPR)''' of a [[turbofan]] engine is the ratio between the mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/technology/bypass-ratio&lt;/ref&gt; A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10&amp;nbsp;kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1&amp;nbsp;kg of air passing through the core.

Turbofan engines are usually described in terms of bpr, which together with [[engine pressure ratio]], turbine inlet temperature and fan pressure ratio are important design parameters. In addition bpr is quoted for [[turboprop]] and [[unducted fan]] installations because their high propulsive efficiency gives them the overall efficiency characteristics of very high bypass turbofans. This allows them to be shown together with turbofans on plots which show trends of reducing sfc (specific fuel consumption) with increasing bpr. Bpr is also quoted for lift fan installations where the fan airflow is remote from the engine and doesn't physically touch the engine core.

Bypass provides a lower fuel consumption for the same thrust, measured as [[thrust specific fuel consumption]] (grams/second fuel per unit of thrust in kN using [[SI units]]). Lower fuel consumption that comes with high bypass ratios applies to [[turboprop]]s, using a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]] rather than a ducted fan.&lt;ref name=kroo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spak/&gt;&lt;ref name=nag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animatedengines.com/jets.html Animated Engines]&lt;/ref&gt; High bypass designs are the dominant type for commercial passenger aircraft and both civilian and military jet transports.

Business jets use medium bpr engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abcm.org.br/anais/cobem/2013/PDF/1874.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516163516/http://www.abcm.org.br/anais/cobem/2013/PDF/1874.pdf# |archive-date=2017-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat aircraft use engines with '''low bypass''' ratios to compromise between fuel economy and the requirements of combat: high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, supersonic performance, and the ability to use [[afterburners]].

==Principles==
If all the gas power from a gas turbine is converted to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate big mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine's own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The first jet aircraft were subsonic and the poor suitability of the propelling nozzle for these speeds due to high fuel consumption was understood, and bypass proposed, as early as 1936 (U.K. Patent 471,368).  
The underlying principle behind bypass is trading exhaust velocity for extra mass flow which still gives the required thrust but uses less fuel. [[Frank Whittle]] called it "gearing down the flow".&lt;ref&gt;Gas Turbine Aerodynamics, Sir Frank Whittle, Pergamon Press 1981, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Power is transferred from the gas generator to an extra mass of air, i.e. a bigger diameter propelling jet, moving more slowly. The bypass spreads the available mechanical power across more air to reduce the velocity of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft Engine Design Second Edition, Mattingley, Heiser, Pratt, AIAA Education Series, {{ISBN|1-56347-538-3}}, p.539&lt;/ref&gt; The trade off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing disc loading and power loading.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202596.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor.

Bypass usually refers to transferring gas power from a gas turbine to a bypass stream of air to reduce fuel consumption and jet noise. Alternatively, there may be a requirement for an afterburning engine where the sole requirement for bypass is to provide cooling air. This sets the lower limit for bpr and these engines have been called "leaky" or continuous bleed turbojets&lt;ref&gt;Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1975-1976, edited by John W.R. Taylor, Jane's Yearbooks, Paulton House, 8 Sheperdess Walk, London N1 7LW, p.748&lt;/ref&gt; (General Electric YJ-101 bpr 0.25) and low bpr turbojets&lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2275853&lt;/ref&gt; (Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120). Low bpr (0.2) has also been used to provide surge margin as well as afterburner cooling for the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney J58]].&lt;ref&gt;http://roadrunnersinternationale.com/pw_tales.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Gas turbine efficiency.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations]]

In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine the high temperature and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a [[propelling nozzle]] and  produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power produced by the turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a [[ducted fan]] that accelerates air rearward from the front of the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to [[turboprop]]s in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between [[turbojet]]s, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less).&lt;ref name=srm&gt;"[http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/turbofan-2012.pdf The turbofan engine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418181832/http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/turbofan-2012.pdf# |date=2015-04-18 }}", page 7. ''[[SRM Institute of Science and Technology]], Department of aerospace engineering''&lt;/ref&gt; Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss propelling nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;Gas Turbine Theory Second Edition, Cohen, Rogers and Saravanamuttoo, Longmans Group Limited 1972, {{ISBN|0 582 44927 8}}, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.

To see the influence of increasing bpr alone on overall efficiency in the aircraft, i.e. sfc, a common gas generator has to be used, i.e. no change in Brayton cycle parameters or component efficiencies. Bennett&lt;ref&gt;Aero Engine Development for the Future, H.W. Bennett, Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 197A, Power Industries Division, July 1983, Fig.5&lt;/ref&gt; shows in this case a relatively slow rise in losses transferring power to the bypass at the same time as a fast drop in exhaust losses with a significant improvement in sfc. In reality increases in bpr over time come along with rises in gas generator efficiency masking, to some extent, the influence of bpr.

Only the limitations of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the [[compression ratio]] of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high [[propulsive efficiency]] because even slightly increasing the velocity of a very large volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities.&lt;ref name=bevil&gt;[[Paul Bevilaqua]] : [http://www.dtic.mil/dticasd/sbir/sbir032/n184.doc The shaft driven Lift Fan propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter] page 3.

Quote: "It has better fuel consumption than a turbojet or turbofan, due to a high propulsive efficiency.., achieving thrust by a high mass flow of air from the propeller at low jet velocity. Above 0.6 Mach number the turboprop in turn becomes uncompetitive, due mainly to higher weight and frontal area."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls–Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Conway|Conway]] [[turbofan]] engine, developed in the early 1950s, was an early example of a bypass engine. The configuration was similar to a 2-spool turbojet but to make it into a bypass engine it was equipped with an oversized low pressure compressor: the flow through the inner portion of the compressor blades went into the core while the outer portion of the blades blew air around the core to provide the rest of the thrust. The bypass ratio for the Conway varied between 0.3 and 0.6 depending on the variant&lt;ref&gt;"Rolls-Royce Aero Engines" Bill Gunston, Patrick Stevens Limited, {{ISBN|1-85260-037-3}}, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of bypass ratios during the 1960s gave [[Jet airliner|jetliners]] fuel efficiency that could compete with that of piston-powered planes.
Today (2015), most jet engines have some bypass. Modern engines in slower aircraft, such as airliners, have bypass ratios up to 12:1; in higher-speed aircraft, such as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], bypass ratios are much lower, around 1.5; and craft designed for speeds up to Mach 2 and somewhat above have bypass ratios below 0.5.

[[Turboprop]]s have bypass ratios of 50-100,&lt;ref name=kroo&gt;Ilan Kroo and Juan Alonso.

Quote: "When the bypass ratio is increased to 10-20 for very efficient low speed performance, the weight and wetted area of the fan shroud (inlet) become large, and at some point it makes sense to eliminate it altogether. The fan then becomes a propeller and the engine is called a turboprop. Turboprop engines provide efficient power from low speeds up to as high as M=0.8 with bypass ratios of 50-100."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spak&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/people/spakovszky.html Prof. Z.

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

'''Classical mechanics''' describes the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[Projectile|projectiles]] to parts of [[Machine (mechanical)|machinery]], and [[astronomical objects]],  such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[Star|stars]] and [[galaxies]]. 

If the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the [[Physical law|laws]] of classical mechanics how it will move in the future (determinism) and how it has moved in the past (reversibility).

The earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others in the 17th century to describe the motion of [[Physical body|bodies]] under the influence of a system of [[Force|forces]].

Later, more abstract methods were developed, leading to the reformulations of classical mechanics known as [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extend substantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of [[analytical mechanics]]. They are, with some modification, also used in all areas of modern physics.

Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely massive and speeds not approaching the [[speed of light]]. When the objects being examined have about the size of an atom diameter, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of [[mechanics]]: [[quantum mechanics]]. To describe velocities that are not small compared to the speed of light, [[special relativity]] is needed. In case that objects become extremely massive,  [[general relativity]] becomes applicable. However, a number of modern sources do include relativistic mechanics into classical physics, which in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and accurate form.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The notion of "classical" may be somewhat confusing, since this term usually refers to the era of [[classical antiquity]] in [[European history]]. While many discoveries within the [[mathematics]] of that period are applicable today and of great use, much of the science that emerged from that time has since been superseded by more accurate models. This in no way detracts from the science of that time as most of modern physics is built directly upon those developments. The emergence of classical mechanics was a decisive stage in the development of [[science]], in the modern sense of the term. Above all, it is characterized by an insistence that more rigor be used to describe the behavior of bodies. Such an exacting foundation is only available through [[mathematical]] treatment and reliance on [[experiment]], rather than [[speculative reason|speculation]]. Classical mechanics established a way to predict the behavior of objects in a quantitative manner and ways to test these predictions through carefully designed [[measurement]]. The emerging globally cooperative endeavor provided increased scrutiny and testing of both theory and experiment. This remains a key factor in establishing certainty in knowledge and in bringing it to the service of society. History shows how closely the health and wealth of a society depend on nurturing this investigative and critical approach.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This view seems very useful as an aside note, as in "for further information". --&gt;

==Description of the theory==
[[File:Tir parabòlic.svg|thumb|alt=diagram of parabolic projectile motion|The analysis of projectile motion is a part of classical mechanics.]]
The following introduces the basic concepts of classical mechanics. For simplicity, it often models real-world objects as [[point particle]]s (objects with negligible size). The motion of a point particle is characterized by a small number of [[parameter]]s: its position, [[mass]], and the [[force]]s applied to it. Each of these parameters is discussed in turn.

In reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a [[0 (number)|non-zero]] size. (The physics of ''very'' small particles, such as the [[electron]], is more accurately described by [[quantum mechanics]].) Objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles, because of the additional [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], e.g., a [[baseball]] can [[rotation|spin]] while it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as [[wikt:composite|composite]] objects, made of a large number of collectively acting point particles. The [[center of mass]] of a composite object behaves like a point particle.

Classical mechanics uses [[common-sense]] notions of how matter and forces exist and interact. It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also [[Action at a distance]]).

The ''position'' of a [[point particle]] is defined in relation to a [[coordinate system]] centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in [[space]] called the origin ''O''. A simple coordinate system might describe the position of a [[particle]] ''P'' with a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] notated by an arrow labeled '''r''' that points from the origin ''O'' to point ''P''. In general, the point particle does not need to be stationary relative to ''O''.  In cases where ''P'' is moving relative to ''O'', '''r''' is defined as a function of ''t'', [[time]]. In pre-Einstein relativity (known as [[Galilean relativity]]), time is considered an absolute, i.e., the [[time interval]] that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to relying on [[absolute time]], classical mechanics assumes [[Euclidean geometry]] for the structure of space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-fall-2003/lecture-notes/binder1.pdf MIT physics 8.01 lecture notes (page 12)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130709154423/http%3A//ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8%2D01%2Dphysics%2Di%2Dfall%2D2003/lecture%2Dnotes/binder1.pdf |date=2013-07-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Velocity and speed====
{{Main|Velocity|speed}}
The ''[[velocity]]'', or the [[calculus|rate of change]] of position with time, is defined as the [[derivative]] of the position with respect to time:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \over \mathrm{d}t}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

In classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For example, if one car travels east at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h and passes another car traveling in the same direction at 50&amp;nbsp;km/h, the slower car perceives the faster car as traveling east at {{nowrap|60 − 50 {{=}} 10 km/h}}. However, from the perspective of the faster car, the slower car is moving 10&amp;nbsp;km/h to the west, often denoted as -10&amp;nbsp;km/h where the sign implies opposite direction. Velocities are directly additive as [[Wikibooks:Physics with Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar and Vector Quantities|vector quantities]]; they must be dealt with using [[vector analysis]].

Mathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''u'''''d'''}} and the velocity of the second object by the vector {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} ''v'''''e'''}}, where ''u'' is the speed of the first object, ''v'' is the speed of the second object, and '''d''' and '''e''' are [[unit vector]]s in the directions of motion of each object respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the first object sees the velocity of the second object as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v'}= \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

When both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be simplified to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = ( u - v ) \mathbf{d} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Or, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:
:&lt;math&gt;u' = u - v \, .&lt;/math&gt;

====Acceleration====
{{Main|Acceleration}}
The ''[[acceleration]]'', or rate of change of velocity, is the [[derivative]] of the velocity with respect to time (the [[derivative|second derivative]] of the position with respect to time):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \over \mathrm{d}t} = {\mathrm{d^2}\mathbf{r} \over \mathrm{d}t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time.  Velocity can change in either magnitude or direction, or both. Occasionally, a decrease in the magnitude of velocity "''v''" is referred to as ''deceleration'', but generally any change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is simply referred to as acceleration.

====Frames of reference====
{{Main|Inertial frame of reference|Galilean transformation}}
While the position, velocity and acceleration of a [[particle]] can be described with respect to any [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] in any state of motion, classical mechanics assumes the existence of a special family of [[frame of reference|reference frames]] in which the mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form. These special reference frames are called [[inertial frames]]. 

An inertial frame is a frame of reference within which an object interacting with no forces (an idealized situation) appears either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an inertial frame. These are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observer's [[physical law]]s{{clarify|date=October 2013}} originate from identifiable sources caused by [[field (physics)|fields]], such as electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges), gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth.

A key concept of inertial frames is the method for identifying them. For practical purposes, reference frames that do not accelerate with respect to [[star|distant stars]] (an extremely distant point) are regarded as good approximations to inertial frames. [[Non-inertial reference frame]]s accelerate in relation to an existing inertial frame. They form the basis for Einstein's relativity.  Due to the relative motion, particles in the non-inertial frame appear to move in ways not explained by forces from existing fields in the reference frame. Hence, it appears that there are other forces that enter the equations of motion solely as a result of the relative acceleration. These forces are referred to as [[fictitious force]]s, inertia forces, or pseudo-forces.  

Consider two [[reference frames]] ''S'' and &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt;. For observers in each of the reference frames an event has space-time coordinates of (''x'',''y'',''z'',''t'') in frame ''S'' and (&lt;var&gt;x'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;y'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;z'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;t'&lt;/var&gt;) in frame &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt;. Assuming time is measured the same in all reference frames, and if we require {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &lt;var&gt;x'&lt;/var&gt;}} when {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, then the relation between the space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt; and ''S'', which are moving at a relative velocity of ''u'' in the ''x'' direction is:
:&lt;math&gt;x' = x - u t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = t \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This set of formulas defines a [[group transformation]] known as the [[Galilean transformation]] (informally, the ''Galilean transform''). This group is a limiting case of the [[Poincaré group]] used in [[special relativity]]. The limiting case applies when the velocity ''u'' is very small compared to ''c'', the [[speed of light]].

The transformations have the following consequences:
*'''v'''′ = '''v''' − '''u''' (the velocity '''v'''′ of a particle from the perspective of ''S''′ is slower by '''u''' than its velocity '''v''' from the perspective of ''S'')
*'''a'''′ = '''a''' (the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*'''F'''′ = '''F''' (the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*the  [[speed of light]] is not a constant in classical mechanics, nor does the special position given to the speed of light in [[relativistic mechanics]] have a counterpart in classical mechanics.

For some problems, it is convenient to use rotating coordinates (reference frames). Thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame, or introduce additionally a fictitious [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]].

===Forces; Newton's second law===
{{Main|Force|Newton's laws of motion}}
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] was the first to mathematically express the relationship between [[force]] and [[momentum]]. Some physicists interpret [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]] as a definition of force and mass, while others consider it a fundamental postulate, a law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornton|first1=Stephen T.|last2=Marion|first2=Jerry B.|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|date=2004|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-534-40896-1|pages=50|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either interpretation has the same mathematical consequences, historically known as "Newton's Second Law":
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p} \over \mathrm{d}t} = {\mathrm{d}(m \mathbf{v}) \over \mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity ''m'''''v''' is called the ([[canonical momentum|canonical]]) [[momentum]]. The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. Since the definition of acceleration is {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} d'''v'''/d''t''}}, the second law can be written in the simplified and more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

So long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an [[ordinary differential equation]], which is called the ''equation of motion''.

As an example, assume that friction is the only force acting on the particle, and that it may be modeled as a function of the velocity of the particle, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\rm R} = - \lambda \mathbf{v} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is a positive constant, the negative sign states that the force is opposite the sense of the velocity. Then the equation of motion is
:&lt;math&gt;- \lambda \mathbf{v} = m \mathbf{a} = m {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \over \mathrm{d}t} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This can be [[antiderivative|integrated]] to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_0 e^\frac{-\lambda t}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial velocity. This means that the velocity of this particle [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] to zero as time progresses. In this case, an equivalent viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction (which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the [[conservation of energy]]), and the particle is slowing down. This expression can be further integrated to obtain the position '''r''' of the particle as a function of time.

Important forces include the [[gravity|gravitational force]] and the [[Lorentz force]] for [[electromagnetism]]. In addition, [[Newton's third law]] can sometimes be used to deduce the forces acting on a particle: if it is known that particle ''A'' exerts a force '''F''' on another particle ''B'', it follows that ''B'' must exert an equal and opposite ''reaction force'', −'''F''', on ''A''. The strong form of Newton's third law requires that '''F''' and −'''F''' act along the line connecting ''A'' and ''B'', while the weak form does not. Illustrations of the weak form of Newton's third law are often found for magnetic forces.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}

===Work and energy===
{{Main|Work (physics)|kinetic energy|potential energy}}
If a constant force '''F''' is applied to a particle that makes a displacement Δ'''r''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The displacement Δ'''r''' is the difference of the particle's initial and final positions: Δ'''r''' = '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; − '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''work done'' by the force is defined as the [[scalar product]] of the force and displacement vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle moves from '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along a path ''C'', the work done on the particle is given by the [[line integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

If the work done in moving the particle from '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the same no matter what path is taken, the force is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. [[Gravity]] is a conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized [[Spring (device)|spring]], as given by [[Hooke's law]]. The force due to [[friction]] is non-conservative.

The [[kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of a particle of mass ''m'' travelling at speed ''v'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k} = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.

The [[work–energy theorem]] states that for a particle of constant mass ''m'', the total work ''W'' done on the particle as it moves from position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the change in [[kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of the particle:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta E_\mathrm{k} = E_\mathrm{k,2} - E_\mathrm{k,1} = \tfrac{1}{2}m\left(v_2^{\, 2} - v_1^{\, 2}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Conservative forces can be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function, known as the [[potential energy]] and denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = - \mathbf{\nabla} E_\mathrm{p} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

If all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the total potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies corresponding to each force
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = - \mathbf{\nabla} E_\mathrm{p} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = - \Delta E_\mathrm{p} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
 
The decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic energy
:&lt;math&gt;-\Delta E_\mathrm{p} = \Delta E_\mathrm{k} \Rightarrow \Delta (E_\mathrm{k} + E_\mathrm{p}) = 0 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is known as ''conservation of energy'' and states that the total [[energy]],
:&lt;math&gt;\sum E = E_\mathrm{k} + E_\mathrm{p} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

is constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered forces are conservative.

===Beyond Newton's laws===
Classical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-pointlike objects. [[Euler's laws]] provide extensions to Newton's laws in this area. The concepts of [[angular momentum]] rely on the same [[calculus]] used to describe one-dimensional motion. The [[rocket equation]] extends the notion of rate of change of an object's momentum to include the effects of an object "losing mass".

There are two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These, and other modern formulations, usually bypass the concept of "force", instead referring to other physical quantities, such as energy, speed and momentum, for describing mechanical systems in [[generalized coordinates]].

The expressions given above for momentum and kinetic energy are only valid when there is no significant electromagnetic contribution. In electromagnetism, Newton's second law for current-carrying wires breaks down unless one includes the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as expressed by the [[Poynting vector]] divided by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in free space.

==Limits of validity==
[[File:physicsdomains.svg|380px|thumb|alt=two by two chart of mechanics for size by speed|Domain of validity for Classical Mechanics]]
Many branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms; two of the most accurate being [[general relativity]] and relativistic [[statistical mechanics]]. [[Geometric optics]] is an approximation to the [[Quantum optics|quantum theory of light]], and does not have a superior "classical" form.

When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) is of use. QFT deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction. When treating large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, [[statistical mechanics]] becomes useful. Statistical mechanics describes the behavior of large (but countable) numbers of particles and their interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level. Statistical mechanics is mainly used in [[thermodynamics]] for systems that lie outside the bounds of the assumptions of classical thermodynamics. In the case of high [[velocity]] objects approaching the speed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by [[special relativity]]. In case that objects become extremely heavy (i.e. their [[Schwarzschild radius]] is not negligibly small for a given application), deviations from Newtonian mechanics become apparent and can be quantified by using the [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. In that case, [[General relativity]] (GR) becomes applicable. However, until now there is no theory of [[General relativity|Quantum gravity]] unifying GR and QFT in the sense that it could be used when objects become extremely small and heavy.[[Classical mechanics#cite note-Hamber 2009-4|[4]]][[Classical mechanics#cite note-5|[5]]]

===The Newtonian approximation to special relativity===
In special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{m \mathbf{v}}{ \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the particle's rest mass, '''v''' its velocity, ''v'' is the modulus of '''v''', and ''c'' is the speed of light.

If ''v'' is very small compared to ''c'', ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is approximately zero, and so
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \approx m\mathbf{v} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the Newtonian equation {{nowrap|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''v'''}} is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.

For example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a [[cyclotron]], [[gyrotron]], or high voltage [[magnetron]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f = f_\mathrm{c}\frac{m_0}{m_0 + T/c^2} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle) with kinetic energy ''T'' and ([[Invariant mass|rest]]) mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; circling in a magnetic field. The (rest) mass of an electron is 511&amp;nbsp;keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11&amp;nbsp;kV direct current accelerating voltage.

===The classical approximation to quantum mechanics===
The ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system. For non-relativistic particles, this wavelength is
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum.

Again, this happens with [[electrons]] before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] in 1927, accelerated by 54&amp;nbsp;V, had a wavelength of 0.167&amp;nbsp;nm, which was long enough to exhibit a single [[diffraction]] [[side lobe]] when reflecting from the face of a nickel [[crystal]] with atomic spacing of 0.215&amp;nbsp;nm. With a larger [[vacuum chamber]], it would seem relatively easy to increase the [[angular resolution]] from around a radian to a [[milliradian]] and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of [[integrated circuit]] computer memory.

More practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering scale are conduction by [[quantum tunneling]] in [[tunnel diode]]s and very narrow [[transistor]] [[gate (transistor)|gates]] in [[integrated circuit]]s.

Classical mechanics is the same extreme [[high frequency approximation]] as [[geometric optics]]. It is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with [[rest mass]]. These have more momentum and therefore shorter De Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same kinetic energies.

==History==
{{Main|History of classical mechanics}}
{{See also|Timeline of classical mechanics}}
The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in [[science]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]],

Some [[Greek philosophers]] of antiquity, among them [[Aristotle]], founder of [[Aristotelian physics]], may have been the first to maintain the idea that "everything happens for a reason" and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical [[theory]] and controlled [[experiment]], as we know it. These later became decisive factors in forming modern science, and their early application came to be known as classical mechanics.

In his ''Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum'', medieval mathematician [[Jordanus de Nemore]] introduced the concept of "positional [[gravity]]" and the use of component [[forces]].&lt;!--looks like Jagged misuse of sources: An early mathematical and experimental [[scientific method]] was introduced into [[Islamic science#Mechanics|mechanics]] in the 11th century by [[al-Biruni]], who along with [[al-Khazini]] in the 12th century, unified [[statics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] into the [[science]] of mechanics, and combined the fields of [[hydrostatics]] with dynamics to create the field of [[hydrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

The first published [[causal]] explanation of the motions of [[planets]] was Johannes Kepler's ''[[Astronomia nova]],'' published in 1609. He concluded, based on [[Tycho Brahe]]'s observations on the orbit of [[Mars]], that the planet's orbits were [[ellipse]]s. This break with [[Ancient philosophy|ancient thought]] was happening around the same time that [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|tower of Pisa]], showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of that particular experiment is disputed, but he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an [[inclined plane]]. His theory of accelerated motion was derived from the results of such experiments and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics.
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|240px|alt=portrait of Isaac Newton with long hair looking left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727), an influential figure in the history of physics and whose [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] form the basis of classical mechanics]]
Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]: the [[law of inertia]], his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of [[action and reaction]]; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]].'' Here they are distinguished from earlier attempts at explaining similar phenomena, which were either incomplete, incorrect, or given little accurate mathematical expression. Newton also enunciated the principles of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]. In mechanics, Newton was also the first to provide the first correct&lt;!--is this redundant?--&gt; scientific and mathematical formulation of [[gravity]] in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The combination of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics. He demonstrated that these laws apply to everyday objects as well as to celestial objects. In particular, he obtained a theoretical explanation of [[Kepler's laws]] of motion of the planets.

Newton had previously invented the [[calculus]], of mathematics, and used it to perform the mathematical calculations. For acceptability, his book, the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric methods, which were soon eclipsed by his calculus. However, it was [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] who developed the notation of the [[derivative]] and [[integral]] preferred&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, Douglas M. (1998).

[[File:WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg|left|thumb|180px|alt=photograph of William Rowan Hamilton in looking left|[[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s greatest contribution is perhaps the reformulation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].]]
Newton, and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena, including [[light]], in the form of [[geometric optics]]. Even when discovering the so-called [[Newton's rings]] (a [[wave interference]] phenomenon) he maintained his own [[corpuscular theory of light]].

After Newton, classical mechanics became a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics. Several re-formulations progressively allowed finding solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first notable re-formulation was in 1788 by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Lagrangian mechanics was in turn re-formulated in 1833 by [[William Rowan Hamilton]].

Some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to compatibility with [[electromagnetic theory]], and the famous [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]. The resolution of these problems led to the [[special theory of relativity]], often still considered a part of classical mechanics.

A second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics. When combined with [[thermodynamics]], classical mechanics leads to the [[Gibbs paradox]] of classical [[statistical mechanics]], in which [[entropy]] is not a well-defined quantity. [[Planck's law|Black-body radiation]] was not explained without the introduction of [[quantum|quanta]]. As experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain, even approximately, such basic things as the [[energy levels]] and sizes of [[atoms]] and the [[photo-electric effect]]. The effort at resolving these problems led to the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

Since the end of the 20th century, classical mechanics in [[physics]] has no longer been an independent theory. Instead, classical mechanics is now considered an approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics. Emphasis has shifted to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the [[Standard model]] and its more modern extensions into a unified [[theory of everything]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 2-10 of the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' says "For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view." The past tense here implies that classical physics is no longer fundamental.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum mechanical, low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields. Also, it has been extended into the [[complex domain]] where complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviors very similar to quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0131 Complex Elliptic Pendulum], Carl M. Bender, Daniel W. Hook, Karta Kooner in [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-88-7642-379-6_1 Asymptotics in Dynamics, Geometry and PDEs; Generalized Borel Summation vol. I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Messy paragraph.--&gt;

==Branches==
Classical mechanics was traditionally divided into three main branches:
*[[Statics]], the study of [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and its relation to [[force]]s
*[[Analytical dynamics|Dynamics]], the study of motion and its relation to forces
*[[Kinematics]], dealing with the implications of observed motions without regard for circumstances causing them

Another division is based on the choice of mathematical formalism:
*[[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian mechanics]]
*[[Lagrangian mechanics]]
*[[Hamiltonian mechanics]]

Alternatively, a division can be made by region of application:
*[[Celestial mechanics]], relating to [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and other celestial bodies
*[[Continuum mechanics]], for materials modelled as a continuum, e.g., [[solid]]s and [[fluid]]s (i.e., [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es).
*[[Relativistic mechanics]] (i.e. including the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity|general]] theories of relativity), for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light.
*[[Statistical mechanics]], which provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of materials.

'''Collaborative Diffusion''' is a type of [[pathfinding]] algorithm which uses the concept of ''antiobjects'', objects within a computer program that function opposite to what would be conventionally expected. Collaborative Diffusion is typically used in video games, when multiple agents must path towards a single target agent. For example, the ghosts in [[Pac-Man]]. In this case, the background tiles serve as antiobjects, carrying out the necessary calculations for creating a path and having the foreground objects react accordingly, whereas having foreground objects be responsible for their own pathing would be conventionally expected.

Collaborative Diffusion is favored for its efficiency over other pathfinding algorithms, such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]], when handling multiple agents. Also, this method allows elements of competition and teamwork to easily be incorporated between tracking agents. Notably, the time taken to calculate paths remains constant as the number of agents increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Repenning|first1=Alexander|title=Collaborative Diffusion: Programming Antiobjects|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf|publisher=AgentSheets Inc &amp; University of Colorado|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

A '''control flow diagram''' ('''CFD''') is a [[diagram]] to describe the [[control flow]] of a [[business process]], [[process (engineering)|process]] or review

Control flow diagrams were developed in the 1950s, and are widely used in multiple [[engineering]] disciplines. They are one of the classic [[business process modeling]] methodologies, along with [[flow chart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[data flow diagram]]s, [[functional flow block diagram]], [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT]] diagrams, and [[IDEF]].&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt; Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=2006-12-20 }}. INFS 770 Methods for Information Systems Engineering:  Knowledge Management and E-Business. Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A control flow diagram can consist of a subdivision to show sequential steps, with if-then-else conditions, repetition, and/or case conditions. Suitably annotated geometrical figures are used to represent operations, data, or equipment, and arrows are used to indicate the sequential flow from one to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ora/Inspect_ref/igs/gloss.html FDA glossary of terminology applicable to software development and computerized systems]. Accessed 14 Jan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of control flow diagrams, for example:
* Change control flow diagram, used in [[project management]]
* Configuration decision control flow diagram, used in [[configuration management]]
* [[Process control]] flow diagram, used in [[process management]]  
* Quality control flow diagram, used in [[quality control]].

In software and systems development control flow diagrams can be used in [[control flow analysis]], [[data flow analysis]], [[algorithm analysis]], and [[simulation]]. Control and data are most applicable for real time and data driven systems. These flow analyses transform logic and data requirements text into graphic flows which are easier to analyze than the text. PERT, state transition, and transaction diagrams are examples of control flow diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Dolores R. Wallace et al. (1996). [http://hissa.nist.gov/HHRFdata/Artifacts/ITLdoc/234/val-proc.html ''Reference Information for the Software Verification and Validation Process''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011193257/http://hissa.nist.gov/HHRFdata/Artifacts/ITLdoc/234/val-proc.html |date=2008-10-11 }}, NIST Special Publication 500-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Control Flow Diagrams ==
=== Process Control Flow Diagram ===
A flow diagram can be developed for the process [[control system]] for each critical activity. Process control is normally a closed cycle in which a sensor . The application determines if the sensor information is within the predetermined (or calculated) data parameters and constraints. The results of this comparison, which controls the critical component. This [[feedback]] may control the component electronically or may indicate the need for a manual action.
This closed-cycle process has many checks and balances to ensure that it stays safe. 
 It may be fully computer controlled and automated, or it may be a hybrid in which only the sensor is automated and the action requires manual intervention. 
Further, some process control systems may use prior generations of hardware and software, while others are state of the art

=== Performance seeking control flow diagram ===
The figure presents an example of a performance seeking control [[flow diagram]] of the algorithm. The control law consists of estimation, modeling, and optimization processes. In the [[Kalman filter]] estimator, the inputs, outputs, and residuals were recorded. At the compact propulsion system modeling stage, all the estimated inlet and engine parameters were recorded.&lt;ref name="GO92"/&gt;  

In addition to temperatures, pressures, and control positions, such estimated parameters as stall margins, thrust, and drag components were recorded. In the optimization phase, the operating condition constraints, optimal solution, and linear programming health status condition codes were recorded. Finally, the actual commands that were sent to the engine through the DEEC were recorded.&lt;ref name="GO92"/&gt;

A '''dead hedge''' is a barrier constructed from cut branches, [[sapling]]s, and [[foliage]]. The material can be from pruning, clearing, or forestry activities. Their succession is a [[beetle bank]] or [[hedge]]. 

==Restoration ecology and biological pest control== 
Dead hedges or wind-rows, as they are known in the coppice trade, are useful keeping the compartments of the coppice tidy, keeping the public from certain areas, being an excellent habitat and corridor for wildlife [[habitat conservation]] and [[restoration ecology]], as they offer shelter for small animals, especially birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/65 |title=Hedging |work=BTCV handbook |author=[[BTCV]] |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be part of a beneficial "biological pest agents" [[habitat]] in [[biological pest control]] programs for [[natural landscape]]s and [[organic gardening]].

==Agriculture==
Dead hedges usually provide an enclosure for the storage of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-20 |work=Northwich Community Woodlands |title=Hedge-laying - alive and well in the Northwich Community Woodlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110021455/http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above biological pest control dead hedges use is also part of [[organic farming]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

Dead hedges also recycle-reuse [[biomass]] without energy use to transport to landfills, or by burning, reducing a [[carbon footprint]] impact.

[[File:Jury international01.jpg|thumb{{largethumb}}|The same group will offer a majority vote for, as well as against, a plan depending on how the group is polled.]]

'''Discursive dilemma''' or '''doctrinal paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in [[social choice theory]]. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with [[majority voting]] can result in self-contradictory judgments.

Consider a community voting on a road repairs. The same group may return a "Yes" if asked three questions, but a "No" if asked one question. This paradox emerges because the community may vote 'Yes' - the roads are important, and 'Yes' - the weather is right for road repair, and 'Yes' - there are available funds for the repairs. However, due to complexity of individual opinion and disagreement, the majority may at the same time rule that "No, all three requirements for road repair are not present". Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.

Philosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective.

==Overview==
Princeton philosopher Philip Pettit says there are hidden challenges of describing the group as though it were a single individual - a metaphorical agent - the way the law sometimes talks about corporations. It is a mistake, he says, to think things can be that simple.

In reality, it can be quite difficult to construct a model of the "group mind" by merely asking for a majority opinion. This is because contradictory conceptions of a group can emerge depending on the type of questioning that is chosen.&lt;ref name=Pettit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2010/12/philip-pettit-on-group-agency.html|title=Philip Pettit on Group Agency|publisher=philosophybites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see how, imagine that a three-member court must decide whether someone is liable for a breach of contract. For example, a lawn caretaker is accused of violating a contract not to mow over the land-owner's roses. The judges have to decide which of the following propositions are true:
* ''P'': the defendant did a certain action (i.e. did the caretaker mow over the roses?);
* ''Q'': the defendant had a contractual obligation not to do that action (i.e. was there a contract not to mow over the roses?);
* ''C'': the defendant is liable.
Additionally, all judges accept the proposition &lt;math&gt;C \equiv P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the judges agree that a defendant should be liable if and only if the two propositions, P and Q, are both true.

Each judge could make consistent (non-contradictory) judgments, and the paradox will still emerge. Most judges could think P is true, and most judges could think Q is true. In this example, that means they would vote that the caretaker probably mowed over the roses, and that the contract did indeed forbid that action. This suggests the caretaker is ''liable''. 

At the same time, most judges may think that P and Q are not both true at once. In this example, that means most judges conclude the caretaker is ''not liable''. The table above illustrates how majority decisions can contradict (because the judges vote in favor of the premises, and yet reject the conclusion). The paradox lies in choosing between two group liability opinions.

==Explanation==
This dilemma results because an actual decision-making procedure might be premise-based or conclusion-based. In a premise-based procedure, the judges decide by voting whether the conditions for liability are met. In a conclusion-based procedure, the judges decide directly whether the defendant should be liable. In the above formulation, the paradox is that the two procedures don't necessarily lead to the same result; the two procedures can even lead to opposite results.

Pettit believes that the lesson of this paradox is that there is no simple way to aggregate individual opinions into a single, coherent "group entity". These ideas are relevant to [[sociology]], which endeavors to understand and predict group behaviour. Petitt warns that we need to understand groups because they can be very powerful, can effect greater change, and yet the group as a whole may not have a strong conscience (see [[Diffusion of responsibility]]). He says we sometimes fail to hold groups (e.g. corporations) responsible because of the difficulties described above. [[Collective responsibility]] is important to sort out, and Petitt insists that groups should have limited rights, and various obligations and checks on their power.&lt;ref name=Pettit/&gt;

The discursive dilemma (which concerns general proposition sets) can be seen as a generalization of the [[Condorcet paradox]] (which concerns preference sets, a kind of proposition set). Furthermore, the Condorcet paradox can be generalized to [[Arrow's theorem]]. List and Pettit argue that the discursive dilemma can be likewise generalized to a sort of "List-Pettit theorem". Their theorem states that the inconsistencies remain for any aggregation method which meets a few natural conditions.

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US. Based on the design of the [[Electrobat|Electrobat II]], a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edisontechcenter.org/ElectricCars.html |title=History of Electric Cars |first=Galen |last=Handy |publisher=The Edison Tech Center |location=US |year=2014 |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, [[S.R. Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco.

[[California]] electric automaker [[Tesla Motors]] began development in 2004 on what would become the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], which was first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway legal [[serial production]] all-electric car to use [[lithium-ion battery]] cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=in|round=5|order=flip}} per charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/26/electric-car-history/ | title=Electric Car Evolution |first=Zachary |last= Shahan |publisher=Clean Technica |date = 2015-04-26| accessdate=2016-09-08}} ''2008: The Tesla Roadster becomes the first production electric vehicle to use lithium-ion battery cells as well as the first production electric vehicle to have a range of over 200 miles on a single charge.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]]. Having motors connected directly to each wheel allows the wheels to be used both for propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing [[traction (engineering)|traction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Wes Siler: Comment Email Facebook Twitter |url=http://jalopnik.com/5515071/raceabout-finlands-first-electric-sports-car |title=Helsinki Metropolia University's RaceAbout |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Mike Spinelli: Comment |url=http://jalopnik.com/307457/nissan-pivo-2-360-degrees-no-reverse |title=Nissan Pivo 2 |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/plug-in-hybrid-retrofit-kit-ice-vehicle/11631/ |title=Charles Perry's Plug-In Hybrid Retrofit Kit |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not fitted with an [[axle]], [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], or [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], electric vehicles have less drive-train inertia.

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Production and [[Electric vehicle conversion|conversion]] electric cars typically use 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.17 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref name=ev1datasheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/avta/pdfs/fsev/eva_results/ev1_eva.pdf |format=PDF|year=1999|publisher=United States Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |title=Performance Statistics – 1999 General Motors EV1 w/NiMH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |date=2006-05-30 |title=Full Size Electric Vehicles |chapter=Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity |url=http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041015210239/http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |archivedate=2004-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20% of this power consumption is due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:V10084P006.jpg|thumb|Side impact test of a [[Tesla Model X]]]]

The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

* On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
* Functional safety means and protection against failures
* Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through a wall and into a tree. The fire broke out several minutes after the driver exited the vehicle.

In the United States, General Motors ran in several cities a training program for [[firefighter]]s and [[certified first responder|first responders]] to demonstrate how to safely disable the [[Chevrolet Volt]]’s powertrain and its 12 volt electrical system.

===Vehicle safety===

===Hazard to pedestrians===
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

The range of production electric vehicles in 2017 ranged from {{convert|100|km|mi}} ([[Renault Twizy]]) to {{convert|540|km|mi}} ([[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S 100D]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/22/tesla-long-range-electric-car/|title=Tesla Quietly Introduces Longest-Range Electric Car on the Market|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of electric cars are fitted with a display of expected range. This may take into account many factors of how the vehicle is being used, and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual achieved range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some [[roadside assistance]] organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served "thousands" of EVs without power|work=Electrek|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2016 stated that 87% of US vehicle-days can be met by current affordable electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/16/electric-cars-good-enough-for-90-percent-of-trips.html |title=Electric cars good enough for 90 percent of trips |first=Robert |last=Ferris |work=CNBC |date=2016-08-17 |access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016112 |title=Potential for widespread electrification of personal vehicle travel in the United States : Nature Energy |first1=Zachary A. |last1=Needell |first2=James |last2=McNerney |first3=Michael T. |last3=Chang |first4=Jessika E. |last4=Trancik |website=Nature |date=2015-12-31  |doi=10.1038/nenergy.2016.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charging===
{{main|Charging station}}
Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

====Hybrid vehicles====
{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade? Unwahrscheinlich!“]; retrieved, 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction ===
Over half of the world's cobalt, a key element in lithium-ion batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the children are forced to mine the cobalt while having little to no protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/child-labor-still-rife-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-39194724|title=Child labor still rife in Democratic Republic of Congo|last=Cascais|first=Antonio|date=November 6, 2017|website=DW.COM|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other methods of energy storage
Experimental [[electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices offer comparable storage capacity, faster charging, and lower volatility.

==Infrastructure==

===Charging station===

[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]]]]
{{Main|charging station}}

[[Battery electric vehicle|Battery Electric Vehicles]] are most commonly charged from the [[power grid]] overnight at the owner's house, provided they have their own charging station. The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

Charging stations can have a variety of different speeds of charging, with slower charging being more common for houses, and more powerful charging stations on public roads and areas for trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Developing Infrastructure to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles|website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW i3]] can charge 0–80% of the battery in under 30 minutes in rapid charging mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charging time for the BMW i3 |url=http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |publisher=BMW |location=UK |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921015553/http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superchargers developed by Tesla Motors provided up to 130&amp;nbsp;kW of charging, allowing a 300-mile charge in about an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/|title=How Quickly does the tesla model S battery charge?|last=Popely|first=Rick|date=November 9, 2013|website=Cars.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connectors====
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union, as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name="acea2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles |publisher=ACEA Brussels |date=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132407/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], an '''exclusive right''', or '''exclusivity''', is a de facto, non-tangible [[prerogative]] existing in law (that is, the [[power (sociology)|power]] or, in a wider sense, [[right]]) to perform an action or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform the same action or to acquire the same benefit. A "prerogative" is in effect an exclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign (i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of [[monopoly]].

Exclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the exclusivity.

Exclusive rights may be granted in [[property law]], [[copyright law]], [[patent law]],  in relation to [[public utility|public utilities]], or, in some jurisdictions, in other ''[[sui generis]]'' legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for the concepts of [[property (ownership right)|property]] and [[ownership]].

Privately granted rights, created by [[contract]], may occasionally appear very similar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and not the world at large.

==Types of exclusive rights==

===Property===

In relation to [[property]], an exclusive right will, for the most part, arise when something tangible is acquired; as a result, others are prevented from exercising control of that thing. For example, a person may prohibit others from entering and using their [[real property|land]], or from taking their [[personal property|personal possessions]]. However, an exclusive right is not necessarily absolute, as an [[easement]] may allow a certain level of public access to [[private land]].

===Intellectual property===

Most [[government]]s recognize a [[Bundle of Rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] in relation to works of authorship, inventions, and identifications of origin. These rights are sometimes spoken of under the [[umbrella term]] "[[intellectual property]]."

==History and arguments==

In Anglo-Saxon property law, exclusive rights have often been the codification of pre-existing [[Norm (sociology)|social norm]]s with regard to land or [[Personal property|chattel]]s.

In [[continental Europe]] there is a view that copyrights, patents, and the like are the codification of some kind of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]], [[natural right]], or [[personamility rights|personalitlly right]]. However, such arguments can only be consistently justified through [[instrumentalism]] or [[consequentialism]], as exemplified by the reasoning inferred in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] that copyrights and patents exist solely "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."

==Methodology==
The ratings process involves several dozen analysts (Freedom House staff and consultants) who develop draft ratings using information gathered from professional contacts in a variety of countries, staff and consultant travel, international visitors, the findings of human rights and press freedom organizations, specialists in geographic and geopolitical areas, the reports of governments and multilateral bodies, members of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] (IFEX) network, and a variety of domestic and international news media. Countries are given a total score from 0 (most free) to 100 (least free) on the basis of a set of 23 methodology questions and 109 indicators divided into three broad categories covering the legal, political, and economic environment. Based on the scores, the countries are then classified as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100). The draft ratings are reviewed on an individual and a comparative basis, compared with the previous year's findings, any major proposed numerical shifts or category changes are subject to more intense scrutiny, and assessments are made to ensure comparability and consistency in the findings from country to country, region to region, and year to year. While there is an element of subjectivity inherent in the rating process, it emphasizes intellectual rigor, recognizes cultural differences, diverse national interests, and varying levels of economic development, and attempts to produce balanced and unbiased ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTP%20Methodology%202012.pdf "Methodology"], ''Freedom of the Press 2012'', Freedom House, 21 June 2012, retrieved 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Gender schema theory''' was formally introduced by [[Sandra Bem]] in 1981 as a cognitive theory to explain how individuals become gendered in society, and how sex-linked characteristics are maintained and transmitted to other members of a culture.&lt;ref name="bemsl"&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981). Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review, 88'', 354–364&lt;/ref&gt;
Gender-associated information is predominantly transmuted through society by way of [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]], or networks of information that allow for some information to be more easily assimilated than others. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] argues that there are individual differences in the degree to which people hold these gender schemata. These differences are manifested via the degree to which individuals are sex-typed.

==Sex-typing==
Core gender identity is tied up in the sex typing that an individual undergoes. This typing can be heavily influenced by child rearing, media, school, and other forms of cultural transmission. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] refers to four categories in which an individual may fall: sex-typed, cross-sex-typed, androgynous, and undifferentiated. Sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with their gender. Cross-sex-typed individuals process and integrate information that is in line with the opposite gender. Androgynous individuals process and integrate traits and information from both genders. Finally, undifferentiated individuals do not show efficient processing of sex-typed information.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Gender stereotypes==
{{see also|Sexism#Gender stereotypes|Gender role#Gender stereotypes|Implicit stereotype#Gender stereotype}}
Being that gender schema theory is a theory of process and not content, this theory can help explain some of the processes by which gender stereotypes become so psychologically ingrained in our society. Specifically, having strong gender schemata provides a filter through which we process incoming stimuli in the environment. This leads to an easier ability to assimilate information that is stereotype congruent, hence further solidifying the existence of gender stereotypes.  Within adolescent development, Bem hypothesizes that children must choose among a plethora of dimensions, but that gender schemas lead to the regulation of behaviors that conform to the cultural definition of what it means to be male or female.  Additionally, Bem asserts that there is also a [[heterosexuality]] subschema, which likely encouraged the development of gender schemas.  Most societies treat exclusive heterosexuality as the benchmark for proper masculinity and femininity—that is, heterosexuality is the norm.  Furthermore, the heterosexuality subschema asserts that men and women are supposed to be different from one another. It is hypothesized that this is why cross-sexed interactions are likely to be sexually coded.  Sex-typed individuals have a general readiness to invoke the heterosexuality subschema in social interactions, behaving differently towards individuals of the opposite sex that they find attractive v. unattractive.

==Evidence==
Some of the early tests of gender schema theory came in the form of memory and other cognitive tasks designed to assess facilitated processing of sex-typed information. Much of this early research found that participants who were sex-typed remembered more traits associated with their sex, as well as processed sex-type congruent information more efficiently, suggesting that the gender schemata possessed by sex-typed individuals help to assimilate sex-associated information into one’s self-concept (see Bem, 1981).&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;
[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] showed that when given the option of clustering words by either semantic meaning or gender, sex-typed individuals are more likely to use the gender clustering system, followed by undifferentiated individuals.  Cross-typed individuals had the lowest percentage of words clustered by gender.&lt;ref name="bemsl" /&gt;

==Positive social change==
A strong source of sex-typing comes from the rearing practices of parents. [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] offers strong suggestions for preventing the sex-typing of children, including the prevention of access to media that promotes sex-typing, altering media and stories to eliminate sex-typing information, and modeling equal roles for mothers and fathers in the household.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1983). Gender schema theory and its implications for child development: Raising gender-aschematic children in a gender-schematic society. ''Signs, 8,'' 598–616.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Bem edited the books that her children read to create a more androgynous view.  This included, for example, drawing long hair and feminine body characteristics on male figures.  Ultimately, however, this is somewhat limited because children will become exposed to some of this sex-typing information, particularly when they begin attending school. Therefore, [[Sandra Bem|Bem]] suggests teaching alternative schemata to children so that they are less likely to build and maintain a gender schema. Some examples include an individual differences schema, where children learn to process information on a person-by-person basis rather than make wide assumptions about groups based on information from individuals. Also, providing children with a sexism schema, where children learn to process sex-typed information through a filter that promotes moral outrage when sexist information is being promoted, can assist in providing children with the resources to not only keep from becoming sex-typed but also promote positive social change.

Bem wished to raise consciousness that the male/female dichotomy is used as an organizing framework, often unnecessarily, especially in the school curriculum. She stressed that the omnirelevance of gender has a negative impact on society, and that the gender schema should be more limited in scope.  Within the feminist lens, androgyny is not radical enough, because androgyny means that “masculine” and “feminine” still exist.  Rather, society should decrease the use of the gender dichotomy as a functional unit, and be aschematic.

==Legacy==
The legacy of gender schema theory has not been one of obvious lasting impact in the psychology of gender. [[Sandra Bem|Bem's]] theory was undoubtedly informed by the cognitive revolution of the 1970s and 1980s and was coming at a time when the psychology of gender was drastically picking up interest as more and more women were entering academic fields. While gender schema theory does provide a cognitive backbone for how gender stereotypes may continue to be maintained in current society, it lost wind as more broad sociological theories became the dominant force in the psychology of gender. A major limitation of gender schema theory has been that once research supported the nature of the process, there was little work that followed.

The longest-lasting contribution to the field has been the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]]. Originally developed as a tool to identify sex-typed individuals, many researchers use the measure to look at other components of gender, including endorsement of gender stereotypes and as a measure of masculinity/femininity. Caution should be employed when examining research that uses the Bem Sex-Role Inventory for measuring constructs that it was not created to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, R. M., &amp; Borders, L. D. A. (2001). Twenty-five years after the Bem Sex-Role Inventory: A reassessment and new issues regarding classification variability. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, 34,'' 39–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Bem|Bem]] herself admitted that she was ill-prepared to develop the Bem Sex-Role Inventory and never anticipated it being as widely used as it still is today.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (2001). ''An unconventional family.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5610">'''Geospatial topology''' studies the rules concerning the relationships between the points, lines, and polygons that represent the features of a geographic region. For example, where two polygons represent adjacent counties, typical [[topology|topological]] rules would require that the counties share a common boundary with no gaps and no overlaps. Similarly, it would be nonsense to allow two polygons representing lakes to overlap.

In ''spatial analysis'' the topological [[spatial relations]] are derived from the [[DE-9IM]] model, as spatial predicates about relations between points, lines, and/or areas: Equals, Contains, Covers, CoveredBy, Crosses, Disjoint, Intersects, Overlaps, Touches and Within. In network and [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] representations the [http://www.postgis.org/docs/Topology.html topology analysis] is about topological objects such as faces, edges and nodes.

The [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] White Paper ''[[GIS]] Topology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = GIS Topology| work = | publisher = ESRI| year = 2005| url = http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/gis_topology.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that topology operations are used to manage shared geometry, define and enforce [[data integrity]] rules, support topological relationship queries and navigation, and build more complex shapes such as polygons, from primitive ones such as lines. A ''GIS for Educators'' worksheet at Linfiniti&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Understanding topology in vector data| work = | publisher = Department of Land Affairs, Eastern Cape, South Africa| year = 2009| url = http://linfiniti.com/dla/worksheets/6_Topology.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; adds the detection and correction of [[digitising]] errors and carrying out [[Network theory|network analysis]]. Topological error correction is explained in more detail in a paper by Ubeda and Egenhofer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ubeda |first1=Thierry |last2=Egenhofer |first2=Max J. |title=Advances in Spatial Databases |chapter=Topological error correcting in GIS |pages=281–297 |year=1997 |doi=10.1007/3-540-63238-7_35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Geography Markup Language|GML]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Quak| first = Wilko | authorlink = |author2=de Vries, Marian| title = Topological and temporal modelling in GML| work = | publisher = Delft University of Technology| year = 2005| url = http://www.gdmc.nl/publications/2005/Topological_Temporal_Modelling_GML.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; topologies are not directly represented in [[ESRI shapefile]]s which store individual geometric objects in isolation. Topological processing can, however, be undertaken in GIS software such as [[GRASS GIS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = GRASS Development Team| first = | authorlink = | title = GRASS GIS 7 manual| work = | publisher = | year = 2014| url = http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/vectorintro.html| doi = | accessdate = 2014-05-19}} ''"Vector data processing in GRASS GIS"''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[QGIS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = QGIS Development Team| first = | authorlink = | title = QGIS User Guide| work = | publisher = | year = 2011| url = http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/doc/manual/qgis-1.7.0_user_guide_en.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-25}}
 section 9.5: ''"A boundary between two adjacent areas is digitized only once, and it is shared by both areas"''&lt;/ref&gt; or could in principle be enforced using integrity constraints in a GIS-enabled [[DBMS]] such as [[PostGIS]]. However, as Riedemann (2004) explains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Riedemann |first=Catharina |title=Towards Usable Topological Operators at GIS User Interfaces |editors=Toppen, F. and P. Prastacos 7th |conference=7th AGILE Conference on Geographic Information Science |location=Heraklion, Greece |pages=669–674 |year=2004 |url=https://agile-online.org/conference_paper/cds/agile_2004/papers/8-1-3_riedemann.pdf |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; topological operators are inherently complex and their implementation requires care to be taken with usability and conformance to standards.

[[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and PostGIS provide fundamental topological operators allowing applications to test for ''"such relationships as contains, inside, covers, covered by, touch, and overlap with boundaries intersecting."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Oracle| first = | authorlink = | title = Topology Data Model Overview| work = Oracle 10g Part No. B10828-01| publisher = Oracle| year = 2003| url = http://docs.oracle.com/html/B10828_01/sdo_topo_concepts.htm#BABDHJAF| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Geometry Relationship Functions| work = | publisher = Refractions Research Inc| url = http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-1.3/ch06.html#id2574517| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the PostGIS documentation, the Oracle documentation draws a distinction between ''"topological relationships [which] remain constant when the coordinate space is deformed, such as by twisting or stretching"'' and ''"relationships that are not topological [which] include length of, distance between, and area of."'' These operators are leveraged by applications to ensure that data sets are stored and processed in a topologically correct fashion.

 | footer = The gender of God in Hinduism is sometimes visualized as a male god such as [[Krishna]] (left), or female goddess such as [[Lakshmi]] (middle), androgynous such as [[Ardhanarishvara]] (a composite of [[Shiva|Siva or Shiva]] - male - and [[Parvati]] - female) (right), or as formless and genderless [[Brahman]] (Universal Absolute, Supreme Self as Oneness in everyone).

 }}
In [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing [[Gender of God|God and gender]]. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.&lt;ref&gt;John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hinduism}}
Male and female deities are extensively mentioned in the Vedas. The earliest ''mandalas'' ("Books"; the authorship of each ''mandala'' is traditionally ascribed to a particular ''[[rishi]]'' or that ''rishi'''s family) of the [[Rigveda]], estimated to have been composed sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE, invoke and praise both gods and goddesses. ''[[Ushas]]'' ("Goddess of Dawns") is praised in twenty Hymns of Chapters VI.64, VI.65, VII.78 and X.172, with Hymn VI.64.5 declaring goddess Ushas as the one who must be worshipped first.&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitac00websgoog#page/n19/mode/2up Rigveda] Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co London, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
'''Hymn to Ushas''' (Abridged):&lt;br&gt;
The shining tints of the Dawn have spread like the waves of the waters,&lt;br&gt;
Beautifying the world, she renders all good roads easy to traverse,&lt;br&gt;
She who is replete with delight, excellence and health,&lt;br&gt;
Divine Ushas, though art seen auspicious, thou shinest afar,&lt;br&gt;
thy bright rays spread over the sky, lovely and radiant with great splendour;&lt;br&gt;
Do thou Ushas bring me opulence, daughter of heaven;&lt;br&gt;
thou who art divine, who art lovely, who art to be worshipped at the first daily rite;&lt;br&gt;
At thy dawning, divine Ushas, birds fly from their resting places, men arise to work;&lt;br&gt;
Thou, divine Ushas, bring ample wealth to the mortal, the offerer of these prayers.
|Rigveda|VI.64&lt;ref&gt;
*Original Sanskrit: '''एषा''' स्या नो दुहिता दिवोजाः क्षितीरुच्छन्ती मानुषीरजीगः । या भानुना रुशता राम्यास्वज्ञायि तिरस्तमसश्चिदक्तून् ॥१॥ वि तद्ययुररुणयुग्भिरश्वैश्चित्रं '''भान्त्युषसश्चन्द्ररथाः''' । अग्रं यज्ञस्य बृहतो नयन्तीर्वि ता बाधन्ते तम ऊर्म्यायाः ॥२॥ (...) इदा हि त '''उषो''' अद्रिसानो गोत्रा गवामङ्गिरसो गृणन्ति । व्यर्केण बिभिदुर्ब्रह्मणा च सत्या नृणामभवद्देवहूतिः ॥५॥ '''उच्छा''' दिवो दुहितः प्रत्नवन्नो भरद्वाजवद्विधते मघोनि । सुवीरं रयिं गृणते रिरीह्युरुगायमधि धेहि श्रवो नः ॥६॥ (Source: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_६.६५ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ६.६५] Wikisource)

Goddesses, other than Ushas, mentioned in early Vedic literature include ''Prthivi'' (earth), ''Aditi'' (mother of gods, abundance), ''Sarasvati'' (river, nourishment), ''Vac'' (sound and speech), and ''Nirrti'' (death, destruction).&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt; Similarly male gods feature prominently in the Vedas, with ''Indra'' (rain, lightning), ''Agni'' (fire), ''Varuna'' (rta, law), ''Dyaus'' (sky, virility), ''Savitr'' (''Surya'', sun), and ''Soma'' (drink) some of the most mentioned. The two deities most mentioned in Rigveda are [[Indra]] and [[Agni]], both male.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}, pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; Surya is the third most revered god, again a male.&lt;ref name=wjw&gt;William Joseph Wilkins, {{Google books|ZBUHAAAAQAAJ|Hindu Mythology: Vedic and Purānic|page=8}}, London Missionary Society, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Each is mentioned, anywhere rain and fire is evoked. They are profusely praised, with ceremonies and prayers to all gods and goddesses symbolically organized around fire (Agni [[yajna]]). The hymns seek strengthening of fire, and it is god Indra who increases the energy of the fire, while god Surya increases his brightness.  [[Max Muller]] states that, while there are difference in frequency of mentions, gods and goddesses in Rig veda are "neither superior nor inferior; almost every one is represented as supreme and absolute".&lt;ref name=wjw/&gt;

Gross states that ancient and medieval Hindu literature is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God.&lt;ref name=rmg&gt;RM Gross (1978), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1463798 Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Sep., 1978), pages 269-291&lt;/ref&gt; This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with "He" and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross,&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.&lt;ref name=davidk&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

God is not either male or female concept in ancient Indian literature. Androgynous concepts of god are common place as well.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

===Brahman===
Most major schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] focus their philosophical discourse on the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Universal Absolute]], called [[Brahman]], which is a grammatically genderless noun.&lt;ref name=hrz&gt;Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1972), Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691017785}}, pages 123-128&lt;/ref&gt; This Universal Absolute, states Zimmer, is "beyond the differentiating qualifications of sex, beyond any and all limitations, individualizing characteristics whatsoever". The ''Brahman'' is the Great Cosmic Spirit, the Ultimate True Reality, the Supreme Self. It is a transcendental concept that includes all virtues, forms, genders, characteristics, capacities, knowledge and being-ness.&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt; The history of the genderless concept of Brahman, as the omnipresent Absolute Spirit and Supreme Self, can be traced back to Vedas, and extensively in the earliest Upanishads, such as hymns 1.4.10 and 4.4.5 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 1.4.10: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n171/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 1.4.10] pages 145-146;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 4.4.5: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n739/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 4.4.5] pages 712-713;&lt;/ref&gt; and hymn 6.2.1 of Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानिति शान्त उपासीत । अथ खलु क्रतुमयः पुरुषो यथाक्रतुरस्मिँल्लोके पुरुषो भवति तथेतः प्रेत्य भवति स क्रतुं कुर्वीत ॥ १ ॥ ([http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_२ छान्दोग्योपनिषद्] Wikisource);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 1: All this indeed is '''Brahman'''. From It the universe comes forth, in It the universe merges, and in It the universe breathes. Therefore a man should meditate on Brahman with a calm mind. Now, a man consists of free will. As he wills in this world, so does he become. Let him, with this knowledge in mind, form his free will. ([http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chandogya Upanishad The Sandilya Doctrine - 3.14.1]);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: [https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n165/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad III.xiv.1] GN Jha (Translator), page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer clarifies the notion of gender in Sanskrit language and its relation to the concepts of Brahman and God in Hinduism, as follows:

{{Quote|
It must be understood that in Sanskrit, grammatical gender is not always a sign of physical sex. Gender infers function, sex infers form; so that an individual&lt;ref&gt;man or woman&lt;/ref&gt; may be masculine from one point of view and feminine from another. (...) Brahman can be regarded as the "womb" of life, and as in Christianity "this man" and "this woman" are equally "feminine to God" [in Hinduism]. Absolutely, Brahman, although grammatically neuter, is the principle of all such differentiation. Essence and nature are respectively masculine and feminine, logically distinct, but "one in God," who is neither this nor that [in Hinduism], and therefore "It" rather than "He" or "She" specifically.
|[[Heinrich Zimmer]]|Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt;}}

==Mythology==
Hindu mythology incorporates numerous devas (gods) and devis (goddesses). These are symbolic stories that synthesize God and gender, with ideas and values. The [[Vishnu Purana]], for example, recites one such myth describes male gods and female goddesses with names that is loaded with symbolism. An excerpt of the story is as follows,&lt;ref name=vp/&gt;

{{Quote|
The progeny of [[Dharma]] by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddhá (devotion) he had [[Kama]] (desire); by Lakshmí (wealth, prosperity), was born Darpa (pride); by Dhriti (courage), the progeny was [[Niyama]] (precept); by Tusht́i (inner comfort), Santosha (contentment); by Pusht́i (opulence), the progeny was Lobha (cupidity, greed); by Medhá (wisdom, experience), Sruta (sacred tradition); by Kriyá (hard work, labour), the progeny were Dańd́a, Naya, and Vinaya (justice, politics, and education); by Buddhi (intellect), Bodha (understanding); by Lajjá (shame, humility), Vinaya (good behaviour); by Vapu (body, strength), Vyavasaya (perseverance). Shanti (peace) gave birth to Kshama (forgiveness); Siddhi (excellence) to Sukha (enjoyment); and Kírtti (glorious speech) gave birth to Yasha (reputation). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama (love, emotional fulfillment) had baby Hersha (joy) by his wife Nandi (delight).

The wife of Adharma (vice, wrong, evil) was Hinsá (violence), on whom he begot a son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, Máyá (deceit) and Vedaná (torture), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya (fear) and Máyá (deceit) was the destroyer of living creatures, or Mrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka (hell) and Vedaná (torture). The children of Mrityu were Vyádhi (disease), Jará (decay), Soka (sorrow), Trishńa (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.|Vishnu Purana|Chapter 7, Translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]]&lt;ref name=vp&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp041.htm Vishnu Purana] Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

=== Smarta and Advaita ===
The [[Smarta]] tradition, which by and large, follows [[Advaita]] philosophy believes all forms, male and female, to be different forms of the impersonal Absolute, [[Brahman]] which is of neuter gender and can never be defined.
Brahman is viewed as without personal attributes ([[Nirguna Brahman]]) or with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]], equated with [[Ishvara]]) as [[God]]. In [[Advaita Vedanta]], Ishvara is Brahman. Thus according to [[Smarta]] views, the divine can be with attributes, [[Saguna Brahman]], and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a goddess) a devotee conceives.

===Siva and Vishnu===
In [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/docs/srv_faq.html#who= Dvaita Documentation: Vaishnava FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaivam.org/shpintro.htm Shaivam - An Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; God, [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] respectively, is personified as male. God, however, transcends gender in these sub-schools, and the male form is used as an icon to help focus the [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship). The use of icons is not restricted to male forms. It takes various forms and shapes. The Shaivites and Vaishnavites worship God in non-anthropomorphic, symbolic male-female images as well, such as the [[linga]]-[[yoni]] and [[Sila (murti)|Saligram]] respectively. In their literature, the principle of God's true nature as sexless is emphasized as in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Thus, the first few names,{{which|date=February 2015}} of Vishnu sahasranama, in particular, do not describe features of Vishnu in detail and hence are not [[anthropomorphic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Shakti ===
[[Shaktism]], on the other hand, is a denomination of Hinduism that worships [[Shakti]], or [[Devi]] [[Mother goddess|Mata]]—the Hindu name for the [[Mother goddess|Great Divine Mother]]—in all of her forms whilst not rejecting the importance of masculine and neuter divinity (which are however deemed to be inactive in the absence of the Shakti). In pure Shaktism, the Great Goddess, or [[Mahadevi|Devi]], is worshiped. N. N. Bhattacharyya{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} explained that "[those] who worship the Supreme Deity exclusively as a Female Principle are called [[Shakta]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Alternative interpretations of Shaktism, however—primarily those of [[Shaivite]] scholars, such as [[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]]—argue that the feminine manifest is ultimately only the vehicle through which the masculine Un-manifest [[Parasiva]] is ultimately reached.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Radha Krishna ===
{{main|Radha Krishna}}
The common separation of Sakti and Saktiman, i.e. Female and Male principle in god arrives at the conclusion Sakti and Saktiman are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta,A History of Indian Philosophy (1991) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every god has its partner, 'better-half' or Sakti and without this Sakti he is sometimes viewed being without essential power.&lt;ref&gt;Santilata Dei, Del Santilata, Vaisnavism in Orissa (1988) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In some Bhakti schools, devotees of Hinduism worship both genders as a God-pair, rather than a specific gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beck, Guy L. |title=Alternative Krishnas: regional and vernacular variations on a Hindu deity |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=2005 |isbn=0-7914-6415-6 |oclc= |doi= |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SJ73GHSCF8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Radha+is+supreme&amp;ei=PTeWSLa_BouCjwGTyY2sDQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0UsEEDGzKto2Ryf-_UW0R2kzuyRw p. 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kakoli Basak, (1991) Rabindranath Tagore, a Humanist - p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (''Shakti'') implies a divine source of energy, i.e. God as ''shaktiman''. "Sita relates to [[Rama]]; [[Lakshmi]] belongs to [[Narayana]]; [[Radha]] has Her [[Krishna]]." The female, in these pairs, is viewed as the source of energy and essence of the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Symmons (1998), This is Hinduism, Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|978-0748730933}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 260-263&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the prominent features of Vaishnavism in Manipur, for example, is the worship of the two genders together. Devotees do not worship Krishna alone, or Radha alone, but Radha-Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-wbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Manipur+Radha&amp;dq=Manipur+Radha&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature - p. 4290], Amaresh Datta, Mohan Lal,1994&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rasa (theology)|Rasa]]'' and other dances are a feature of the regional [[Folk religion|folk]] and religious tradition and often, for example, a female dancer will portray both 'male' Krishna and his consort, Radha, in the same piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwartz|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Hansei'''''|反省||"self-reflection"}} is a central idea in [[Japan]]ese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. This is similar to the German proverb ''Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt zur Besserung,'' where the closest translation to English would be "Self-awareness is the first step to improvement".

==Cultural meaning==
In the ''hansei'' process, the emphasis is on what went wrong and on creating clear plans for ensuring that it does not reoccur; this is done constantly and consistently. At [[Toyota]], even if you do a project successfully, there is still a ''hansei-kai'' (reflection meeting) to review what went wrong. If a manager or engineer claims that there were not any problems with the project, they will be reminded that “no problem is a problem” – in other words, you have not objectively and [[Critical thinking|critically]] evaluated the project to find opportunities for improvement. No problems indicate that you did not stretch to meet (or exceed) your expected capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Cultural examples==
An example would be the actions of Japanese politicians involved in corruption. They apologize publicly for the inappropriate action, then remove themselves from public politics for a few years. They resume their career after a culturally accepted period of time where they learned their lesson.

In Japanese companies it is common practice for a manager to expect ''hansei'' from his subordinates in case of mistakes. The manager will publicly take the blame, while the department works on solving the problem.

==Other use==  
Hansei also incorporates the concept of greeting success with modesty and [[humility]]. To stop ''hansei,'' means to stop learning. With ''hansei,'' one never becomes convinced of one's own [[Superiority complex|superiority]], and feels that there is always more room, or need, for further improvement.

'''Hazing in the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]]''' refers to [[hazing]] and [[bullying]] carried out within the military, often to conscripts and junior members. A similar example is that of Russia's [[Dedovshchina]]. Hazing was enforced mainly under the pretext of establishing military discipline, despite evidence that it did not achieve that goal. Hazing resulted in cases of [[fragging]] and [[suicide]], which are referred to as non-combat casualties.&lt;ref&gt;박휘락. (2014). 한국군의 악성 병영사고 예방책들의 평가와 대안. 한국의회학회보, 3(1), 155–177. Park, Hwee Rhak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36533">[[File:Heckscher-Ohlin 4.svg|thumb|300px|Basic situation: Two identical countries (A and B) have different initial factor endowments. Autarky equilibrium (&lt;math&gt;A^A, A^B&lt;/math&gt;): no trade, individual production equals consumption. Trade equilibrium: both countries consume the same (&lt;math&gt;C^A = C^B&lt;/math&gt;), especially beyond their own [[Production–possibility frontier]]; production and consumption points are divergent.]]
The '''Heckscher–Ohlin model''' ('''H–O model''') is a [[general equilibrium]] mathematical model of [[international trade]], developed by [[Eli Heckscher]] and [[Bertil Ohlin]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. It builds on [[David Ricardo|David Ricardo's]] theory of [[comparative advantage]] by predicting patterns of commerce and production based on the [[Factors of production|factor]] endowments of a trading region. The model essentially says that countries export products that use their abundant and cheap factors of production, and import products that use the countries' scarce factors.&lt;ref name="blaug"&gt;{{cite book |title= The methodology of economics, or, How economists explain |last= Blaug |first= Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1992 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 0-521-43678-8 |page= 190|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T4y7HyduGnIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA190,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the model==
Relative endowments of the [[factors of production]] ([[Land (economics)|land]], [[Labor (economics)|labor]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) determine a country's comparative advantage. Countries have comparative advantages in those [[Good (economics)|goods]] for which the required factors of production are relatively abundant locally. This is because the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of goods is determined by input costs. Goods that require inputs that are locally abundant are cheaper to produce than those goods that require inputs that are locally scarce.

For example, a country where capital and land are abundant but labor is scarce has a comparative advantage in goods that require lots of capital and land, but little labor—grains. If capital and land are abundant, their prices are low. As they are the main factors in the production of grain, the price of grain is also low—and thus attractive for both local consumption and export. [[Labor intensity|Labor-intensive]] goods on the other hand are very expensive to produce since labor is scarce and its price is high. Therefore, the country is better off importing those goods.

==Theoretical development==
The Ricardian model of [[comparative advantage]] has trade ultimately motivated by differences in labour productivity using different "technologies". Heckscher and Ohlin did not require production technology to vary between countries, so (in the interests of simplicity) the "H–O model has identical production technology everywhere". Ricardo considered a single [[factor of production]] (labour) and would not have been able to produce comparative advantage without technological differences between countries (all nations would become [[autarkic]] at various stages of growth, with no reason to trade with each other). The H–O model removed technology variations but introduced variable capital endowments, recreating [[endogenous]]ly the inter-country variation of labour productivity that Ricardo had imposed [[exogenous]]ly. With international variations in the capital endowment like [[infrastructure]] and goods requiring different factor "proportions", Ricardo's comparative advantage emerges as a profit-maximizing solution of capitalist's choices from ''within'' the model's equations. The decision that capital owners are faced with is between investments in differing production technologies; the H–O model assumes capital is privately held.

=== Original publication ===

[[Bertil Ohlin]] first explained the theory in a book published in 1933. Ohlin wrote the book alone, but he credited Heckscher as co-developer of the model because of his earlier work on the problem, and because many of the ideas in the final model came from Ohlin's doctoral thesis, supervised by Heckscher.

''Interregional and International Trade'' itself was verbose, rather than being pared down to the mathematical, and appealed because of its new insights.

=== 2×2×2 model ===

The original H–O model assumed that the only difference between countries was the relative abundances of labour and capital. The original Heckscher–Ohlin model contained two countries, and had two commodities that could be produced. Since there are two (homogeneous) factors of production this model is sometimes called the "2&amp;times;2&amp;times;2 model".

The model has "variable factor proportions" between countries—highly developed countries have a comparatively high capital-to-labor ratio compared to [[developing countries]]. This makes the developed country capital-abundant relative to the developing country, and the developing nation [[labor-abundant]] in relation to the developed country.

With this single difference, Ohlin was able to discuss the new mechanism of [[comparative advantage]], using just two goods and two technologies to produce them. One technology would be a [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]] industry, the other a labor-intensive business—see "assumptions" below.

=== Extensions ===

The model has been extended since the 1930s by many economists. These developments did not change the fundamental role of variable factor proportions in driving international trade, but added to the model various real-world considerations (such as [[tariff]]s) in the hopes of increasing the model's predictive power, or as a mathematical way of discussing [[macroeconomic]] policy options.

Notable contributions came from [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Ronald W. Jones|Ronald Jones]], and [[Jaroslav Vanek]], so that variations of the model are sometimes called the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model or the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model in the [[neo-classical economics]].

== Theoretical assumptions ==

The original, 2×2×2 model was derived with restrictive assumptions, partly for the sake of mathematical simplicity. Some of these have been relaxed for the sake of development. These assumptions and developments are listed here.

=== Both countries have identical production technology ===

This assumption means that producing the same output of either commodity ''could'' be done with the same level of capital and labour in either country. Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another way of saying this is that the per-capita [[productivity]] is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.

Countries have natural advantages in the production of various commodities in relation to one another, so this is an "unrealistic" simplification designed to highlight the effect of variable factors. This meant that the original H–O model produced an alternative explanation for free trade to Ricardo's, rather than a complementary one; in reality, both effects may occur due to differences in technology and factor abundances.

In addition to natural advantages in the production of one sort of output over another (wine vs. rice, say) the infrastructure, education, culture, and "know-how" of countries differ so dramatically that the idea of identical technologies is a theoretical notion. Ohlin said that the H–O model was a long-run model, and that the conditions of industrial production are "everywhere the same" in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/ho.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production output is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale ===
In a simple model, both countries produce two commodities. Each commodity in turn is made using two factors of production. The production of each commodity requires input from both factors of production—capital (K) and labor (L). The technologies of each commodity is assumed to exhibit constant [[returns to scale]] (CRS). CRS technologies implies that when inputs of both capital and labor is multiplied by a factor of ''k'', the output also multiplies by a factor of ''k''. For example, if both capital and labor inputs are doubled, output of the commodities is doubled. In other terms the production function of both commodities is "[[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree 1".

The assumption of constant returns to scale CRS is useful because it exhibits a diminishing returns in a factor. Under constant returns to scale, doubling both capital and labor leads to a doubling of the output. Since outputs are increasing in both factors of production, doubling capital while holding labor constant leads to less than doubling of an output. Diminishing returns to capital and diminishing returns to labor are crucial to the [[Stolper–Samuelson theorem]].

=== The technologies used to produce the two commodities differ ===

The CRS production functions must differ to make trade worthwhile in this model. For instance if the functions are [[Cobb–Douglas]] technologies the parameters applied to the inputs must vary. An example would be:

: Arable industry:  &lt;math&gt; A = {{K}^{1/3}}{{L}^{2/3}} &lt;/math&gt;
: Fishing industry:  &lt;math&gt;  F = {{K}^{1/2}} {{L}^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''A'' is the output in [[agronomy|arable]] production, ''F'' is the output in fish production, and ''K'', ''L'' are capital and labor in both cases.

In this example, the marginal return to an extra unit of capital is higher in the [[fishing industry]], assuming units of fish (''F'') and arable output (''A'') have equal value. The more capital-abundant country may gain by developing its fishing fleet at the expense of its arable farms. Conversely, the workers available in the relatively labor-abundant country can be employed relatively more efficiently in arable farming.

=== Factor mobility within countries ===
Within countries, capital and labor can be reinvested and reemployed to produce different outputs. Similar to Ricardo's [[comparative advantage]] argument, this is assumed to happen without cost. If the two production technologies are the arable industry and the fishing industry it is assumed that farmers can shift to work as fishermen with no cost and vice versa.

It is further assumed that capital can shift easily into either technology, so that the industrial mix can change without adjustment costs between the two types of production. For instance, if the two industries are farming and fishing it is assumed that farms can be sold to pay for the construction of fishing boats with no transaction costs.

The theory by Avsar has offered much criticism to this.

=== Factor immobility between countries ===

The basic Heckscher–Ohlin model depends upon the relative availability of capital and labor differing internationally, but if capital can be freely invested anywhere, [[competition]] (for investment) makes relative abundances identical throughout the world. Essentially, [[free trade]] in capital provides a single worldwide investment pool.

Differences in labour abundance would not produce a difference in ''relative'' factor abundance (in relation to mobile capital) because the labour/capital ratio would be identical everywhere. (A large country would receive twice as much investment as a small one, for instance, maximizing capitalist's [[return on investment]]).

As capital controls are reduced, the modern world has begun to look a lot less like the world modelled by Heckscher and Ohlin. It has been argued that capital mobility undermines the case for [[free trade]] itself, see: [[Free trade controversy#Capital mobility and comparative advantage|Capital mobility and comparative advantage Free trade critique]].

Capital is mobile when:
* There are limited [[exchange control]]s
* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) is permitted between countries, or foreigners are permitted to invest in the commercial operations of a country through a [[stock]] or [[corporate bond]] market

Like capital, labor movements are not permitted in the Heckscher–Ohlin world, since this would drive an equalization of relative abundances of the two production factors, just as in the case of capital immobility. This condition is more defensible as a description of the modern world than the assumption that capital is confined to a single country.

=== Commodity prices are the same everywhere ===

The 2x2x2 model originally placed no barriers to trade, had no [[tariff]]s, and no [[exchange control]]s (capital was immobile, but repatriation of foreign sales was costless). It was also free of transportation costs between the countries, or any other savings that would favor procuring a local supply.

If the two countries have separate [[currency|currencies]], this does not affect the model in any way—[[purchasing power parity]] applies. Since there are no transaction costs or currency issues the [[law of one price]] applies to both commodities, and consumers in either country pay exactly the same price for either good.

In Ohlin's day this assumption was a fairly neutral simplification, but economic changes and [[econometric]] research since the 1950s have shown that the local prices of goods tend to correlate with incomes when both are converted at money prices (though this is less true with traded commodities). See: [[Penn effect]].

=== Perfect internal competition ===

Neither labor nor capital has the power to affect prices or factor rates by constraining supply; a state of [[perfect competition]] exists.

== Conclusions ==
The results of this work has been the formulation of certain named conclusions arising from the assumptions inherent in the model.

===Heckscher&amp;ndash;Ohlin theorem===
{{main|Heckscher&amp;ndash;Ohlin theorem}}
Exports of a capital-abundant country come from capital-intensive industries, and labour-abundant countries import such goods, exporting labour-intensive goods in return. Competitive pressures within the H–O model produce this prediction fairly straightforwardly. Conveniently, this is an easily testable hypothesis.

===Rybczynski theorem===
{{main|Rybczynski theorem}}
When the amount of one factor of production increases, the production of the good that uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative to the increase in the factor of production, as the H–O model assumes [[perfect competition]] where price is equal to the costs of factors of production. This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two factors of production are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.

===Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem===
{{main|Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem}}
Relative changes in output goods prices drive the relative prices of the factors used to produce them. If the world price of capital-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative [[renting|rental]] rate and decreases the relative [[wage]] rate (the return on capital as against the return to labor). Also, if the price of labor-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative [[wage]] rate and decreases the relative [[renting|rental]] rate.

===Factor&amp;ndash;price equalization theorem===
{{main|Factor price equalization}}
Free and [[competitive]] trade makes factor prices converge along with traded goods prices. The FPE theorem is the most significant conclusion of the H–O model, but also has found the least agreement with the economic evidence. Neither the [[renting|rent]]al return to capital, nor the [[wage]] rates seem to consistently converge between trading partners at different levels of development.

===Implications of factor-proportion changes ===

The ''Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem'' concerns [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] rents and wages. The Magnification effect on prices considers the effect of output-goods price-changes on the real return to capital and labor. This is done by dividing the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] rates with a [[price index]], but took thirty years to develop completely because of the theoretical complexity involved. 
*The Magnification effect shows that [[trade liberalization]] actually makes the locally-scarce factor of production ''worse off'' (because increased trade makes the price index fall by less than the drop in returns to the scarce-factor induced by the ''Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem'').
*The Magnification effect on production quantity-shifts induced by endowment changes (via the [[Rybczynski theorem]]) predicts a larger proportionate shift in output-quantity than in the corresponding endowment factor shift that induced it. This has implications to both labor and capital:
**Assuming fixed capital, population growth dilutes the scarcity of labor in relation to capital. If the population growth outpaces the growth in capital by 10% this may translate into a 20% shift in the balance of employment to the labor-intensive industries.
**In the modern world, [[money]] is much more mobile than labor, so import of capital to a country almost certainly shifts the relative factor-abundances in favor of capital. The magnification effect says that a 10% increase in national capital may lead to a redistribution of labor amounting to a fifth of the entire economy (towards capital-intensive, high-tech production). Notably, employment patterns in very poor countries can be dramatically affected by a small amount of [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], in this model. (See also: [[Dutch disease]].)

==Econometric testing of H&amp;ndash;O model theorems==
Heckscher and Ohlin considered the Factor-Price Equalization theorem an econometric success because the large volume of international trade in the late 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with the convergence of commodity ''and'' factor prices worldwide.

Modern [[econometric]] estimates have shown the model to perform poorly, however, and adjustments have been suggested, most importantly the assumption that technology is not the same everywhere. This change would mean abandoning the pure H&amp;ndash;O model.

===Leontief paradox===
{{main|Leontief paradox}}
In 1954 an econometric test by [[Wassily W. Leontief]] of the H–O model found that the United States, despite having a relative abundance of capital, tended to export labor-intensive goods and import capital-intensive goods. This problem became known as the [[Leontief paradox]]. Alternative trade models and various explanations for the paradox have emerged as a result of the paradox. One such trade model, the [[Linder hypothesis]], suggests that goods are traded based on similar demand rather than differences in supply side factors (i.e., H–O's factor endowments).

===The Vanek formula===
Various attempts in the 1960s and 1970s have been made to "solve" the Leontief paradox and save the Heckscher–Ohlin Theory from failing. From the 1980s a new series of statistical tests had been tried. The new tests depended on Vanek's formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vanek |first=J. |year=1968 |title=The Factor Proportions Theory: the ''N''-Factor Case |journal=Kyklos |volume=21 |issue= 4|pages=749–756 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-6435.1968.tb00141.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a simple form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_C} = \mathbf{V_C} - s_C\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_C}&lt;/math&gt; is the net trade of factor service vector for country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_C}&lt;/math&gt; the factor endowment vector for country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_C&lt;/math&gt; the country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'s share of the world consumption and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; the world total endowment vector of factors. For many countries and many factors, it is possible to estimate the left hand sides and right hand sides independently. To put it another way, the left hand side tells the direction of factor service trade. Thus it is possible to ask how this system of equations holds. The results obtained by Bowen, Leamer and Sveiskaus (1987) was disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bowen |first=Harry P. |last2=Leamer |first2=Edward E. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Sveiskaus |first3=Leo |year=1987 |title=Multicountry, Multifactor Tests of the Factor Abundance Theory |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=791–809 |doi= |jstor=1810209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined the cases of 12 factors and 27 countries for the year 1967. They found that the both sides of the equations had the same sign only for 61% of 324 cases. For the year 1983, the result was more disastrous. Both sides had the same sign only for 148 cases out of 297 cases (or the rate of correct predictions was 49.8%). The results of Bowen, Leamer, and Sveiskaus (1987) mean that the Hecksher–Ohlin–Vanek (HOV) theory has no predictive power concerning the direction of trade.

==Criticism ==

The critical assumption of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is that the two countries are identical, except for the difference in resource endowments. This also implies that the aggregate preferences are the same. The relative abundance in capital leads the capital-abundant country to produce the capital-intensive good cheaper than the labor-abundant country, and vice versa.

Initially, when the countries are not trading:

The price of the capital-intensive good in the capital-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country,
the price of the labor-intensive good in the labor-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country.
Once trade is allowed, profit-seeking firms move their products to the markets that have (temporary) higher prices. As a result:

the capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good,
the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good.
The Leontief paradox, presented by Wassily Leontief in 1951,[1] found that the U.S. (the most capital-abundant country in the world by any criterion) exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital-intensive commodities, in apparent contradiction with the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem. However, if labor is separated into two distinct factors, skilled labor and unskilled labor, the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem is more accurate. The U.S. tends to export skilled-labor-intensive goods, and tends to import unskilled-labor-intensive goods.{{Citation |first=William |last=Miberg |year=1996 |title=The rhetoric of policy relevance in international economics |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=237–259 |doi=10.1080/13501789600000017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor predictive power===
The original Heckscher–Ohlin model and extended model such as the Vanek model performs poorly, as it is shown in the section "[[Econometric]] testing of H–O model theorems". Daniel Trefler and Susan Chun Zhu summarizes their paper that "It is hard to believe that factor endowments theory [editor's note: in other words, Heckscher–Ohlin–Vanek Model] could offer an adequate explanation of international trade patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Daniel |last=Trefler |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Susan Chun |last2=Zhu |year=2000 |title=Beyond the Algebra of Explanation: HOV for the Technology Age |journal=American Economic Review |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=145–149 |doi= 10.1257/aer.90.2.145|jstor=117209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common understanding exists that in the national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the regional data of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=D. R. |first2=D. E. |last2=Weintein |first3=S. D. |last3=Bradford |first4=K. |last4=Shimpo |year=1997 |title=Using International and Japanese Regional Data to Determine When the Factor Abundance Theory of Trade Works |journal=American Economic Review |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=421–446 |doi= |jstor=2951353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the HOV formula fits well, it does not mean that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bernstein |first=J. R. |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=D. E. |last2=Weinstein |year=2002 |title=Do endowments predict the location of production?: Evidence from national and international data |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=55–76 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(01)00108-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factor equalization theorem===

The factor equalization theorem (FET) applies only to the most advanced countries. The average wage in Japan was once as big as 70 times the wage in Vietnam. These wage discrepancies are not normally in the scope of the H–O model analysis.&lt;ref name="Chris Edwards 1985 pp. 29"&gt;{{Citation |first=Chris |last=Edwards |year=1985 |title=The fragmented world: competing perspectives on trade, money, and crisis |location=London and New York |publisher=Methuen |chapter=§2.3 The Fall of The Hecksher-Ohlin Theory |pages=29–40 |isbn=0-416-73390-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckscher–Ohlin theory is badly adapted to the analyze South-North trade problems. The assumptions of H–O are unrealistic with respect to North-South trade. Income differences between North and South is the concern that third world cares most. The factor price equalization theorem has not shown a sign of realization, even for a long time lag of a half century.&lt;ref name="Stewart1989"&gt;{{Citation |first=Frances |last=Stewart |chapter=Recent Theories of International Trade: Some Implications for the South |editor-first=Henryk |editor-last=Kierzkowski |year=1989 |title=Monopolistic Competition and International Trade |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=84–108 |isbn=0-19-828726-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identical production function===

The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model assumes that the production functions are identical for all countries concerned. This means that all countries are in the same level of production and have the same technology, yet this is highly unrealistic. Technological gap between developed and developing countries is the main concern for the development of poor countries. The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model ignores all these vital factors when one wants to consider development of less developed countries in the international context.&lt;ref name="Stewart1989" /&gt; Even between developed countries, technology differs from industry to industry and firm to firm base. Indeed, this is the very basis of the competition between firms, inside the country and across the country. See the New Trade Theory in this article below.

===Capital as endowment===

In the modern production system, machines and apparatuses play an important role. What is referred to as capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.

===Homogeneous capital===

Capital goods take different forms. It may take the form of a machine-tool such as [[lathe]], the form of a transfer-machine, which you can see under the belt-conveyors. It may take the form of oil or iron core. Despite these facts, capital in the Hechscher–Ohlin model is assumed as homogeneous and transferable to any form if necessary. This assumption is not only far from the reality, but also it includes logical flaw. Capital has a measure, just like anything has weight. How can an amount of various goods be measured?&lt;ref name="Chris Edwards 1985 pp. 29"/&gt;

Usually by a system of prices. But prices depend on profit rate. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, the [[rate of profit]] is determined according to how abundant capital is. If capital is scarce, it has a high rate of profit. If it is abundant, the profit rate is low. Here is a logical circle. Before the profit rate is determined, the amount of capital is not measured. This logical difficulty was the subject of academic controversy many years ago—sometimes called the [[Cambridge capital controversy|Cambridge Capital Controversies]]. The conclusion of the controversies was that the concept of homogeneous capital was untenable. Heckscher–Ohlin theorists ignore all these stories without providing any explanation how capital is measured theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Avi J. |last=Cohen |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Geoffrey C. |last2=Harcourt |year=2003 |title=Whatever Happened to the Cambridge Capital Theory Controversies? |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=199–214 |doi=10.1257/089533003321165010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No unemployment===

Unemployment is the vital question in any trade conflict. Heckscher–Ohlin theory excludes unemployment by the very formulation of the model, in which all factors (including labour) are employed in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiozawa |first=Y. |year=2009 |title=Samuelson's Implicit Criticism against Sraffa and the Sraffians and Two Other Questions |journal=The Kyoto Economic Review |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=19–37 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ker/78/1/78_19/_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No room for firms===
Standard Heckscher–Ohlin theory assumes the same production function for all countries. This implies that all firms are identical. The theoretical consequence is that there is no room for firms in the H–O model. By contrast, the [[New Trade Theory]] emphasizes that firms are heterogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Melitz |first=M. |authorlink=Marc Melitz |year=2003 |title=The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1695–1725 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00467 |citeseerx=10.1.1.563.6294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenaway Kneller 2007"&gt;{{Citation |last=Greenaway |first=David |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Richard |last2=Kneller |year=2007 |title=Firm heterogeneity, exporting and foreign direct investment |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=117 |issue=517 |pages=F134–F161 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political background===
From the middle of the 19th century to 1930s, giant flow of immigration took place from Europe to North America. It is estimated that more than 60 million people crossed the Atlantic Ocean. Some politicians worried if these immigrants may cause various troubles (including cultural conflicts). For those politicians HO-theory provided a good reason “in support of both restrictions on labor migration and free trade in goods”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Cris |last=Edwards |year=1985 |title=The Fragmented World, Competing Perspective on Trade, Money and Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw7ICQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT28|publisher=Methuen |location=London and New York |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives theories of trade==

===New Trade Theory===

{{main|New Trade Theory}}

New Trade theorists challenge the assumption of diminishing [[returns to scale]], and some argue that using [[protectionist]] measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries would then allow those sectors to dominate the world market via a [[network effect]].

See also [[Intra-industry trade]].

===New Trade Theory===

New Trade Theory analyses individual enterprises and plants in an international competitive situation. The classical trade theory—i.e., the Heckscher–Ohlin model—has no enterprises in mind. The new trade theory treats enterprises in an industry as identical entities. New New Trade Theory gives focus on the diversity of enterprises. It is a fact that some enterprises engage in export and some that do not. Some enterprises invest directly in the foreign country in order to produce and sell in that country. Some other enterprises engage only in export. Why does this kind of differences occur?  New Trade Theory tries to find out the reasons of these well observed facts.&lt;ref name="Greenaway Kneller 2007" /&gt;

===Gravity model of trade===
{{main|Gravity model of trade}}

The gravity model of international trade predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes of two nations, and the distance between them.

===Ricardo–Sraffa trade theory===

''See also'': ''[[David Ricardo#The Ricardian theory of international trade|The Ricardian Theory of International Trade]]''

Ricardian theory is now extended in a general form to include not only labor, but also inputs of materials and intermediate goods. In this sense, it is much more general and plausible than the Heckscher–Ohlin model and escapes the logical problems such as capital as endowments, which is, in reality, produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiozawa |first=Y. |year=2007 |title=A New Construction of Ricardian Trade Theory—A Many-country, Many-commodity Case with Intermediate Goods and Choice of Production Techniques |journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=141–187 |doi= 10.14441/eier.3.141|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/eier/3/2/3_141/_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the theory permits different production processes to coexist in an industry of a country, the Ricardo–Sraffa theory can give a theoretical bases for the New Trade Theory.

The '''immigrant paradox''' is that recent [[Immigrant generations|immigrants]] often outperform more established immigrants and non-immigrants on a number of health-, education-, and conduct- or crime-related outcomes, despite the numerous barriers they face to successful social integration.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the UN, the number of first-generation [[Immigration|immigrants worldwide]] is 244&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These large-scale population changes worldwide have led many scholars, across fields, to study the [[acculturation]] and adjustment of immigrants to their new homes. Specifically, researchers have examined immigrant experiences as they pertain to [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Mental health|mental]] and [[Health|physical]] health, and conduct/crime.

Researchers have tried to understand why later generations seem to perform less well than their forebears. They have found that it can be explained by non-optimal [[methodology]] and differences in the way generations are modified by the host culture.

== Challenges facing immigrants ==
Immigrants face many challenges as a result of migration, stemming from the fact that the nations and communities they settle in are culturally unfamiliar. As a result, they find themselves in an unwelcoming environment lacking in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a simple transition. Additionally, because general attitudes of the host society are often hostile and xenophobic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=S.

Discrimination and prejudice are common and dictate daily experiences with individuals and organizations within the host society. For example, although cultural sensitivity training is increasingly a required component of medical education, immigrants have historically faced and continue to face discrimination in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauderdale|first=Diane S.|last2=Wen|first2=Ming|last3=Jacobs|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Kandula|first4=Namratha R.|title=Immigrant Perceptions of Discrimination in Health Care|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00005650-200610000-00005|journal=Medical Care|volume=44|issue=10|pages=914–920|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000220829.87073.f7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An added barrier to equitable access to health care comes as a result of many immigrants' limited English proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woloshin|first=Steven|date=1995-03-01|title=Language Barriers in Medicine in the United States|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=273|issue=9|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health care facilities have inadequate interpretation services, and culturally sensitive health care providers are also scarce.

Many immigrants also settle in ''de facto'' segregated, low-income neighborhoods and [[ethnic enclave]]s, especially during periods of high immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iceland|first=John|last2=Scopilliti|first2=Melissa|date=2008-02-01|title=Immigrant residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1990–2000|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353/dem.2008.0009|journal=Demography|volume=45|issue=1|pages=79–94|doi=10.1353/dem.2008.0009|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the benefits of living in such communities include increased social support, positive in-group relations, and the virtual elimination of cultural and language barriers in daily interaction, often such neighborhoods are targets of institutional violence, such as [[Frisking|stop and frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelman|first=Andrew|last2=Fagan|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Kiss|first3=Alex|date=2007-09-01|title=An Analysis of the New York City Police Department's "Stop-and-Frisk" Policy in the Context of Claims of Racial Bias|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001040|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=102|issue=479|pages=813–823|doi=10.1198/016214506000001040|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, due to public education funding policies in the United States, funds are often allocated to schools based on neighborhood property taxes. As a result, many immigrant children attend schools that are understaffed, underfunded, and lacking in resources in comparison to the schools of their more affluent peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/|title=Students of Color Are Much More Likely to Attend Schools Where Most of Their Peers Are Poor|last=Brownstein|first=Janie Boschma and Ronald|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/|title=Good School, Rich School; Bad School, Poor School|last=Semuels|first=Alana|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the opportunity gap, by which low-income and marginalized groups have disproportionately low access to the opportunities and conveniences afforded to societally privileged groups, resulting in group-wide disparities in academic achievement, wages, and political power. In direct relation to these obstacles, immigrants also face challenges in the workplace, including poor and dangerous working conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ORRENIUS|first=PIA M.|last2=ZAVODNY|first2=MADELINE|date=August 2009|title=Do Immigrants Work In Riskier Jobs?|journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–551|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943}}&lt;/ref&gt; unemployment, and the employment of highly skilled individuals in low-skill jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Jennifer Asanin|last2=Wilson|first2=Kathi|date=2009-04-01|title=‘Education?

To compound all of these issues, the burden of acculturation is an added stressor. Navigating the divide between the heritage culture and the culture of the new society is difficult, as the traditions, beliefs, and norms of these two cultures are often in direct conflict. This challenge is only compounded by the other obstacles immigrants are faced with, and has deleterious consequences for mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirin|first=Selcuk R.|last2=Ryce|first2=Patrice|last3=Gupta|first3=Taveeshi|last4=Rogers-Sirin|first4=Lauren|title=The role of acculturative stress on mental health symptoms for immigrant adolescents: A longitudinal investigation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0028398|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|pages=736–748|doi=10.1037/a0028398}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because many migrants and refugees are already susceptible to elevated levels of [[psychopathology]], due to the trauma associated with interpersonal conflict, acculturative stress and/or political unrest in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobasher|first=Mohsen|date=2016-07-27|title=Cultural Trauma and Ethnic Identity Formation Among Iranian Immigrants in the United States|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764206289656|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=50|issue=1|pages=100–117|doi=10.1177/0002764206289656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaltman|first=Stacey|last2=Green|first2=Bonnie L.|last3=Mete|first3=Mihriye|last4=Shara|first4=Nawar|last5=Miranda|first5=Jeanne|title=Trauma, depression, and comorbid PTSD/depression in a community sample of Latina immigrants.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0018952|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1037/a0018952|pmc=2850073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=Zachary|last2=Silove|first2=Derrick|last3=Bird|first3=Kevin|last4=McGorry|first4=Patrick|last5=Mohan|first5=P.|date=1999-07-01|title=Pathways from War Trauma to Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Among Tamil Asylum Seekers, Refugees, and Immigrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024710902534|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=12|issue=3|pages=421–435|doi=10.1023/A:1024710902534|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these obstacles, it is expected that recent immigrants would have outcomes inferior to those of their native-born or non-immigrant peers.

== Paradoxical findings ==
Despite the numerous challenges facing early generation immigrants, research on the mental and physical health, educational, and conduct-related outcomes of these populations has demonstrated a [[paradoxical]] pattern.

=== Mental health outcomes ===
Research with Filipino Americans has demonstrated that first-generation immigrants had lower levels of depressive symptoms than subsequent, US-born generations.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; First-generation Mexican immigrants to the United States were found to have lower incidences of mood disorders and substance use than their bicultural or subsequent generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnam|first=M.

=== Physical health outcomes ===
The immigrant paradox also extends to physical health, with recent immigrants having better outcomes than US-born individuals. One study of several thousand health records in Southern California found Asian and Latina women had better perinatal outcomes than both white and Black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voelker|first=Rebecca|date=1994-12-21|title=Born in the USA: Infant Health Paradox|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=272|issue=23|doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asian and Latina women had lower infant mortality, higher birth weight, fewer [[Caesarean section]]s, fewer medical diagnoses during delivery, and shorter hospitalizations. This finding has also been replicated in Spain, with immigrant mothers, barring those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n origin, having a lower frequency of low birth weight than native Spanish mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speciale|first=Anna Maria|last2=Regidor|first2=Enrique|date=2011-06-01|title=Understanding the Universality of the Immigrant Health Paradox: The Spanish Perspective|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-010-9365-1|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=518–525|doi=10.1007/s10903-010-9365-1|issn=1557-1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to overweight and obesity, it has been found that first-generation Mexican American women had healthier diets than both non-Latino whites and second-generation Mexican American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|last2=Abrams|first2=B|date=1995-01-01|title=Dietary intake among Mexican-American women: generational differences and a comparison with white non-Hispanic women.|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.85.1.20|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=85|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.1.20|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, second-generation women had the poorest dietary intake, consuming even smaller amounts of necessary nutrients than non-Latina white women. US-born immigrants (i.e., second-generation immigrants, and subsequent generations) have also been found to engage in more overweight-related behaviours, such as poor diet, smoking, and little physical activity, in comparison to foreign-born immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon-Larsen|first=Penny|last2=Harris|first2=Kathleen Mullan|last3=Ward|first3=Dianne S|last4=Popkin|first4=Barry M|title=Acculturation and overweight-related behaviors among Hispanic immigrants to the US: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953603000728|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=57|issue=11|pages=2023–2034|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(03)00072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Cubans and Puerto Ricans, increased length of stay in the United States was also associated with increased presence of overweight.

=== Educational outcomes ===
Among Latino populations, first- and second-generation Latino adolescents report high levels of effort in school, with effort declining across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aretakis|first=Maria T.|last2=Ceballo|first2=Rosario|last3=Suarez|first3=Gloria A.|last4=Camacho|first4=Tissyana C.|title=Investigating the immigrant paradox and Latino adolescents’ academic attitudes.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/lat0000031|journal=Journal of Latina/o Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=56–69|doi=10.1037/lat0000031}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also place a greater value upon education, with the same downhill trend being observed.

== A special case: the immigrant paradox in refugees? ==
There is a general consensus that [[refugee]]s are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to successful [[Third country resettlement|resettlement]] in the host society, as the same [[Immigrant paradox#Challenges facing immigrants|challenges]] voluntary immigrants face are generally aggravated for refugees. However, some research has found evidence of a paradox, with refugees at least three times less likely to engage in substance use than non-immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salas-Wright|first=Christopher P.|last2=Vaughn|first2=Michael G.|title=A "refugee paradox" for substance use disorders?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871614009168|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=142|pages=345–349|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found refugees to Denmark to have a lower likelihood of stroke and breast cancer compared to Danish natives, but higher likelihood of lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norredam|first=Marie|last2=Agyemang|first2=Charles|last3=Hoejbjerg Hansen|first3=Oluf K.|last4=Petersen|first4=Jørgen H.|last5=Byberg|first5=Stine|last6=Krasnik|first6=Allan|last7=Kunst|first7=Anton E.|date=2014-08-01|title=Duration of residence and disease occurrence among refugees and family reunited immigrants: test of the ‘healthy migrant effect’ hypothesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.12340/abstract|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|volume=19|issue=8|pages=958–967|doi=10.1111/tmi.12340|issn=1365-3156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, levels of all of these diseases among refugee populations eventually converged to the same levels as Danish natives with increased length of residency.

There may also be an immigrant paradox for the perinatal outcomes of refugees, with the majority of refugee women studied having a lower [[Birth rate|crude birth rate]], infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and percentage of low birth weight than women in both their host country and their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Michelle|date=2002-08-07|title=Reproductive Health Indicators and Outcomes Among Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons in Postemergency Phase Camps|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|journal=JAMA|volume=288|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
There is some doubt among scholars as to whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, with some findings conflicting with the body of research on immigrant outcomes. For example, among Asian Americans, [[limited English proficiency]] was consistently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In addition to language proficiency, age at time of immigration is also an important factor, with older first-generation Mexican American youth more likely to drop out of school than their US-born and younger, first-generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landale|first=Nancy S.|last2=Oropesa|first2=R.S.|last3=Llanes|first3=Daniel|title=Schooling, Work, and Idleness among Mexican and Non-Latino White Adolescents|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/ssre.1998.0631|journal=Social Science Research|volume=27|issue=4|pages=457–480|doi=10.1006/ssre.1998.0631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further support of this conclusion, data from the [[Current Population Survey|CPS]] shows that immigrating as a teenager is associated with completing less schooling than immigrating before or after adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiswick|first=Barry R.|last2=DebBurman|first2=Noyna|date=2004-08-01|title=Educational attainment: analysis by immigrant generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775703001043|journal=Economics of Education Review|series=Special Issue In Honor of Lewis C. Solman|volume=23|issue=4|pages=361–379|doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2003.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS data also shows that second-generation immigrants completed more schooling than both foreign-born immigrants and non-immigrant US-born individuals.

In international research on the phenomenon, Europe's [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe|SHARE]] data demonstrated no evidence of a paradox, with immigrants having poorer health outcomes than native Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solé-Auró|first=Aïda|last2=Crimmins|first2=Eileen M.|date=2008-12-01|title=Health of Immigrants in European Countries1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2008.00150.x/abstract|journal=International Migration Review|volume=42|issue=4|pages=861–876|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2008.00150.x|issn=1747-7379}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Canada found that recent and non-European immigrant women were more predisposed to developing [[postpartum depression]] than non-immigrant Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urquia|first=Marcelo L.|last2=O'Campo|first2=Patricia J.|last3=Heaman|first3=Maureen I.|date=2012-05-01|title=Revisiting the immigrant paradox in reproductive health: The roles of duration of residence and ethnicity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612001839|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=10|pages=1610–1621|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== Acculturation and the erosion of protective factors ===
The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations. These include stronger social networks and highly adaptive cultural practices concerning religion, diet, substance use, and parenting style.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7|title=Latinas/os in the United States: Changing the Face of América|last=Acevedo-Garcia|first=Dolores|last2=Bates|first2=Lisa M.|date=2008|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387719412|pages=101–113|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harker|first=Kathryn|date=2000–2001|title=Immigrant Generation, Assimilation, and Adolescent Psychological Well-Being|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf79&amp;div=42&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=uMlrSOoLQo4AAAAA:BVv50TMN4gEYETcl44cdzUNOydpsNfMnlkLWcDcA-hsH2xnZm4f79JrvKr_-F0vj4jzxycA&amp;collection=journals|journal=Social Forces|volume=79|pages=969–1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also posit that first-generation immigrants are more likely to place high importance upon academic success due to fear of limited employment opportunities in the host society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Angel L.|last2=Jamison|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Trujillo|first3=Monica H.|title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002716208322765|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=620|issue=1|pages=90–114|doi=10.1177/0002716208322765}}&lt;/ref&gt; These protective factors result in superior lifetime health, educational, financial, and conduct-related outcomes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, by having access to multiple cultural frameworks, recent immigrants are able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between frameworks or engage in downward [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]] as methods of self-protection.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suárez-Orozco|first=Carola|last2=Carhill|first2=Avary|date=2008-09-01|title=Afterword: New directions in research with immigrant families and their children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cd.224/abstract|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=2008|issue=121|pages=87–104|doi=10.1002/cd.224|issn=1534-8687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, subsequent generations may not have access to such social and cultural capital, having been socialized into the norms and expectations of the host society (i.e., consuming more processed and unhealthy foods, having a smaller network of same-ethnicity peers, increased substance use). Further, intergenerational conflict is more likely between first-generation immigrants and their second-generation children due to differing cultural practices, with parents being accustomed to the norms of their culture of origin and children having been socialized into the norms of the host society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This type of conflict has been linked to poorer outcomes for children.

A third cost of acculturation is linked to immigrant children's cultural [[Socialization#Racial socialization|socialization]]. A strong sense of ethnic identity and pride in one's cultural heritage is generally understood to be protective from negative mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossakowski|first=Krysia N.|date=2003|title=Coping with Perceived Discrimination: Does Ethnic Identity Protect Mental Health?|jstor=1519782|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=318–331|doi=10.2307/1519782}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with increased length of stay in the host society, subsequent generations are likely to report decreasing levels of involvement in culturally important traditions and practices. With this comes decreasing strength of ethnic identity. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to endorse meritocratic views, which is similarly correlated with decreasing strength of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiley|first=Shaun|last2=Deaux|first2=Kay|last3=Hagelskamp|first3=Carolin|title=Born in the USA: How immigrant generation shapes meritocracy and its relation to ethnic identity and collective action.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027661|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1037/a0027661}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributes are all associated with poorer mental health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Thelma|last2=Somody|first2=Catherine|date=2011-07-05|title=The Role of Relational-Cultural Theory in Mental Health Counseling|url=https://doi.org/10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=33|issue=3|pages=223–242|doi=10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible benefits of ethnic enclaves ====
:See: [[Hispanic paradox#Barrio advantage|Barrio advantage]]
First-generation immigrants often settle in ethnic enclaves, which carry a host of advantages. Residents of these neighborhoods have access to a strong and supportive network of same-ethnicity peers and potential access to culturally sensitive healthcare providers that may allow for increased financial gain and better physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazumdar|first=Sanjoy|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Shampa|last3=Docuyanan|first3=Faye|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Colette Marie|date=|title=Creating a sense of place: the Vietnamese-Americans and Little Saigon|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494400901701|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=319–333|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Joshua S.|last2=Kagawa-Singer|first2=Marjorie|date=2007-07-30|title=Increasing Access to Care for Cultural and Linguistic Minorities: Ethnicity-Specific Health Care Organizations and Infrastructure|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218627|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=3|pages=532–549|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0073|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry R.|first=Chiswick|last2=Miller|first2=Paul W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Do Enclaves Matter in Immigrant Adjustment?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x/abstract|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=4|issue=1|pages=5–35|doi=10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x|issn=1540-6040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic enclaves also eliminate the challenges associated with language barriers, with residents often sharing linguistic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Thomas|last2=Epstein|first2=Gil S.|last3=Gang|first3=Ira N.|date=2005-11-01|title=Enclaves, language, and the location choice of migrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=18|issue=4|pages=649–662|doi=10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|issn=0933-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthy immigrant selection ===
Another common explanation for the immigrant paradox is that the vast majority of superior outcomes among early generations of immigrants can be accounted for by a selection effect. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that only the most psychologically and physically healthy individuals migrate from their country of origin, and therefore have superior outcomes to begin with.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Methodological concerns ===
Much of the literature on the immigrant paradox in mental health relies on self-report data. This may be problematic in that certain populations may differentially interpret questions in ways that are meaningful and result in significant disparities between groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, many measures view mental health solely through a Western lens, accounting only for the types of symptoms commonly expressed in Western societies.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This may result in the underreporting of poor mental health among non-Western populations.

Another issue in research on immigrants is the grouping of highly diverse ethnic groups together in monolithic racial categories,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; namely the pan-ethnic "Asian" and "Latino" categories. Much of the research on Latinos and the immigrant paradox has been conducted with Mexican American populations, ignoring the fact that there are 32 other countries that fall under the Latin American label. Similarly, much research on Asian Americans has been conducted with [[East Asia]]n populations, ignoring the differential treatment and experiences of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns, and the different refugee status of individuals across Asia (examples include [[Bhutanese refugees|Lhotshampa]] refugees, who are of South Asian heritage, and Cambodian refugees, who are of Southeast Asian heritage). Such groupings are problematic in that they erase the large diversity in [[socioeconomic status]], educational background, and historical trauma of each of these ethnic groups – factors which all contribute to the consequent positive or negative outcomes of immigrants.

== Future directions in immigrant research ==
Carola Suárez-Orozco, Ph.D. calls for increased research on the psychology of immigrants paying attention to differences in refugee status, documentation status, gender, and ethnic group (in lieu of using pan-ethnic groupings).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Research must also consider seasonal migrants, the differential [[racialization]] of ethnic groups, and the role of English proficiency on educational and health outcomes.

'''Inclusive fitness in humans''' is the application of [[inclusive fitness]] theory to human social behaviour, relationships and cooperation.

Inclusive fitness theory (and the related [[kin selection]] theory) are general theories in [[evolutionary biology]] that propose a method to understand the evolution of social behaviours in organisms. While various ideas related to these theories have been influential in the study of the social behaviour of non-human organisms, their application to human behaviour has been debated.

Inclusive fitness theory is broadly understood to describe a ''statistical'' criterion by which social traits can ''evolve'' to become widespread in a population of organisms. However, beyond this some scientists have interpreted the theory to make predictions about how the ''expression'' of social behavior is mediated in both humans and other animals – typically that genetic relatedness determines the expression of social behaviour. Other biologists and anthropologists maintain that beyond its statistical evolutionary relevance the theory does not necessarily imply that genetic relatedness ''per se'' determines the ''expression'' of social behavior in organisms. Instead, the expression of social behavior may be mediated by correlated conditions, such as shared location, shared rearing environment, &lt;!--should this item have an "and" before it, as last item in the list? Let us allow that the word 'or' here provides the grammatical conjunction--&gt;familiarity or other contextual cues which correlate with shared genetic relatedness, thus meeting the statistical evolutionary criteria without being deterministic. While the former position still attracts controversy, the latter position has a better empirical fit with anthropological data about human [[kinship]] practices, and is accepted by cultural anthropologists.

==History==

Applying evolutionary biology perspectives to humans and human society has often resulted in periods of controversy and debate, due to their apparent incompatibility with alternative perspectives about humanity. Examples of early controversies include the [[Reactions to On the Origin of Species|reactions to ''On the Origin of Species'']], and the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Examples of later controversies more directly connected with inclusive fitness theory and its use in [[sociobiology]] include physical confrontations at meetings of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] and more often intellectual arguments such as Sahlins' 1976 book ''The use and abuse of biology'', Lewontin et al.'s 1984 ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', and Kitcher's 1985 ''Vaulting Ambition:Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature''. Some of these later arguments were produced by other scientists, including biologists and anthropologists, against Wilson's 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'', which was influenced by (though not necessarily endorsed by) Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness theory.

A key debate in applying inclusive fitness theory to humans has been between biologists and anthropologists around the extent to which human [[kinship]] relationships (considered to be a large component of human solidarity and altruistic activity and practice) are necessarily based on or influenced by genetic relationships or blood-ties ('consanguinity'). The position of most [[Social anthropology|social anthropologists]] is summarized by Sahlins (1976), that for humans "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' [kin] vary independently of consanguinal distance and that these categories organize actual social practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;112). Biologists wishing to apply the theory to humans directly disagree, arguing that "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' do not 'vary independently of consanguinal distance', not in any society on earth." (Daly et al. 1997, p282).

This disagreement is central because of the way the association between blood ties/genetic relationships and altruism are conceptualized by many biologists. It is frequently understood by biologists that inclusive fitness theory makes predictions about ''how behaviour is mediated'' in both humans and other animals. For example, a recent experiment conducted on humans by the evolutionary psychologist [[Robin Dunbar]] and colleagues was, as they understood it, designed "to test the prediction that altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule" (inclusive fitness theory) and more specifically that "If participants follow Hamilton's rule, investment (time for which the [altruistic] position was held) should increase with the recipient's relatedness to the participant. In effect, we tested whether investment flows differentially down channels of relatedness." From their results, they concluded that "''human altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule ... humans behave in such a way as to maximize inclusive fitness: they are more willing to benefit closer relatives than more distantly related individuals.''" (Madsen et al. 2007). This position continues to be rejected by social anthropologists as being incompatible with the large amount of ethnographic data on kinship and altruism that their discipline has collected over many decades, that demonstrates that in many human cultures, kinship relationships (accompanied by altruism) do not necessarily map closely onto genetic relationships.

Whilst the above understanding of inclusive fitness theory as necessarily making predictions about how human kinship and altruism is mediated is common amongst evolutionary psychologists, other biologists and anthropologists have argued that it is at best a limited (and at worst a mistaken) understanding of inclusive fitness theory. These scientists argue that the theory is better understood as simply describing an ''evolutionary'' criterion for the emergence of altruistic behaviour, which is explicitly statistical in character, not as predictive of ''proximate'' or ''mediating'' mechanisms of altruistic behaviour, which may not necessarily be determined by genetic relatedness (or blood ties) ''per se''. These alternative non-deterministic and non-reductionist understandings of inclusive fitness theory and human behavior have been argued to be compatible with anthropologists' decades of data on human kinship, and compatible with anthropologists' perspectives on human kinship. This position (e.g. [[nurture kinship]]) has been largely accepted by social anthropologists, whilst the former position (still held by evolutionary psychologists, see above) remains rejected by social anthropologists.

== Theoretical background ==
{{see also|Inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}

===Theoretical overview ===

Inclusive fitness theory, first proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]] in the early 1960s, proposes a selective criterion for the potential evolution of social traits in organisms, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism's survival and reproduction could nevertheless emerge under certain conditions. The key condition relates to the statistical likelihood that significant benefits of a social trait or behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait. [[Inclusive fitness]] theory is a general treatment of the statistical probabilities of social traits accruing to any other organisms likely to propagate a copy of the same social trait. [[Kin selection]] theory treats the narrower but more straightforward case of the benefits accruing to close genetic relatives (or what biologists call 'kin') who may also carry and propagate the trait. Under conditions where the social trait sufficiently correlates (or more properly, ''regresses'') with other likely bearers, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an "altruism gene" (or complex of genes or heritable factors) that influence an organism's behavior in such a way that is helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior can also increase the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. In formal terms, if such a complex of genes arises, Hamilton's rule (rb&gt;c) specifies the selective criteria (in terms of relatedness (r), cost (c) benefit (b)) for such a trait to increase in frequency in the population (see [[Inclusive fitness]] for more details). Hamilton noted that inclusive fitness theory does not by itself predict that a given species will necessarily evolve such altruistic behaviors, since an opportunity or context for interaction between individuals is a more primary and necessary requirement in order for any social interaction to occur in the first place. As Hamilton put it, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start." (Hamilton 1987, 420).&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;Hamilton, W.D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In ''Kin recognition in animals'', edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies a set of necessary criteria for the evolution of certain altruistic traits, it does not specify a sufficient condition for their evolution in any given species, since the typical ecology, demographics and life pattern of the species must also allow for social interactions between individuals to occur, before any potential elaboration of social traits can evolve in regard to those interactions.

===Initial presentations of the theory===

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s, see ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]'') focused on making the general mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution. However, since many [[Ethology|field biologists]] mainly use theory as a guide to their observations and analysis of empirical phenomena, Hamilton also speculated about possible proximate behavioural mechanisms that might be observable in organisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to [[inclusive fitness]] would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964 1–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1964 |title=[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]] |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton here was suggesting two broad proximate mechanisms by which social traits might meet the criterion of correlation specified by the theory:

'''[[Kin recognition]] (active discrimination)''': if a social trait enables an organism to distinguish between different degrees of genetic relatedness when interacting in a mixed population,  and to discriminate (positively) in performing social behaviours on the basis of detecting genetic relatedness, then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough to meet the criterion. In another section of the same paper (page 54) Hamilton considered whether 'supergenes' that identify copies of themselves in others might evolve to give more accurate information about genetic relatedness. He later (1987, see below) considered this to be wrong-headed and withdrew the suggestion.

'''Viscous populations (spatial cues)''': even indiscriminate altruism may achieve the correlation in 'viscous' populations where individuals have low rates of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] or short distances of dispersal from their home range (their location of birth). Here, social partners are typically genealogically closely related, and so altruism can flourish even in the absence of [[kin recognition]] and kin discrimination faculties – spatial proximity and circumstantial cues provide the necessary correlation.

These two alternative suggestions had important effects on how field biologists understood the theory and what they looked for in the behavior of organisms. Within a few years biologists were looking for evidence that 'kin recognition' mechanisms might occur in organisms, assuming this was a necessary prediction of inclusive fitness theory, leading to a sub-field of 'kin recognition' research.

===Later theoretical refinements===
{{See also|kin recognition}}

A common source of confusion around inclusive fitness theory is that Hamilton's early analysis included some inaccuracies, that, ''although corrected by him in later publications'', are often not fully understood by other researchers who attempt to apply inclusive fitness to understanding organisms' behaviour. For example, Hamilton had initially suggested that the statistical correlation in his formulation could be understood by a correlation coefficient of genetic relatedness, but quickly accepted [[George R. Price|George Price's]] correction that a general regression coefficient was the more relevant metric, and together they published corrections in 1970. A related confusion is the connection between inclusive fitness and [[multi-level selection]], which are often incorrectly assumed to be mutually exclusive theories. The regression coefficient helps to clarify this connection:

{{quote|Because of the way it was first explained, the approach using inclusive fitness has often been identified with 'kin selection' and presented strictly as an alternative to 'group selection'. But the foregoing discussion shows that kinship should be considered just one way of getting positive regression of genotype in the recipient, and that it is this positive regression that is vitally necessary for altruism. Thus the inclusive-fitness concept is more general than 'kin selection'.(Hamilton 1996 [1975], 337)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1975 |title=Innate social aptitudes of man: an approach from evolutionary genetics |journal=Biosocial anthropology |volume=133 |pages=155 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton also later modified his thinking about likely mediating mechanisms whereby social traits achieve the necessary correlation with genetic relatedness. Specifically he corrected his earlier speculations that an innate ability (and 'supergenes') to recognise actual genetic relatedness was a likely mediating mechanism for kin altruism:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees. (Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"/&gt;}}

The point about inbreeding avoidance is significant, since the whole genome of sexual organisms benefits from avoiding close inbreeding; there is a different selection pressure at play compared to the selection pressure on social traits (see [[Kin recognition]] for more information).

{{quote|It does not follow… that ability to discriminate degrees of relatedness automatically implies that kin selection is the model relevant to its origin. In fact, since even earlier than Darwin, it had been realised that most organisms tend to avoid closely inbred matings. The reasons must have to do with the function of sexuality and this is not quite yet resolved (see e.g. Bell, 1982; Shields, 1982; Hamilton, 1982); but whatever the function is, here must be another set of reasons for discriminating. Some animals clearly do use discrimination for purposes of mate selection. Japanese quail for example evidently use an early imprinting of their chick companions towards obtaining, much later, preferred degrees of consanguinity in their mates (Bateson 1983). (Hamilton 1987, 419)}}

Since Hamiton's 1964 speculations about active discrimination mechanisms (above), other theorists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] had clarified that there would be negative selection pressure against mechanisms for genes to recognize copies of themselves in other individuals and discriminate socially between them on this basis. Dawkins used his '[[Green-beard effect|Green beard]]' thought experiment, where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there would be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed via [[Meiotic Drive|meitoic drive]].

===Ongoing misconceptions===

Hamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed, and because of the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition, some theorists have later tried to clarify the position:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991).  In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways – kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971,1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p.243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;West et al. 2011. Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans. Evolution and Social Behaviour 32 (2011) 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The assumption that 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' has obscured the more parsimonious possibility that spatial-cue-based mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context are commonly found in many organisms that have been studied, including in social mammal species. As Hamilton pointed out, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start" (Hamilton 1987, see above section). Since a reliable context of interaction between social actors is always a [[necessary condition]] for social traits to emerge, a reliable context of interaction is necessarily present to be leveraged by context-dependent cues to mediate social behaviours. Focus on mediating mechanisms of limited dispersal and reliable developmental context has allowed significant progress in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety of species, including humans,&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;Holland, Maximilian. (2012) ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of cue-based mediation of [[Social bonding and nurture kinship|social bonding and social behaviours]] (see below).

== Mammal evidence ==

In [[mammal]]s, as well as in other species, [[ecological niche]] and demographic conditions strongly shape typical contexts of interaction between individuals, including the frequency and circumstances surrounding the interactions between genetic relatives. Although mammals exist in a wide variety of ecological conditions and varying demographic arrangements, certain contexts of interaction between genetic relatives are nevertheless reliable enough for selection to act upon. New born mammals are often immobile and always totally dependent (socially dependent if you will) on their carer(s) for nursing with nutrient rich milk and for protection. This fundamental social dependence is a fact of life for all mammals, including humans. These conditions lead to a reliable spatial context in which there is a statistical association of replica genes between a reproductive female and her infant offspring (and has been evolutionary typical) for most mammal species. Beyond this natal context, extended possibilities for frequent interaction between related individuals are more variable and depend on group living vs. solitary living, mating patterns, duration of pre-maturity development, dispersal patterns, and more. For example, in group living [[primate]]s with females remaining in their natal group for their entire lives, there will be lifelong opportunities for interactions between female individuals related through their mothers and grandmothers etc. These conditions also thus provide a spatial-context for cue-based mechanisms to mediate social behaviours.

{{quote|The most widespread and important mechanism for kin recognition in mammals appears to be familiarity through prior association (Bekoff, 1981; Sherman, 1980). During development, individuals learn and respond to cues from the most familiar or most commonly encountered conspecifics in their environment. Individuals respond to familiar individuals as kin and unfamiliar individuals as nonkin. (Erhart et al. 1997, 153–154)}}

{{quote|Mammalian young are born into a wide variety of social situations, ranging from being isolated from all other individuals except their mother (and possibly other siblings) to being born into large social groups. Although siblings do interact in a wide variety of species having different life histories, there are certain conditions, almost all of which have to do with the developmental environment, that will favor a biased occurrence of interactions between littermates and/or different-aged siblings. It will be argued later that it is these, and perhaps other, conditions that ''predispose'' (in a probabilistic way) siblings to interact with one another. However, if two (or more) very young unrelated individuals (assume conspecifics for simplicity) are exposed to these conditions, they too will behave like siblings. That is, although [relatedness] and [familiarity] are tightly linked in many mammals, it is [familiarity] that can override [relatedness], rather than the reverse. (Bekoff 1981, 309)}}

In addition to the above examples, a wide variety of evidence from mammal species supports the finding that shared context and familiarity mediate social bonding, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; Cross-fostering studies (placing unrelated young in a shared developmental environment) strongly demonstrate that unrelated individuals bond and cooperate just as would normal littermates. The evidence therefore demonstrates that bonding and cooperation are mediated by proximity, shared context and familiarity, not via active recognition of genetic relatedness. This is problematic for those biologists who wish to claim that inclusive fitness theory predicts that social cooperation is ''mediated'' via genetic relatedness, rather than understanding the theory simply to state that social traits can ''evolve'' under conditions where there is ''statistical'' association of genetically related organisms. The former position sees the expression of cooperative behaviour as more or less deterministically caused by genetic relatedness, where the latter position does not. The distinction between cooperation mediated by shared context, and cooperation mediated by genetic relatedness ''per se'', has significant implications for whether inclusive fitness theory can be seen as compatible with the anthropological evidence on human social patterns or not. The ''shared context'' perspective is largely compatible, the ''genetic relatedness'' perspective is not (see below).

==Human kinship and cooperation==

The debate about how to interpret the implications of Inclusive fitness theory for human social cooperation has paralleled some of the key misunderstandings outlined above.  Initially, evolutionary biologists interested in humans wrongly assumed that in the human case, 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' along with their colleagues studying other species (see West et al., above). In other words, many biologists assumed that strong social bonds accompanied by altruism and cooperation in human societies (long studied by the anthropological field of kinship) were necessarily built upon recognizing genetic relatedness (or 'blood ties'). This seemed to fit well with historical research in anthropology originating in the nineteenth century (see [[Kinship#History of kinship studies|history of kinship]]) that often assumed that human kinship was built upon a recognition of shared blood ties.

However, independently of the emergence of inclusive fitness theory, from 1960s onwards many anthropologists themselves had reexamined the balance of findings in their own ethnographic data and had begun to reject the notion that human kinship is 'caused by' blood ties (see [[Kinship]]). Anthropologists have gathered very extensive [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] data on human social patterns and behaviour over a century or more, from a wide spectrum of different cultural groups. The data demonstrates that many cultures do not consider 'blood ties' (in the genealogical sense) to underlie their close social relationships and kinship bonds. Instead social bonds are often considered to be based on location-based shared circumstances including living together (co-residence), sleeping close together, working together, sharing food (commensality) and other forms of shared life together. Comparative anthropologists have shown&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; that these aspects of shared circumstances are a significant component of what influences kinship in most human cultures, notwithstanding whether or not 'blood ties' are necessarily present (see [[Nurture kinship]], below).

Although blood ties (and genetic relatedness) often correlate with kinship, just as in the case of mammals (above section), evidence from human societies suggests that it is not the genetic relatedness ''per se'' that is the mediating mechanism of social bonding and cooperation, instead it is the shared context (albeit typically consisting of genetic relatives) and the familiarity that arises from it, that mediate the social bonds. This implies that genetic relatedness is not the ''determining mechanism'' nor required for the formation of social bonds in kinship groups, or for the expression of altruism in humans, even if statistical correlations of genetic relatedness are an ''evolutionary criterion'' for the emergence of such social traits in biological organisms over evolutionary timescales. Understanding this distinction between the ''statistical role of genetic relatedness in the evolution of social traits'' and yet its ''lack of necessary determining role in mediating mechanisms of social bonding and the expression of altruism'' is key to inclusive fitness theory's proper application to human social behaviour (as well as to other mammals).

===Nurture kinship===
{{Main article|Nurture kinship}}

Compatible with biologists' emphasis on familiarity and shared context mediating social bonds, the concept of [[nurture kinship]] in the anthropological study of human social relationships highlights the extent to which such relationships are brought into being through the performance of various acts of sharing, acts of care and performance of [[nurture]] between individuals who live in close proximity. Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. The concept stands in contrast to the earlier anthropological concepts of human kinship relations being fundamentally based on "blood ties", some other form of shared substance, or a proxy for these (as in [[fictive kinship]]), and the accompanying notion that people universally understand their social relationships predominantly in these terms.

The nurture kinship perspective on the ontology of social ties, and how people conceptualize them, has become stronger in the wake of [[David M. Schneider]]'s influential ''Critique of the Study of Kinship''&lt;sup&gt;[[Nurture kinship|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and Holland's subsequent ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological approaches'', demonstrating that as well as the ethnographic record, ''biological theory and evidence'' also more strongly support the ''nurture'' perspective than the ''blood'' perspective. Both Schneider and Holland argue that the earlier ''blood'' theory of kinship derived from an unwarranted extension of symbols and values from anthropologists' own cultures (see [[ethnocentrism]]).

In economics, the '''Jevons paradox''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|v|ə|n|z}}; sometimes '''Jevons effect''') occurs when [[technological change|technological progress]] or government policy increases the [[efficiency]] with which a [[resource (economics)|resource]] is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that resource rises due to increasing [[demand (economics)|demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer |first1=Diana |last2=Papp |first2=Kathryn |title=Book Review Perspectives: The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy |date=March 18, 2009 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529111127/http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal|last=York |first=Richard |title=Ecological paradoxes: William Stanley Jevons and the paperless office |journal=Human Ecology Review |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=143–147 |url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her132/york.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, governments and [[environmentalist]]s generally assume that efficiency gains will lower [[resource consumption]], ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.&lt;ref name=Alcott1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.020|last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=Jevons' paradox |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=9–21 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905001084 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effects]] from improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates [[economic growth]], further increasing the demand for resources.  The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]]. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue [[sustainability]] by increasing energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt; Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wackernagel |first=Mathis |first2=William |last2=Rees |year=1997 |title=Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: Economics from an ecological footprint perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as [[cap and trade]] or [[green taxes]]) can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freire-González|first1=Jaume|last2=Puig-Ventosa|first2=Ignasi|title=Energy Efficiency Policies and the Jevons Paradox |journal=International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy |date=2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=69–79 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eco/journ2/2015-01-06.html |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|alt=Engraving of William Stanley Jevons|[[William Stanley Jevons]], after whom the paradox is named]]

The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]''. Jevons observed that [[England]]'s consumption of [[coal]] soared after [[James Watt]] introduced the [[Watt steam engine]], which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] from [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;

At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, [[water use|water usage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumont|first1=A.|last2=Mayor|first2=B.|last3=López-Gunn|first3=E.|title=Is the Rebound Effect or Jevons Paradox a Useful Concept for Better Management of Water Resources?

It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"/&gt;

Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for fuel.&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small |first= Kenneth A. |author2=Kurt Van Dender |title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966–2001 |journal=Policy and Economics | publisher=University of California Energy Institute, UC Berkeley | date = 2005-09-21 |volume= |series= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1h6141nj |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the [[cost]] of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a [[Goods and services|good or service]] will increase the quantity demanded (the [[law of demand]]). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]], and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the [[price elasticity of demand]] for the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Nathan W.|last2=Gillingham|first2=Kenneth|title=The Microeconomic Theory of the Rebound Effect and Its Welfare Implications|journal=Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists|date=1 March 2015|volume=2|issue=1|pages=133–159|doi=10.1086/680256|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680256|accessdate=4 February 2018|issn=2333-5955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is [[price elastic]]), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

==Khazzoom–Brookes postulate==
{{Main|Khazzoom–Brookes postulate}}

In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's [[World energy consumption|energy use]]. Brookes, then chief economist at the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the [[California Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D.|title=The Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth|journal=The Energy Journal|date=October 1992|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–148|jstor=41322471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|date=19 July 1999|title=Does energy efficiency save energy? The debate and its consequences|journal=Applied Energy|volume=63|issue=3|pages=209–226|issn=0306-2619|doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the ''Khazzoom–Brookes postulate'', and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical [[Economic growth|growth theory]] (the mainstream economic theory of [[capital accumulation]], [[Technological change|technological progress]] and [[long-run]] economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the [[neoclassical growth model]] under a wide range of assumptions.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrell|first1=Steve|title=Jevons’ Paradox revisited: The evidence for backfire from improved energy efficiency|journal=Energy Policy|date=April 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1456–1469|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.12.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007428|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saunders, increased [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5 | surname=Greening| first=Lorna | title=Energy efficiency and consumption—the rebound effect—a survey |author2=David L. Greene |author3=Carmen Difiglio| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=389–401 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issue=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

==Energy conservation policy==
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
{{Sustainable energy}}

There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]] policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many [[environmental economists]], doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards [[sustainability]], and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_owen|title=Annals of Environmentalism: The Efficiency Dilemma|last=Owen|first=David|date=December 20, 2010|work=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons Paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Kotchen |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Rapson |first3=David S. |last4=Wagner |first4=Gernot |title=Energy policy: The rebound effect is overplayed |journal=Nature |date=23 January 2013 |volume=493 |issue=7433 |pages=475–476 |doi=10.1038/493475a |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/493475a |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=En |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|last2=Campbell|first2=Nina|title=Spreading the net: the multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements|journal=IEA Energy Papers|doi=10.1787/20792581|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/spreading-the-net-the-multiple-benefits-of-energy-efficiency-improvements_5k9crzjbpkkc-en|accessdate=5 June 2015|series=IEA Energy Papers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that [[energy conservation]] efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of [[peak oil]]. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Potter | first=Andrew | title=Planet-friendly design?

First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant.&lt;ref name="Small"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi= 10.1002/aic.10747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a [[fuel tax]]) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt;

The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that [[sustainable energy]] policy must rely on other types of government interventions.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amado|first1=Nilton Bispo|last2=Sauer|first2=Ildo L.|title=An ecological economic interpretation of the Jevons effect|journal=Ecological Complexity|date=February 2012|volume=9|pages=2–9|doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2011.10.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X11000717|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt; To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. [[ecotax|green taxes]], [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]], or higher [[emissions standard]]s). The [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt; By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.&lt;ref name="Laitner DeCanio Peters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laitner |first=John A.|first2=Stephen J.|last2= De Canio |first3= Irene|last3= Peters |title=Incorporating Behavioural, Social, and Organizational Phenomena in the Assessment of Climate Change Mitigation Options  |journal=Society, Behaviour, and Climate Change Mitigation |year=2003|volume=8 |pages=1–64|doi=10.1007/0-306-48160-X_1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n107734r313hh4wp/ |accessdate=2010-08-08|series=Advances in Global Change Research|isbn=0-7923-6802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Smiling boy from Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|[[Laughter]], like that of these [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] children, is a typical expression of joy.]]
The word '''joy''' means a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/joy|title=Joy - Definition of joy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[C. S. Lewis]] saw clear distinction between joy, [[pleasure]], and [[happiness]]: "I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy."&lt;ref&gt;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. (p. 169) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;, and "I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is."&lt;ref&gt;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. (p. 18) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources. “When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.” [[Gautama Buddha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7437139-when-the-mind-is-pure-joy-follows-like-a-shadow|title=A quote by Gautama Buddha|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Joy is] the emotional dimension of the good life, of a life that is both going well and is being lived well."[[Miroslav Volf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volf|first1=Miroslav|title=Joy and Human Flourishing |date=Spring 2016|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|isbn=978-1-4514-8207-2|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."

The '''Key Largo woodrat''' (''Neotoma floridana smalli''),&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbour/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCleery-Midland/&gt; a [[subspecies]] of the [[eastern woodrat]] (''Neotoma floridana''), is a medium-sized [[rat]] found in the northern area of [[Key Largo, Florida]], in the [[United States]]. It is currently on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species]]. The rat grows to 260 grams and feeds on [[fruit]], [[leaf|leaves]] and buds. It has a gray-brown back and white belly, chest, and throat, and a hairy tail. Only 6500 animals were thought to remain in North Key Largo in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Although a 1923 article described woodrat nests on Key Largo, the form was not scientifically described until 1955, when H.B. Sherman described it as ''Neotoma floridana smalli'', a [[subspecies]] of the widespread [[eastern woodrat]] (''Neotoma floridana'').&lt;!--can't find any reference in the paper to etymology--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sherman, H.B.|date=1955|title=Description of a new race of woodrat from Key Largo, Florida|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=36|issue=1|pages=113–120|jstor=1375731|doi=10.2307/1375731}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Lazell suggested that it is distinct enough to be considered a separate species, but this proposal has not been accepted.&lt;!--p.333--&gt; The [[mitochondrial DNA]] of Key Largo woodrats is distinct by at least 0.6% from that of the most similar subspecies, the Florida woodrat (''Neotoma floridana floridana'') from further north in Florida, but members of that subspecies differ about as much from each other as from the Key Largo woodrat.&lt;!--p.340--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;

==Description==
The Key Largo woodrat is similar to the Florida woodrat (''Neotoma floridana floridana'') and cannot be distinguished from it in size or external anatomy. It differs in the shape of the [[sphenopalatine vacuities]] (openings in the roof of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the gap behind the [[palate]]), which are narrower and shorter than in ''N.&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;floridana''. On average, males are a bit larger than females. In the [[holotype]], an adult male, total length is {{convert|368|mm|in|abbr=on}}, tail length {{convert|167|mm|in|abbr=on}}, hindfoot length {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}, ear length {{convert|26|mm|in|abbr=on}}, dimensions of the [[testis]] {{convert|14|x|8.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and mass is {{convert|207|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;!--Sherman doesn't give measurements for other specimens; leaving this in until I find something better--&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The animal is found exclusively in the northern part of Key Largo, at least 210&amp;nbsp;km removed from its nearest kin, the [[Florida woodrat]]. It is endemic to the [[tropical hardwood hammock]]s of Key Largo, where its habitat has shrunk by half since the 1920s, and the remainder is fragmented, thinned, and developed. It retains some 850 [[Hectare|ha]], most of which is in the [[Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park]] and the adjacent [[Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt;

===Shelter===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Finished Structure for Key Largo Woodrat Home.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Man-made structure for Key Largo woodrat, in [[Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].]] --&gt;
The Key Largo woodrat builds nests out of sticks; these nests can be as high as a man's shoulder. They are handed down from generation to generation, and some are possibly centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HQEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5NEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2738,3199387&amp;dq=key-largo-woodrat&amp;hl=en|title=Wildlife Officer Works to Save Endangered Rat|date=20 April 1989|publisher=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|page=13|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Since the Key Largo woodrat has a small and specific habitat, it is susceptible to human encroachment. Since the 1920s, it has lost almost half of its traditional habitat.&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt; In the early 1980s, biologists began equipping rats with radio devices to count them and study them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB35F123848B241&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Federal Aid Sought as the Woodrat's Time Runs Out|date=21 March 1984|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=1D|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the 1980s, a study showed that the rat had disappeared from Key Largo proper and its total population had dwindled to some 6500 animals on [[North Key Largo]].&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt; Its fate in Key Largo was tied to that of the [[American Crocodile]], and when a planned reservation for the crocodile in North Key Largo bogged down during the presidential transition in the US Administration in 1980, the woodrat was threatened with extinction; the crocodile reservation was to be a haven for the woodrat, and also for the rare [[Papilio aristodemus|Schaus Swallowtail]] butterfly. A project called Port Bougainville, with 15 hotels besides condos, would add 45,000 inhabitants to North Key Largo by the year 2000, adding to the pressure on the crocodile and other animals.&lt;ref name="condo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z9ohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qp8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1569,1661650&amp;dq=key-largo-woodrat&amp;hl=en|title=Condos May Kill Off American Crocodiles: It's the 11th Hour for the American Crocodile and other Endangered Species that Live on Key Largo|last=Dahlburg|first=John-Thor|date=18 December 1982|publisher=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]]|pages=19A|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">{{ about|the secret script invented by Lao rebels|the Ancient Khmer script called "khom" in Thai, used for Buddhist manuscripts and yantras|Khmer alphabet }}

There are two scripts in Southeast Asia called '''Khom script'''.  This article describes the obscure script from [[Laos]] that Sidwell (2008) and Jacq (2001) have described under the name "Khom script". 
[[File:Khom script.png|thumb|Samples of symbols from the Khom script, showing how it creates syllables]]

This ''Khom'' script is unique in the way it divides syllables.  It has one set of symbols to represent initial consonants.  Then it uses another set of symbols to represent the final vowel and consonant.  That is, unlike a [[syllabary]] (which has unitary symbols for consonants followed by vowels (CV), with maybe a vowelless consonant following), Khom script divides the syllable as C-VC, rather than CV-C (Sidwell 2008). This is unique, not readily accommodated in any of the existing typologies of scripts. 

The script was invented by [[Ong Kommandam|Ong Kommadam]], a leader in the rebellion against the French colonizers.  He began using the script as early as 1924, but its use did not continue after his death in 1936.  Ong Kommadam claimed supernatural titles, including “King of the Khom”, “God of the Khom”, “Sky God of the Khom” (Sidwell 2008:17). The script was linked to his divine claims, messages written in this script carried mystical power as well as meaning.

The script was revealed to outsiders by old, dying insiders on two separate occasions (Sidwell 2008).  Some of the symbols resemble those from nearby scripts, but many are original. The script contains more than 300 characters, in order to fully encompass the rich morphology of the [[Bahnaric languages]].

The term "Khom" is also used to refer to the Ancient Khmer lettering used in Thailand's Buddhist temples to inscribe sacred Buddhist mantras and prayers, but that is an entirely different script.

The script could be used to write various [[Bahnaric languages]], including the [[Laven language|Laven dialects]], especially [[Jru' language|Jru']], and languages like [[Alak language|Alak]], Ong Kommadam's native language.

'''Mahatma''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|t|m|ə|,_|-|ˈ|h|æ|t|-}}) is [[Sanskrit]] for "Great Soul"  (महात्मा ''mahātmā'': महा ''mahā'' (great) + आत्मं or आत्मन ''ātman'' [soul]).  It is similar in usage to the modern English term [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Mahātma |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[epithet]] is commonly applied to prominent people like [[Basava|Basaveshwara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/speech-details.php?nodeid=333|title=PM's address on the occasion of release of Commemorative Coin in honour of Mahatma Basaveshwara :

It has also been historically used for a class of Jain scholars.

==Mohandas Gandhi's title "Mahatma"==
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}
According to  [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have used on March 6, 1915, this title for Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that he was called Mahatma by the residents of Gurukul Kangadi in April 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inextlive.jagran.com/mahatma-gandhi-201210010040 और इस तरह गांधी महात्मा बन गए, 01-Oct-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and he in turn called the founder Munshiram a Mahatma (who later became [[Swami Shraddhananda]]). However, a document honoring him with the title "Mahatma" on Jan 21, 1915, in [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]], Gujarat, by [[Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta|Nautamlal Bhagvanji Mehta]] is preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gandhimuseum.org/site/sections/photo-section/ National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi]; [http://www.kamdartree.com/index.php?id=57&amp;stitle=Mahatma%20&amp;%20Kamdars KamdarTree.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This document remains the earliest record of the title "Mahatma" being bestowed upon Gandhi. The use of the term Mahatma in [[Jainism]] to denote a class of lay priests, has been noted since the 17th century. A Mahatma is someone who practices [[Trikaranasuddhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sankar R N|first1=Ajith|title=Ascertaining Linkages between Trikaranasuddhi and ‘Tapping Spirituality as the Context of Leadership’|journal=IPE Journal of Management|date=Jul–Dec 2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–105|ssrn=2212138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Theosophy}} Theosophy&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Order of the Star in the East]] --&gt;==
The word, used in a technical sense, was popularized in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature in the late 19th century, when Madame [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], claimed that her teachers were [[adept]]s (or Mahatmas) who reside in [[Asia]].

According to the Theosophical teachings, the Mahatmas are not disembodied beings, but highly evolved people involved in overseeing the spiritual growth of individuals and the development of civilizations. Blavatsky was the first person in modern times to claim contact with these Adepts, especially the "Masters" [[Koot Hoomi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]. [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote about mahātmās:&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn (1930), – p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Masters whom Theosophy presents to us are simply high-ranking students in life's school of experience. They are members of our own evolutionary group, not visitants from the celestial spheres. They are supermen only in that they have attained knowledge of the laws of life and mastery over its forces with which we are still struggling.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September and October 1880, Blavatsky visited [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]] at [[Shimla|Simla]] in northern India. Sinnett wrote ''[[The Occult World]]'' (1881) and [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

There has been a great deal of controversy concerning the existence of adepts. Blavatsky's critics have doubted the existence of her Masters.  See, for example, W. E. Coleman's "exposes".

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, numerous individuals have claimed to be in contact with her Adept Teachers. These individuals have stated that they are new "messengers" of the Masters and they have conveyed various esoteric teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blavatskyarchives.com/latermessengers.htm Madame Blavatsky &amp; the Latter-Day Messengers of the Masters].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, various [[New Age]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and religious organizations refer to them as [[Ascended Master]]s, although their character and teachings are in several respects different from those described by Theosophical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals{{who|date=August 2017}} believe that Mahatma Maitreya (also called World Teacher) will make contact with all Humanity in January 2017.

==Divine Light Mission==
The [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM) was a [[Contemporary Sant Mat movements|Sant Mat]]-based movement begun in India in the 1930s by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and formally incorporated in 1960. The DLM had as many as 2,000 Mahatmas, all from India or Tibet, who taught the DLM's secret meditation techniques called "Knowledge".  The Mahatmas, called "realised souls",&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"&gt;Price, Maeve (1979): The Divine Light Mission as a social organization. (1) Sociological Review, 27, Page 279-296&lt;/ref&gt; or "apostles",  also served as local leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul V. Levine|Levine, Saul V.]] in {{cite book |author=Galanter, Marc |title=Cults and New Religious Movements: A Report of the American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-212-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hans Ji's death in 1966 his youngest son,  [[Prem Rawat]] (known then as Guru Maharaj Ji or Bagyogeshwar), succeeded him. The young guru appointed some new Mahatmas, including one from the United States.  In one incident, a prominent Indian Mahatma nearly beat a man to death in Detroit for throwing a pie at the guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Who in Gurus|first=Dennis |last=Bartel|page= 55|work=Harper's|date=November 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Prem Rawat replaced the Divine Light Mission organization with the Elan Vital and replaced the Mahatmas with initiators. The initiators did not have the revered status of the Mahatmas, and they were drawn mostly from Western followers.&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"/&gt; In the 2000s, the initiators were replaced by a video in which Rawat teaches the techniques himself.

==In popular culture==
[[W. C. Fields#At Paramount|W.C. Fields]] used the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves when writing the script for ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940), in a play on both the word "Mahatma" and a phrase an aristocrat might use when addressing a servant, before leaving the house: "My hat, my cane, Jeeves".

Among the [[Jain]]s the term  Mahatma is used for class for scholars who are householders.

===Mahatma Hirananda of Mewad===

===Jain Mahatmas in the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]===
The famous [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]] often attributed to one Mohsin Fani, written around 1655 CE. is a text written in the Mughal period that describes various religions and philosophies the author encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxJgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=THE+DABIST%C3%81N,+OR+SCHOOL+OF+MANNERS&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=THE%20DABIST%C3%81N%2C%20OR%20SCHOOL%20OF%20MANNERS&amp;f=false  The Dabistán: Or, School of Manners: The Religious Beliefs, Observances, Philosophic Opinions and Social Customs of the Nations of the East, Fani Muhsin, Translated by David Shea, Anthony Troyer, Publisher, M. Walter Dunne, 1901 p. 275-276]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Section 11 is dedicated to Jainism. It states: "Similar to the durvishes of both classes (Srivaras and [[Yati|Jatis]]) is a third sect, called Mahá-átma; they have the dress and appearance of Jatis; only they do not pluck their hair with tweezers, but cut it. They accumulate money, cook their meal in their houses, drink cold water, and take to them a wife." The term Mahatma was thus used for priest/scholars who were not celibate. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], 'Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'.

==Criticism==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] in his books&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1994), Johnson (1995) – p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that the "Masters" that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s. Aryel Sanat,&lt;ref&gt;"Aryel Sanat (Miguel Angel Sanabria) is currently Adjunct Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the American University in Washington, D.C." // [https://books.google.ru/books?id=0dHP2f_6k4YC&amp;dq=editions:jYIKHxJulMgC&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s About author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti'' in 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti: private passion and perennial wisdom'', wrote that Johnson "claims in all of his books that there were no Masters at all in early [[Theosophical Society|[Theosophical Society]]] history, &amp; that [[Helena Blavatsky|[Helena Blavatsky]]] '''invented''' them (as others had claimed she had invented her travels)." Sanat wrote that Johnson "'''deliberately''' ignores the main sources of evidence for their real physical existence."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theos-talk.com/archives/200005/tt00087.html ''Theosophy World.'']&lt;/ref&gt; What Sanat thought these were is not made quite clear.

The '''mass-to-charge ratio''' (''m''/''Q'') is a [[physical quantity]] that is most widely used in the [[electrodynamics]] of charged particles, e.g. in electron optics and [[ion optics]].  It appears in the scientific fields of [[electron microscopy]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[accelerator physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[Auger electron spectroscopy]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="M03752"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=mass-to-charge ratio, m/z in mass spectrometry|file=M03752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of the mass-to-charge ratio, according to classical electrodynamics, is that two particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path in a vacuum , when subjected to the same electric and magnetic fields. Its SI units are [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Coulomb|C]]. In rare occasions the [[Thomson (unit)|thomson]] has been used as its unit in the field of mass spectrometry.

Some fields use the '''charge-to-mass''' ratio (''Q''/''m'') instead, which is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of the mass-to-charge ratio.  The 2014 CODATA recommended value for an [[electron]] is {{frac|''Q''|''m''}} = {{val|-1.758820024|(11)|e=11|u=C/kg}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?esme electron charge to mass quotient]. NIST Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

When charged particles move in electric and magnetic fields the following two laws apply:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = Q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|([[Lorentz force]] law)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a} = m \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|([[Newton's second law]] of motion)
|}

where '''F''' is the [[force]] applied to the ion, ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the particle, '''a''' is the [[acceleration]], ''Q'' is the [[electric charge]], '''E''' is the [[electric field]], and '''v''' &amp;times; '''B''' is the [[cross product]] of the ion's [[velocity]] and the [[magnetic flux density]].

This differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of ''m''/''Q''. Thus [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] could be thought of as "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When presenting data in a [[mass spectrum]], it is common to use the dimensionless ''m''/''z'', which denotes the dimensionless quantity formed by dividing the mass number of the ion by its charge number.&lt;ref name="M03752" /&gt;

Combining the two previous equations yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{m}{Q}\right)\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

This differential equation is the classic equation of motion of a charged particle in vacuum. Together with the particle's initial conditions it determines the particle's motion in space and time.  It immediately reveals that two particles with the same ''m''/''Q'' ratio behave in the same way. This is why the mass-to-charge ratio is an important physical quantity in those scientific fields where charged particles interact with magnetic or electric fields.

=== Exceptions ===

There are non-classical effects that derive from [[quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment|Stern–Gerlach effect]] that can diverge the path of ions of identical ''m''/''Q''.

== Symbols and units ==
The IUPAC recommended symbol for mass and charge are ''m'' and ''Q'', respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; however using a lowercase ''q'' for charge is also very common. Charge is a scalar property, meaning that it can be either [[positive number|positive]] (+) or [[negative number|negative]] (&amp;minus;). The [[Coulomb]] (C) is the SI unit of charge; however, other units can be used, such as expressing charge in terms of the [[elementary charge]] (e). The [[SI unit]] of the physical quantity ''m''/''Q'' is kilogram per coulomb.

===Mass spectrometry and ''m''/''z''===
{{main|Mass spectrum}}
The units and notation above are used when dealing with the physics of mass spectrometry; however, the ''m''/''z'' notation is used for the independent variable in a [[mass spectrum]].&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite book | title=IUPAC.

An example might help.|date=July 2018}} data interpretation since it is numerically more related to the [[unified atomic mass unit]].&lt;ref name="M03752" /&gt; The ''m'' refers to the molecular or atomic mass number and ''z'' to the [[charge number]] of the [[ion]]; however, the quantity of ''m''/''z'' is dimensionless by definition.&lt;ref name="IUPAC" /&gt; An ion of 100 atomic mass units (''m'' = 100) carrying two charges (''z'' = 2) will be observed at ''m''/''z'' = 50.

== History ==
In the 19th century, the mass-to-charge ratios of some ions were measured by electrochemical methods. In 1897, the mass-to-charge ratio of the [[electron]] was first measured by [[J. J. Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/thomson1897.html J. J. Thomson (1856–1940)] Philosophical Magazine, 44, 293 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, he showed that the electron was in fact a particle with a mass and a charge, and that its mass-to-charge ratio was much smaller than that of the hydrogen ion H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1898, [[Wilhelm Wien]] separated ions ([[canal ray]]s) according to their mass-to-charge ratio with an ion optical device with superimposed electric and magnetic fields ([[Wien filter]]). In 1901 [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufman]] measured the increase of [[electromagnetic mass]] of fast electrons ([[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]), or [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] increase in modern terms. In 1913, Thomson measured the mass-to-charge ratio of [[ion]]s with an instrument he called a parabola spectrograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html Joseph John Thomson (1856–1940)] Proceedings of the Royal Society A 89, 1–20 (1913) [as excerpted in Henry A. Boorse &amp; Lloyd Motz, The World of the Atom, Vol. 1 (New York: Basic Books, 1966)]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, an instrument that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles is called a [[mass spectrometer]].

==Charge-to-mass ratio==

[[File:Mass spectrometer large print.svg|thumb|160px|'''B''' is uniform throughout; '''E''' exists only where shown.]]
The '''charge-to-mass ratio''' (''Q''/''m'') of an object is, as its name implies, the [[electric charge|charge]] of an object divided by the mass of the same object.  This quantity is generally useful only for objects that may be treated as particles.  For extended objects, total charge, charge density, total mass, and mass density are often more useful.

Derivation:

&lt;math&gt;qvB=mv\frac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{Br}&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Since &lt;math&gt;F_{electric}=F_{magnetic}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;Eq=Bqv&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v=\frac{E}{B}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Equations (1) and (2) yield

&lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{m}=\frac{E}{B^2r}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Significance ===
In some experiments, the charge-to-mass ratio is the only quantity that can be measured directly.  Often, the charge can be inferred from theoretical considerations, so that the charge-to-mass ratio provides a way to calculate the mass of a particle.

Often, the charge-to-mass ratio can be determined from observing the deflection of a charged particle in an external [[magnetic]] field.  The [[cyclotron]] equation, combined with other information such as the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle, will give the charge-to-mass ratio. One application of this principle is the mass spectrometer.  The same principle can be used to extract information in experiments involving the [[cloud chamber]].

The ratio of electrostatic to gravitational forces between two particles will be proportional to the product of their charge-to-mass ratios.  It turns out that gravitational forces are negligible on the subatomic level, due to the extremely small masses of subatomic particles.

=== The electron ===

The elementary charge-to-electron mass quotient, &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt;, is a quantity in experimental physics.  It bears significance because the electron mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to measure directly, and is instead derived from measurements of the elementary charge e and &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt;.  It also has historical significance; the ''Q''/''m'' ratio of the electron was successfully calculated by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897—and more successfully by Dunnington, which involves the [[angular momentum]] and deflection due to a perpendicular [[magnetic field]]. Thomson's measurement convinced him that [[cathode ray]]s were particles, which were later identified as [[electron]]s, and he is generally credited with their discovery.

The 2014 [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology|CODATA]] recommended value is &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|fmt=commas|-1.758820024|(11)|e=11|u=[[Coulomb|C]]/[[kilogram|kg]]}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; CODATA refers to this as the '''electron charge-to-mass quotient''', but '''ratio''' is still commonly used.

There are two other common ways of measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron, apart from Thomson and Dunnington's methods.

#The magnetron method: Using a GRD7 Valve ([[Ferranti valve]]),{{dubious|date=November 2010}} electrons are expelled from a hot tungsten-wire filament towards an anode. The electron is then deflected using a solenoid. From the current in the solenoid and the current in the Ferranti Valve, e/m can be calculated.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
#Fine beam tube method: A heater heats a cathode, which emits electrons.  The electrons are accelerated through a known potential, so the velocity of the electrons is known.  The beam path can be seen when the electrons are accelerated through a helium (He) gas.  The collisions between the electrons and the helium gas produce a visible trail.  A pair of [[Helmholtz coil]]s produces a uniform and measurable magnetic field at right angles to the electron beam.  This magnetic field deflects the electron beam in a circular path.  By measuring the accelerating potential (volts), the current (amps) to the Helmholtz coils, and the radius of the electron beam, e/m can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;PASCO scientific, Instruction Manual and Experimental guide for the PASCO scientific Model SE-9638, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeeman Effect===
The charge-to-mass ratio of an electron may also be measured with the [[Zeeman effect]], which gives rise to energy splittings in the presence of a [[magnetic field]] ''B'':
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m}(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i})&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are quantum integer values ranging from -''j'' to ''j'', with ''j'' as the [[eigenvalue]] of the [[total angular momentum]] [[operator (physics)|operator]] '''J''', with&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''S''' is the [[Spin (physics)|spin operator]] with eigenvalue ''s'' and '''L''' is  the [[angular momentum operator]] with eigenvalue ''l''. ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Landé g-factor]], calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;g_J = 1 + \frac{j(j+1) + s(s+1) - l(l+1)}{2j(j+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The shift in energy is also given in terms of [[frequency]] ''&amp;nu;'' and [[wavelength]] ''&amp;lambda;'' as

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = h\Delta\nu = h c \Delta \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right ) = hc \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Measurements of the Zeeman effect commonly involve the use of a [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]], with light from a source (placed in a magnetic field) being passed between two mirrors of the interferometer. If ''&amp;delta;D'' is the change in mirror separation required to bring the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order ring of wavelength ''λ'' + ''Δλ'' into coincidence with that of wavelength ''λ'', and ''ΔD'' brings the (''m'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ring of wavelength ''λ'' into coincidence with the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order ring, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda = \lambda^2\frac{\delta D}{2D\Delta D}&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows then that

:&lt;math&gt;hc\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda^2} = hc\frac{\delta D}{2D\Delta D} = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m}(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i}) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, it is possible to solve for the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{m} = \frac{4 \pi c}{B(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i})}\frac{\delta D}{D\Delta D} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Material take off''' ('''MTO''') is a term used in [[engineering]] and [[construction]], and refers to a list of [[Raw material|material]]s with quantities and types (such as specific grades of [[steel]]) that are required to build a designed structure or item. This list is generated by analysis of a [[blueprint]] or other design document. The list of required materials for construction is sometimes referred to as the material take off list (MTOL).

Material take off is not limited to the amount of required material, but also the weight of the items taken off. This is important when dealing with larger structures, allowing the company that does the take off to determine total weight of the item and how best to move the item (if necessary) when construction is completed.

==Definition used by the ISA (International Society of Automation)==
A material take off (MTO) is the process of analyzing the drawings and determining all the materials required to accomplish the design. We then use the material take off to create a [[bill of materials]] (BOM). Inspection does not aid in creating a bill of materials. Procurement and requisition are activities that occur after the bill of materials is complete.

In law, the terms '''moot''' and '''mootness''' have different meanings in [[British English]] and [[American English]].

In the [[Law of the United States|legal system of the United States]], a matter is '''moot''' if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.  Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic. The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of [[moot court]]s, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education.  These purely academic issues led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as "moot".  The doctrine can be compared to the [[ripeness]] doctrine, another judge-made rule, that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts.  Similar doctrines prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=matthew_hall |last1=Hall |first1=Mathew I |title=The Partially Prudential Doctrine of Mootness |volume=77 |work=George Washington Law Review |page=562 |date=August 2008 |publisher=[[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[McGeorge School of Law]] |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different from the usage in the [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal system]], where the term "moot" has the meaning of "debatable". The shift in usage was first observed in the [[United States]].

==U.S. federal courts==
In the U.S. federal judicial system, a moot case must be dismissed, there being a constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The reason for this is that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] limits the jurisdiction of all federal courts to "[[cases and controversies]]". Thus, a civil action or appeal in which the court's decision will not affect the rights of the parties is ordinarily beyond the power of the court to decide, provided it does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.

A textbook example of such a case is the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}.  The plaintiff was a student who had been denied admission to [[law school]], and had then been provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case. Because the student was slated to graduate within a few months at the time the decision was rendered, and there was no action the law school could take to prevent that, the Court determined that a decision on its part would have no effect on the student's rights. Therefore, the case was dismissed as moot.

However, there is disagreement as to both the source of the standards, and their application in the courts.  Some courts and observers opine that cases ''must'' be dismissed because this is a constitutional bar, and there is no "case or controversy"; others have rejected the pure constitutional approach and adopted a so-called "prudential" view, where dismissal ''may'' depend upon a host of factors, whether the particular person has lost a viable interest in the case, or whether the issue itself survives outside the interests of the particular person, whether the circumstance are likely to recur, etc.  In actual practice, the U.S. federal courts have been uneven in their decisions, which has led to the accusation that determinations are ''[[ad hoc]]'' and 'result-oriented.'&lt;ref&gt;Hall, supra.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major exceptions to this mootness rule. These are cases of "voluntary cessation" on the part of the [[defendant]]; questions that involve secondary or collateral legal consequences; questions that are "capable of ''repetition,'' yet evading review"; and questions involving [[class action]]s where the named party ceases to represent the class.

===Voluntary cessation===
Where a defendant is acting wrongfully, but ceases to engage in such conduct once a [[litigation]] has been threatened or commenced, the court will still not deem this correction to moot the case. Obviously, a party could stop acting improperly just long enough for the case to be dismissed and then resume the improper conduct. For example, in ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|528|167|2000}}, the Supreme Court held that an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued, could not claim that the case was moot, even though the polluter had ceased polluting and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution. The court noted that so long as the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, it could open similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the penalties sought.

Another example occurs when a court dismisses as "moot" a legal challenge to an existing law, where the law being challenged is either amended or repealed through legislation before the court case could be settled.  A recent instance of this occurred in ''[[Moore v. Madigan]],'' when Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to appeal a ruling of the Seventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals striking down Illinois handgun carry ban to the [[United States Supreme Court]], as Illinois subsequently passed a law legalizing concealed carry with a state-issued license, which rendered the case moot.

===Secondary or collateral legal consequences===
"The obvious fact of life is that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences. The mere possibility that this will be the case is enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ignominiously in the limbo of mootness." Sibron v. New York.

===Capable of repetition, yet evading review===
A court will allow a case to go forward if it is the type for which persons will frequently be faced with a particular situation, but will likely cease to be in a position where the court can provide a remedy for them in the time that it takes for the justice system to address their situation. The most frequently cited example is the 1973 United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, which challenged a [[Texas]] law forbidding [[abortion]] in most circumstances. The state argued that the case was moot because plaintiff [[Norma McCorvey|Roe]] was no longer pregnant by the time the case was heard.  As [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] wrote in the majority opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norma McCorvey, whose alias was Roe, became a [[pro-life]] advocate and attempted to have the decision of ''Roe v. Wade'' reversed and in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'', 2004, the case failed to proceed based on being moot, without [[standing (law)|standing]] and out of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of limitations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court cited ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]'', {{ussc|219|498|1911}}, which had held that a case was not moot when it presented an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review". Perhaps in response to increasing workloads at all levels of the judiciary, the recent trend in the Supreme Court and other U.S. courts has been to construe this exception rather narrowly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Many cases fall under the "capable of repetition" doctrine; however, because there is a review process available under most circumstances, the exception to declaring mootness did not apply to such cases.  In ''Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft'', 436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978), the court noted that claims for [[damages]] save cases from mootness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-351.pdf |title=Slip: ''Alvarez v. Smith'' (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class action representatives===
Where a class action lawsuit is brought, with one named plaintiff actually representing the interests of many others, the case will not become moot even if the named plaintiff ceases to belong to the class that is seeking a remedy. In ''[[Sosna v. Iowa]]'', {{ussc|419|393|1975}}, the plaintiff represented a class that was challenging an [[Iowa]] law that required persons to reside there for a year before seeking a [[divorce]] in Iowa's courts. The Supreme Court held that, although the plaintiff successfully divorced in another state, her [[Lawyer|attorneys]] could continue to competently advance the interests of other members of the class.

==U.S. state courts==
The [[U.S. state]] courts are not subject to the Article III limitations on their jurisdiction, and some state courts are permitted by their local constitutions and laws to render opinions in moot cases where the establishment of a legal precedent is desirable.  They may also establish exceptions to the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaiiopinions.blogspot.com/2008/10/prejudice-pushes-aside-mootness.html Prejudice Pushes Aside Mootness Doctrine Hamilton v. Lethem] (HSC October 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in some state courts the prosecution can lodge an appeal after a defendant is acquitted: although the appellate court cannot set aside a not-guilty verdict due to [[double jeopardy]], it can issue a ruling as to whether a trial court's ruling on a particular issue during the trial was erroneous. This opinion will then be binding on future cases heard by the courts of that state.

Some U.S. states also accept [[certified question]]s from the federal courts or the courts of other states. Under these procedures, state courts can issue opinions, usually for the purpose of clarifying or updating state law, in cases not actually pending in those courts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure, Title XI, Rule 64, "Certified Questions of State Law From Federal Courts".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the U.S.==
Although free from the U.S. Constitutional limitation, Canada has recognized that considerations of judicial economy and [[comity]] with the legislative and executive branch may justify a decision to dismiss an allegedly moot case, as deciding hypothetical controversies is tantamount to legislating.  Considerations of the effectiveness of advocacy involved in the adversarial system and the possibility of recurrence of an alleged constitutional violation may sway the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&amp;pg=PA286 Morton, Frederick Lee, (March 2002) ''Law, politics, and the judicial process in Canada'' (BPR Publishers) 660pp.] {{ISBN|978-1-55238-046-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial governments can ask for advisory opinions in hypothetical scenarios, termed [[reference question]]s, from their respective highest courts.

==Moot point==
The phrase '''[[wikt:moot point|moot point]]''' refers (in American English) to an issue that is irrelevant to a subject being discussed or, in British English, one that is debatable. Due to the relatively uncommon usage of the word moot, and because "moot" and "mute" are [[homophone]]s in some pronunciations, this is sometimes erroneously rendered as "mute point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/mute.html Mute Point/Moot Point], from Paul Brians, ''Common Errors in English Usage'' (3rd Edition), William, James Co. November, 2013 (retrieved April 16 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==General introduction==
Multimodal perception is a scientific term that describes how humans form coherent, valid, and robust perception by [[sensory processing|processing sensory]] stimuli from various modalities.  Surrounded by multiple objects and receiving multiple sensory stimulations, the brain is faced with the decision of how to categorize the stimuli resulting from different objects or events in the physical world.  The nervous system is thus responsible for whether to integrate or segregate certain groups of temporally coincident sensory signals based on the degree of spatial and structural congruence of those stimulations.  Multimodal perception has been widely studied in cognitive science, behavioral science, and neuroscience.

===Stimuli and sensory modalities===
There are four attributes of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The [[neocortex]] in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary visual area, V1, or primary [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus features such as brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections to each other as well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well.&lt;ref name="Lemus 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemus L, Hernández A, Luna R, Zainos A, Romo R |title=Do sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality during perceptual judgments? |journal=Neuron |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=335–48 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20670839 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.06.015 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binding problem===
{{main|Binding problem}}
The relationship between the binding problem and multisensory perception can be thought of as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]], chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the [[visual system|visual domain]] (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory [[perception]].&lt;ref name="Zmigrod 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zmigrod | first1 = S. | last2 = Hommel | first2 = B. | title = Temporal dynamics of unimodal and multimodal feature binding. | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–52 |date=Jan 2010 | doi = 10.3758/APP.72.1.142 | pmid = 20045885 |url = http://www.bernhard-hommel.eu/The%20temporal%20dynamics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, considerations of how unified conscious representations are formed are not the full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact in order to maximize how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of [[Gestalt psychology]] schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain,&lt;ref name="Wagemans 2012a"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Wagemans | first1 = J. | last2 = Elder | first2 = JH. | last3 = Kubovy | first3 = M. | last4 = Palmer | first4 = SE. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = MA. | last6 = Singh | first6 = M. | last7 = von der Heydt | first7 = R. | title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: I.

===History===
Studies of sensory processing in humans and other animals has traditionally been performed one sense at a time,&lt;ref name="Fodor 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fodor, Jerry A. |title=Modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1983 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-06084-4 |oclc=551957787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the present day, numerous academic societies and journals are largely restricted to considering sensory modalities separately ([[Vision science|'Vision Research']], [[Audiology|'Hearing Research']] etc.). 
However, there is also a long and parallel history of multisensory research. An example is the  [[George M. Stratton|Stratton's]] (1896) experiments on the somatosensory effects of wearing vision-distorting prism glasses.&lt;ref name="Stratton 1896"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stratton| first1=George M.| title=Some preliminary experiments on vision without inversion of the retinal image. |journal=Psychological Review| volume=3|issue=6| year=1896| pages=611–617 |doi=10.1037/h0072918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratton 1897"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stratton| first1=George M.| title=Vision without inversion of the retinal image. |journal=Psychological Review| volume=4| issue=4| year=1897| pages=341–360, 463–481 | doi = 10.1037/h0075482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multisensory interactions or [[crossmodal]] effects
in which the perception of a stimulus is influenced by
the presence of another type of stimulus are  referred since very
early in the past. They were reviewed by Hartmann&lt;ref name="Hartman1935"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hartmann| first1=G.M.| title=Gestalt Psychology | publisher = The Ronald Press | year = 1935 | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a fundamental book where, among several
references to different types of multisensory interactions,
reference is made to the work of Urbantschitsch in 1888&lt;ref name="Urbantschitsch1888"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Urbantschitsch| first1=V.| title=Über den Einfluss einer Sinneserregung auf die übrigen Sinnesempfindungen. |journal=Pflügers Archiv| volume=42| year=1888| pages=154–182| doi=10.1007/bf01669354}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported on the improvement of visual acuity by auditive stimuli in subjects

This effect was also found latter in normals by Krakov&lt;ref name="Kravkov1930"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kravkov| first1=S.V.| title=Über die Abhängigkeit der Sehschärfe vom Schallreiz. |journal=Arch.

other type of stimuli.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1933" /&gt;  It is also noteworthy the amount

Union, reviewed by London.&lt;ref name="London1954"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=London| first1=I.D.| title=Research of sensory interaction in the Soviet Union. |journal=Psychol.

In this syndrome,  all the sensory functions are affected, and with symmetric bilaterality, in spite of being a unilateral lesion where the primary areas were not involved. A feature of this syndrome is the great permeability to crossmodal effects between visual, tactile, auditive stimuli as well as muscular effort to improve the perception, also decreasing the reaction times. The improvement by crossmodal effect was found to be greater as
the primary stimulus to be perceived was weaker, and as the cortical lesion was greater (Vol I and II  of reference&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;). This author interpreted these phenomena under a dynamic physiological concept, and from a model based on functional gradients through the cortex and scaling laws of dynamical systems, thus highlighting the functional unity of the cortex. According to the functional cortical gradients,  the specificity of the cortex would be distributed in gradation, and the overlap of different specific gradients would be related to multisensory interactions.&lt;ref name=Gradients&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1952).

Multisensory research has recently gained enormous interest and popularity.

===Example of spatial congruent and structural congruent===
When we hear a [[vehicle horn|car honk]], we would determine which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, the sound and the pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.

==Theories and approaches==

===Visual dominance===
Literature on spatial [[crossmodal]] biases suggests that visual modality often influences information from other senses.&lt;ref name="Witten 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Witten | first1 = IB. | last2 = Knudsen | first2 = EI. | title = Why seeing is believing: merging auditory and visual worlds. | journal = Neuron | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–96 |date=Nov 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.020 | pmid = 16269365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that vision dominates what we hear, when varying the degree of spatial congruency. This is known as the ventriloquist effect.&lt;ref name="Shams 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Shams | first1 = L. | last2 = Beierholm | first2 = UR. | title = Causal inference in perception. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 425–32 |date=Sep 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.001 | pmid = 20705502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of visual and haptic integration, children younger than 8 years of age show visual dominance when required to identify object orientation. However, haptic dominance occurs when the factor to identify is object size.&lt;ref name="Gori 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gori | first1 = M. | last2 = Del Viva | first2 = M. | last3 = Sandini | first3 = G. | last4 = Burr | first4 = DC. | title = Young children do not integrate visual and haptic form information. | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | pages = 694–8 |date=May 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.036 | pmid = 18450446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gori 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gori | first1 = M. | last2 = Sandini | first2 = G. | last3 = Burr | first3 = D. | title = Development of visuo-auditory integration in space and time. | journal = Front Integr Neurosci | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 77 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2012.00077 | pmid = 23060759 | pmc = 3443931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality appropriateness===
According to Welch and Warren (1980), the Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis states that the influence of perception in each modality in multisensory integration depends on that modality's appropriateness for the given task. Thus, vision has a greater influence on integrated localization than hearing, and hearing and touch have a greater bearing on timing estimates than vision.&lt;ref name="Welch 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Welch RB, Warren DH |title=Immediate perceptual response to intersensory discrepancy |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=638–67 |date=November 1980 |pmid=7003641 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederman and Klatzky 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lederman|first1=Susan J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=Roberta L.|editor1-last=Calvert|editor1-first=Gemma A.|editor2-last=Spence|editor2-first=Charles|editor3-last=Stein|editor3-first=Barry E.|title=The Handbook of Multisensory Processing|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-03321-3|pages=107–122|chapter=Multisensory Texture Perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies refine this early qualitative account of multisensory integration. Alais and Burr (2004), found that following progressive degradation in the quality of a visual stimulus, participants' perception of spatial location was determined progressively more by a simultaneous auditory cue.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alais D, Burr D |title=The ventriloquist effect results from near-optimal bimodal integration |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=257–62 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14761661 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.029 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also progressively changed the temporal uncertainty of the auditory cue; eventually concluding that it is the uncertainty of individual modalities that determine to what extent information from each modality is considered when forming a percept.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; This conclusion is similar in some respects to the 'inverse effectiveness rule'. The extent to which multisensory integration occurs may vary according to the ambiguity of the relevant stimuli. In support of this notion, a recent study shows that weak senses such as olfaction can even modulate the perception of visual information as long as the reliability of visual signals is adequately compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=T.|title=Smelling directions: Olfaction modulates ambiguous visual motion perception|journal=Scientific Reports|date=2014|volume=4|pages=5796|doi=10.1038/srep05796|pmid=25052162|pmc=4107342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayesian integration===
The theory of Bayesian integration is based on the fact that the brain must deal with a number of inputs, which vary in reliability.&lt;ref name="Deneve 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deneve S, Pouget A |title=Bayesian multisensory integration and cross-modal spatial links |journal=J. Physiol. Paris |volume=98 |issue=1–3 |pages=249–58 |year=2004 |pmid=15477036 |doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2004.03.011 |url=http://www.gnt.ens.fr/reprints/deneve_jphysparis_2004.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.133.7694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with these inputs, it must construct a coherent representation of the world that corresponds to reality. The Bayesian integration view is that the brain uses a form of [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="Pouget 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pouget A, Deneve S, Duhamel JR |title=A computational perspective on the neural basis of multisensory spatial representations |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=741–7 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12209122 |doi=10.1038/nrn914 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been backed up by computational modeling of such a Bayesian inference from signals to coherent representation, which shows similar characteristics to integration in the brain.&lt;ref name="Pouget 2002"/&gt;

====Cue combination vs. causal inference models====
With the assumption of independence between various sources, traditional cue combination model is successful in modality integration. However, depending on the discrepancies between modalities, there might be different forms of stimuli fusion: integration, partial integration, and segregation. To fully understand the other two types, we have to use causal inference model without the assumption as cue combination model. This freedom gives us general combination of any numbers of signals and modalities by using Bayes' rule to make causal inference of sensory signals.&lt;ref name="Vilares 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Vilares | first1 = I. | last2 = Kording | first2 = K. | title = Bayesian models: the structure of the world, uncertainty, behavior, and the brain. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224 | issue =  | pages = 22–39 |date=Apr 2011 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05965.x | pmid = 21486294 | pmc=3079291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical models====
The difference between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, hierarchical model is actually a special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.

====Independence of likelihoods and priors====
For [[Bayesian network|Bayesian model]], the prior and likelihood generally represent the statistics of the environment and the sensory representations. The independence of priors and likelihoods is not assured since the prior may vary with likelihood only by the representations. However, the independence has been proved by Shams with series of parameter control in multi sensory perception experiment.&lt;ref name="Beierholm 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Beierholm | first1 = UR. | last2 = Quartz | first2 = SR. | last3 = Shams | first3 = L. | title = Bayesian priors are encoded independently from likelihoods in human multisensory perception. | journal = J Vis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 23.1–9 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1167/9.5.23 | pmid = 19757901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The contributions of Barry Stein, Alex Meredith, and their colleagues (e.g."The merging of the senses" 1993,&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stein, Barry |author2=Meredith, M. Alex |title=The merging of the senses |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-19331-3 |oclc=25869284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are widely considered to be the groundbreaking work in the modern field of multisensory integration. Through detailed long-term study of the neurophysiology of the superior colliculus, they distilled three general principles by which multisensory integration may best be described.

*'''The spatial rule'''&lt;ref name="Meredith 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Meredith | first1 = MA. | last2 = Stein | first2 = BE. | title = Spatial factors determine the activity of multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus. | journal = Brain Res | volume = 365 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–4 |date=Feb 1986 | doi =  10.1016/0006-8993(86)91648-3| pmid = 3947999 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899386916483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King AJ, Palmer AR |title=Integration of visual and auditory information in bimodal neurones in the guinea-pig superior colliculus |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=492–500 |year=1985 |pmid=4076371 |doi= 10.1007/bf00236934|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that multisensory integration is more likely or stronger when the constituent unisensory stimuli arise from approximately the same location.
*'''The temporal rule'''&lt;ref name="King 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meredith Nemitz 1987"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Meredith | first1 = MA. | last2 = Nemitz | first2 = JW. | last3 = Stein | first3 = BE. | title = Determinants of multisensory integration in superior colliculus neurons.

===Perceptual and behavioral consequences ===
A unimodal approach dominated scientific literature until the beginning of this century. Although this enabled rapid progression of neural mapping, and an improved understanding of neural structures, the investigation of perception remained relatively stagnant, with a few exceptions.  The recent revitalized enthusiasm into perceptual research is indicative of a substantial shift away from reductionism and toward gestalt methodologies. Gestalt theory, dominant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries espoused two general principles: the 'principle of totality' in which conscious experience must be considered globally, and the 'principle of psychophysical isomorphism' which states that perceptual phenomena are correlated with cerebral activity. Just these ideas were already applied by [[Justo Gonzalo]] in his work of brain dynamics, where a sensory-cerebral correspondence is considered in the formulation of the  "development of the sensory field due to a psychophysical isomorphism" (pag. 23 of the English translation of ref.&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt;).  Both ideas 'principle of totality' and 'psychophysical isomorphism' are particularly relevant in the current climate and have driven researchers to investigate the behavioural benefits of multisensory integration.

===Decreasing sensory uncertainty===
It has been widely acknowledged that uncertainty in sensory domains results in an increased dependence of multisensory integration.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; Hence, it follows that cues from multiple modalities that are both temporally and spatially synchronous are viewed neurally and perceptually as emanating from the same source. The degree of synchrony that is required for this 'binding' to occur is currently being investigated in a variety of approaches. It should be noted here that the integrative function only occurs to a point beyond which the subject can differentiate them as two opposing stimuli. Concurrently, a significant intermediate conclusion can be drawn from the research thus far. Multisensory stimuli that are bound into a single percept, are also bound on the same receptive fields of multisensory neurons in the SC and cortex.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt;

===Decreasing reaction time===
Responses to multiple simultaneous sensory stimuli can be faster than responses to the same stimuli presented in isolation. Hershenson (1962) presented a light and tone simultaneously and separately, and asked human participants to respond as rapidly as possible to them. As the asynchrony between the onsets of both stimuli was varied, it was observed that for certain degrees of asynchrony, reaction times were decreased.&lt;ref name="Hershenson 1962"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hershenson M |title=Reaction time as a measure of intersensory facilitation |journal=J Exp Psychol |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=289–93 |date=March 1962 |pmid=13906889 |doi= 10.1037/h0039516|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These levels of asynchrony were quite small, perhaps reflecting the temporal window that exists in multisensory neurons of the SC. Further studies have analysed the reaction times of saccadic eye movements;&lt;ref name="Hughes 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hughes | first1 = HC. | last2 = Reuter-Lorenz | first2 = PA. | last3 = Nozawa | first3 = G. | last4 = Fendrich | first4 = R. | title = Visual-auditory interactions in sensorimotor processing: saccades versus manual responses. | journal = J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–53 |date=Feb 1994 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.20.1.131 | pmid = 8133219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently correlated these findings to neural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=Mark T.|title=The development of multisensory processes|journal=Cognitive Processing|volume=5|issue=2|year=2004|pages=69–83|issn=1612-4782|doi=10.1007/s10339-004-0017-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients studied by  [[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo]],&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;  with lesions in the parieto-occipital cortex, the decrease in the reaction time to a given stimulus by means of intersensory facilitation was shown to be very remarkable.

====Redundant target effects====
The redundant target effect is the observation that people typically respond faster to double targets (two targets presented simultaneously) than to either of the targets presented alone. This difference in latency is termed the redundancy gain (RG).&lt;ref name="Ridgway 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridgway N, Milders M, Sahraie A |title=Redundant target effect and the processing of colour and luminance |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=153–60 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18264703 |doi=10.1007/s00221-008-1293-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Forster, Cavina-Pratesi, Aglioti, and Berlucchi (2001), normal observers responded faster to simultaneous visual and
tactile stimuli than to single visual or tactile stimuli. RT to simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli was also faster than RT to simultaneous dual visual or tactile stimuli. The advantage for RT to combined visual-tactile stimuli over RT to the other types of stimulation could be accounted for by intersensory neural facilitation rather than by probability summation. These effects can be ascribed to the convergence of tactile and visual inputs onto neural centers which contain flexible multisensory representations of body parts.&lt;ref name="Forster 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster B, Cavina-Pratesi C, Aglioti SM, Berlucchi G |title=Redundant target effect and intersensory facilitation from visual-tactile interactions in simple reaction time |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=143 |issue=4 |pages=480–7 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11914794 |doi=10.1007/s00221-002-1017-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multisensory illusions===

====McGurk effect====
It has been found that two converging bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude than the sum of its parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the [[McGurk effect]],&lt;ref name="McGurk 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGurk H, MacDonald J |title=Hearing lips and seeing voices |journal=Nature |volume=264 |issue=5588 |pages=746–8 |year=1976 |pmid=1012311 |doi=10.1038/264746a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Nath| first1=AR.| last2=Beauchamp| first2=MS.| title=A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion.| journal=NeuroImage| volume=59| issue =1| pages=781–7|date=Jan 2012| doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024| pmid=21787869| pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.&lt;ref name="McGurk 1976"/&gt;

====Ventriloquism====
Ventriloquism has been used as the evidence for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached.&lt;ref name="Hairston 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hairston WD, Wallace MT, Vaughan JW, Stein BE, Norris JL, Schirillo JA |title=Visual localization ability influences cross-modal bias |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–9 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12590840 |doi=10.1162/089892903321107792 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, [[visual capture]] reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – [[electronic voice phenomenon]], mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.

====Double-flash illusion====
The double flash illusion was reported as the first illusion to show that visual stimuli can be qualitatively altered by audio stimuli.&lt;ref name="Shams 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shams L, Kamitani Y, Shimojo S |title=Illusions. What you see is what you hear |journal=Nature |volume=408 |issue=6814 |pages=788 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11130706 |doi=10.1038/35048669 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the standard paradigm participants are presented combinations of one to four flashes accompanied by zero to 4 beeps. They were then asked to say how many flashes they perceived. Participants perceived illusory flashes when there were more beeps than flashes. fMRI studies have shown that there is crossmodal activation in early, low level visual areas, which was qualitatively similar to the perception of a real flash. This suggests that the illusion reflects subjective perception of the extra flash.&lt;ref name="Watkins 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins S, Shams L, Josephs O, Rees G |title=Activity in human V1 follows multisensory perception |journal=NeuroImage |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=572–8 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17604652 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.05.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, studies suggest that timing of multisensory activation in unisensory cortexes is too fast to be mediated by a higher order integration suggesting feed forward or lateral connections.&lt;ref name="Shams 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shams L, Iwaki S, Chawla A, Bhattacharya J |title=Early modulation of visual cortex by sound: an MEG study |journal=Neurosci.

====Rubber hand illusion====
In the rubber hand illusion (RHI),&lt;ref name="Botvinick 1998"/&gt; human participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while they feel a series of identical brushstrokes applied to their own hand, which is hidden from view. If this visual and tactile information is applied synchronously, and if the visual appearance and position of the dummy hand is similar to one's own hand, then people may feel that the touches on their own hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.&lt;ref name="Botvinick 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Botvinick M, Cohen J |title=Rubber hands 'feel' touch that eyes see |journal=Nature |volume=391 |issue=6669 |pages=756 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9486643 |doi=10.1038/35784 |url=http://www.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/publications/1998/BotvinickCohen1998Nature.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an early form of [[body transfer illusion]]. The RHI is an illusion of vision, touch, and posture (proprioception), but a similar illusion can also be induced with touch and proprioception.&lt;ref name="Ehrsson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ehrsson HH, Holmes NP, Passingham RE |title=Touching a rubber hand: feeling of body ownership is associated with activity in multisensory brain areas |journal=J.

====Body transfer illusion====
[[Body transfer illusion]] typically involves the use of virtual reality devices to induce the illusion in the subject that the body of another person or being is the subject's own body.

==Neural mechanisms==

===Subcortical areas===

====Superior colliculus====
[[File:Slide5ff.JPG|thumb|Superior colliculus]]
The [[superior colliculus]] (SC) or optic tectum (OT) is part of the tectum, located in the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities.&lt;ref name="Affifi"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bergman, Ronald A. |author2=Afifi, Adel K. |title=Functional neuroanatomy: text and atlas |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-07-140812-7 |oclc=475017241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the [[spinal cord]] and the inferior colliculus. It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt;

Receptive fields from somatosensory, visual and auditory modalities converge in the deeper layers to form a two-dimensional multisensory map of the external world. Here, objects straight ahead are represented caudally and objects on the periphery are represented rosterally. Similarly, locations in superior sensory space are represented medially, and inferior locations are represented laterally.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"/&gt;

However, in contrast to simple convergence, the SC integrates information to create an output that differs from the sum of its inputs. Following a phenomenon labelled the 'spatial rule', neurons are excited if stimuli from multiple modalities fall on the same or adjacent receptive fields, but are inhibited if the stimuli fall on disparate fields.&lt;ref name="Giard 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giard MH, Peronnet F |title=Auditory-visual integration during multimodal object recognition in humans: a behavioral and electrophysiological study |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=473–90 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10511637 |doi= 10.1162/089892999563544|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excited neurons may then proceed to innervate various muscles and neural structures to orient an individual's behaviour and attention toward the stimulus. Neurons in the SC also adhere to the 'temporal rule', in which stimulation must occur within close temporal proximity to excite neurons. However, due to the varying processing time between modalities and the relatively slower speed of sound to light, it has been found the neurons may be optimally excited when stimulated some time apart.&lt;ref name="Miller 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller LM, D'Esposito M |title=Perceptual fusion and stimulus coincidence in the cross-modal integration of speech |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=25 |pages=5884–93 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15976077 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0896-05.2005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Putamen====
Single neurons in the macaque putamen have been shown to have visual and somatosensory responses closely related to those in the polysensory zone of the premotor cortex and area 7b in the parietal lobe.&lt;ref name="Graziano 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graziano MS, Gross CG |title=A bimodal map of space: somatosensory receptive fields in the macaque putamen with corresponding visual receptive fields |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=96–109 |year=1993 |pmid=8131835 |doi=10.1007/BF00228820 |url=http://neuroinformatics.usc.edu/mediawiki/images/3/39/Graziano_Gross_1993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentile 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gentile | first1 = G. | last2 = Petkova | first2 = VI. | last3 = Ehrsson | first3 = HH. | title = Integration of visual and tactile signals from the hand in the human brain: an FMRI study. | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 910–22 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00840.2010 | pmid = 21148091 | pmc = 3059180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cortical areas===
Multisensory neurons exist in a large number of locations, often integrated with unimodal neurons. They have recently been discovered in areas previously thought to be modality specific, such as the somatosensory cortex; as well as in clusters at the borders between the major cerebral lobes, such as the occipito-parietal space and the occipito-temporal space.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace Ramachandran 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace MT, Ramachandran R, Stein BE |title=A revised view of sensory cortical parcellation |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=2167–72 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14766982 |pmc=357070 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0305697101 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in order to undergo such physiological changes, there must exist continuous connectivity between these multisensory structures. It is generally agreed that information flow within the cortex follows a hierarchical configuration.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clavagnier S, Falchier A, Kennedy H |title=Long-distance feedback projections to area V1: implications for multisensory integration, spatial awareness, and visual consciousness |journal=Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15460918 |doi=10.3758/CABN.4.2.117 |url=http://www.seco-project.eu/dev/labo/files/publications/clavagnier%2004%20cabneuro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubel and Wiesel showed that receptive fields and thus the function of cortical structures, as one proceeds out from V1 along the visual pathways, become increasingly complex and specialized.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; From this it was postulated that information flowed outwards in a feed forward fashion; the complex end products eventually binding to form a percept. However, via fMRI and intracranial recording technologies, it has been observed that the activation time of successive levels of the hierarchy does not correlate with a feed forward structure. That is, late activation has been observed in the striate cortex, markedly after activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to the same stimulus.&lt;ref name="Foxe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foxe JJ, Simpson GV |title=Flow of activation from V1 to frontal cortex in humans. A framework for defining "early" visual processing |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=139–50 |date=January 2002 |pmid=11797091 |doi=10.1007/s00221-001-0906-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this, afferent nerve fibres have been found that project to early visual areas such as the lingual gyrus from late in the dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams, as well as from the auditory association cortex.&lt;ref name="Macaluso 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso E, Frith CD, Driver J |title=Modulation of human visual cortex by crossmodal spatial attention |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5482 |pages=1206–8 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10947990 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5482.1206 |citeseerx=10.1.1.420.5403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato ''et al.'' (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein ''et al.'' (2002), that the primary auditory cortex (A1) was functionally distinct from the auditory association cortex, in that it was void of any interaction with the visual modality. They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by [[cross modal plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sadato N, Yamada H, Okada T, etal |title=Age-dependent plasticity in the superior temporal sulcus in deaf humans: a functional MRI study |journal=BMC Neurosci |volume=5 |issue= |pages=56 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15588277 |pmc=539237 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-5-56 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein LE, Auer ET, Moore JK, Ponton CW, Don M, Singh M |title=Visual speech perception without primary auditory cortex activation |journal=NeuroReport |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=311–5 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11930129  |url=http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2002&amp;issue=03040&amp;article=00013&amp;type=abstract |doi=10.1097/00001756-200203040-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality.&lt;ref name="Jones 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones EG, Powell TP |title=An anatomical study of converging sensory pathways within the cerebral cortex of the monkey |journal=Brain |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=793–820 |year=1970 |pmid=4992433 |doi=10.1093/brain/93.4.793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the dorsal auditory pathway, projecting from the temporal lobe is largely concerned with processing spatial information, and contains receptive fields that are topographically organized. Fibers from this region project directly to neurons governing corresponding receptive fields in V1.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; The perceptual consequences of this have not yet been empirically acknowledged. However, it can be hypothesized that these projections may be the precursors of increased acuity and emphasis of visual stimuli in relevant areas of perceptual space. Consequently, this finding rejects Jones and Powell's (1970) hypothesis&lt;ref name="Jones 1970"/&gt; and thus is in conflict with Sadato ''et al.'''s (2004) findings.&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"/&gt; A resolution to this discrepancy includes the possibility that primary sensory areas can not be classified as a single group, and thus may be far more different from what was previously thought.

The multisensory syndrome with symmetric bilaterality, characterized
by [[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo]] and called by this author `central syndrome of the cortex',&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt; was originated from a unilateral parieto-occipital cortical lesion equidistant from the visual, tactile, and auditory projection areas
(the middle of area 19, the anterior part of area 18 and the most posterior of area 39, in Brodmann terminology) that was called `central zone'. The gradation observed between syndromes led this author to propose a functional gradient scheme in which the specificity of the cortex is distributed with a continuous variation,&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt; the overlap of the specific gradients would be high or maximum  in that ` central zone'.

Further research is necessary for a definitive resolution.

Superior temporal cortex (STG/STS/PT) Audio visual cross modal interactions are known to occur in the auditory association cortex which lies directly inferior to the Sylvian fissure in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"/&gt; Plasticity was observed in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) by Petitto ''et al.'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Petitto 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petitto LA, Zatorre RJ, Gauna K, Nikelski EJ, Dostie D, Evans AC |title=Speech-like cerebral activity in profoundly deaf people processing signed languages: implications for the neural basis of human language |journal=Proc.

Concurrently, further research has revealed differences in the activation of the Planum temporale (PT) in response to non linguistic lip movements between the hearing and deaf; as well as progressively increasing activation of the auditory association cortex as previously deaf participants gain hearing experience via a cochlear implant.&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"/&gt;

Rostral lateral suprasylvian sulcus (rLS) in cats&lt;ref name="Jiang 2001"/&gt;

===Cortical-subcortical interactions===
The most significant interaction between these two systems (corticotectal interactions) is the connection between the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES), which lies at the junction of the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes, and the SC. The AES is divided into three unimodal regions with multisensory neurons at the junctions between these sections.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang W, Stein BE |title=Cortex controls multisensory depression in superior colliculus |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=2123–35 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14534263 |doi=10.1152/jn.00369.2003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jiang &amp; Stein, 2003). Neurons from the unimodal regions project to the deep layers of the SC and influence the multiplicative integration effect. That is, although they can receive inputs from all modalities as normal, the SC can not enhance or depress the effect of multisensory stimulation without input from the AES.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"/&gt;

Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, although also integrally connected to unimodal AES neurons, are not directly connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected in other areas of the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated.&lt;ref name="Wallace 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace MT, Meredith MA, Stein BE |title=Converging influences from visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices onto output neurons of the superior colliculus |journal=J.

Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, cortical neurons governing perception, and a separate sub cortical system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream.&lt;ref name="Goodale 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodale MA, Milner AD |title=Separate visual pathways for perception and action |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–5 |date=January 1992 |pmid=1374953 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(92)90344-8 |url=http://www.sybergroup.com/docs/Pathways2.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made.

===Dual "what" and "where" multisensory routes===
Research suggests the existence of two multisensory routes for "what" and "where".  The "what" route identifying the identity of things involving area [[Brodmann area 9]] in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and right [[middle frontal gyrus]], [[Brodmann area 13]] and [[Brodmann area 45]] in the right [[Insular cortex|insula]]-inferior frontal gyrus area, and [[Brodmann area 13]] bilaterally in the insula. The  "where" route detecting their spatial attributes involving the [[Brodmann area 40]] in the right and left [[inferior parietal lobule]] and the [[Brodmann area 7]] in the right [[precuneus]]-[[superior parietal lobule]] and [[Brodmann area 7]] in

==Development of multisensory operations==

=== Theories of development ===

All species equipped with multiple sensory systems, utilize them in an integrative manner to achieve action and perception.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"/&gt; However, in most species, especially higher mammals and humans, the ability to integrate develops in parallel with physical and cognitive maturity. Children until certain ages do not show mature integration patterns.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008" /&gt; Classically, two opposing views that are principally modern manifestations of the nativist/empiricist dichotomy have been put forth. The integration (empiricist) view states that at birth, sensory modalities are not at all connected. Hence, it is only through active exploration that plastic changes can occur in the nervous system to initiate holistic perceptions and actions. Conversely, the differentiation (nativist) perspective asserts that the young nervous system is highly interconnected; and that during development, modalities are gradually differentiated as relevant connections are rehearsed and the irrelevant are discarded.&lt;ref name="Lewkowicz 2004"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = D | last2 = Kraebel | first2 = K | title = The value of multisensory redundancy in the development of intersensory perception | editors = Gemma Calvert; Charles Spence; Barry E Stein | work = The Handbook of multisensory processes | publisher = MIT Press, cop.  | year = 2004 | location = Cambridge, Mass | pages = 655–78 | isbn = 9780262033213 | oclc = 803222288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the SC as a model, the nature of this dichotomy can be analysed. In the newborn cat, deep layers of the SC contain only neurons responding to the somatosensory modality. Within a week, auditory neurons begin to occur, but it is not until two weeks after birth that the first multisensory neurons appear. Further changes continue, with the arrival of visual neurons after three weeks, until the SC has achieved its fully mature structure after three to four months. Concurrently in species of monkey, newborns are endowed with a significant complement of multisensory cells; however, along with cats there is no integration effect apparent until much later.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt; This delay is thought to be the result of the relatively slower development of cortical structures including the AES; which as stated above, is essential for the existence of the integration effect.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"/&gt;

Furthermore, it was found by Wallace (2004) that cats raised in a light deprived environment had severely underdeveloped visual receptive fields in deep layers of the SC.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt; Although, receptive field size has been shown to decrease with maturity, the above finding suggests that integration in the SC is a function of experience. Nevertheless, the existence of visual multisensory neurons, despite a complete lack of visual experience, highlights the apparent relevance of nativist viewpoints. Multisensory development in the cortex has been studied to a lesser extent, however a similar study to that presented above was performed on cats whose optic nerves had been severed. These cats displayed a marked improvement in their ability to localize stimuli through audition; and consequently also showed increased neural connectivity between V1 and the auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt;  Such plasticity in early childhood allows for greater adaptability, and thus more normal development in other areas for those with a sensory deficit.

In contrast, following the initial formative period, the SC does not appear to display any neural plasticity. Despite this, habituation and sensititisation over the long term is known to exist in orientation behaviors. This apparent plasticity in function has been attributed to the adaptability of the AES. That is, although neurons in the SC have a fixed magnitude of output per unit input, and essentially operate an all or nothing response, the level of neural firing can be more finely tuned by variations in input by the AES.

Although there is evidence for either perspective of the integration/differentiation dichotomy, a significant body of evidence also exists for a combination of factors from either view. Thus, analogous to the broader nativist/empiricist argument, it is apparent that rather than a dichotomy, there exists a continuum, such that the integration and differentiation hypotheses are extremes at either end.

=== Psychophysical development of integration ===
Not much is known about the development of the ability to integrate multiple estimates such as vision and touch.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt; Some multisensory abilities are present from early infancy, but it is not until children are eight years or older before they use multiple modalities to reduce sensory uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt;
 
One study demonstrated that cross-modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life.&lt;ref name="Neil et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neil|first=PA|author2=Chee-Ruiter, C |author3=Scheier, C |author4=Lewkowicz, DJ |author5= Shimojo, S |title=Development of multisensory spatial integration and perception in humans.|journal=Developmental Science|date=Sep 2006|volume=9|issue=5|pages=454–64|pmid=16911447|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00512.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study measured response time for orientating towards a source. Infants who were 8–10 months old showed significantly decreased response times when the source was presented through both [[visual perception|visual]] and [[Hearing|auditory]] information compared to a single [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, the results of the study indicates that children potentially have the capacity to integrate sensory sources at any age. However, in certain cases, for example [[visual cues#visual cues|visual cues]], intermodal integration is avoided.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another study found that cross-modal integration of [[Haptic perception|touch]] and [[visual perception|vision]] for distinguishing size and [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] is available from at least 8 years of age.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gori|first=M |author2=Del Viva, M |author3=Sandini, G |author4=Burr, DC |title=Young children do not integrate visual and haptic form information.|journal=Current Biology|date=May 6, 2008|volume=18|issue=9|pages=694–8|pmid=18450446|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For pre-integration age groups, one sense dominates depending on the characteristic discerned (see [[#Visual dominance|visual dominance]]).&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;

A study investigating sensory integration ''within'' a single [[Stimulus modality|modality]] ([[Visual perception|vision]]) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nardini|first=M|author2=Bedford, R |author3=Mareschal, D |title=Fusion of visual cues is not mandatory in children.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Sep 28, 2010|volume=107|issue=39|pages=17041–6|pmid=20837526|doi=10.1073/pnas.1001699107|pmc=2947870}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular study assessed the integration of [[Binocular disparity|disparity]] and [[Texture gradient|texture]] cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a somewhat better performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt; In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning that they no longer have access to the individual sensory sources.&lt;ref name="Hills et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillis|first=JM|author2=Ernst, MO |author3=Banks, MS |author4= Landy, MS |title=Combining sensory information: mandatory fusion within, but not between, senses.|journal=Science|date=Nov 22, 2002|volume=298|issue=5598|pages=1627–30|pmid=12446912|doi=10.1126/science.1075396|citeseerx=10.1.1.278.6134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging these variations, many hypotheses have been established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both [[Stimulus modality|modalities]] have reached maturity.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ernst|first=MO|title=Multisensory integration: a late bloomer.|journal=Current Biology|date=Jun 24, 2008|volume=18|issue=12|pages=R519–21|pmid=18579094|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and [[human height|stature]] (affecting viewing height), but there is also change in inter-ocular distance and [[eyeball]] length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the [[superior colliculus]] providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stein|first=BE|author2=Meredith, MA |author3=Wallace, MT |title=The visually responsive neuron and beyond: multisensory integration in cat and monkey.|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=1993|volume=95|pages=79–90|pmid=8493355|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(08)60359-3|isbn=9780444894922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until unimodal properties are fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=BE|author2=Labos, E |author3=Kruger, L |title=Sequence of changes in properties of neurons of superior colliculus of the kitten during maturation.|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=Jul 1973|volume=36|issue=4|pages=667–79|pmid=4713313|doi=10.1152/jn.1973.36.4.667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=MT|author2=Stein, BE|title=Sensory and multisensory responses in the newborn monkey superior colliculus.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=Nov 15, 2001|volume=21|issue=22|pages=8886–94|pmid=11698600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, to rationalize sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates that the brain utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; In this case, [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the [[retina]], irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of [[neurons]] within [[primate]] [[visual cortex|visual cortices']] are their discernment to orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tootell|first=RB|author2=Hadjikhani, NK |author3=Vanduffel, W |author4=Liu, AK |author5=Mendola, JD |author6=Sereno, MI |author7= Dale, AM |title=Functional analysis of primary visual cortex (V1) in humans.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Feb 3, 1998|volume=95|issue=3|pages=811–7|pmid=9448245|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.811 |pmc=33802}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[haptic perception|haptic]] orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned [[haptic perception|haptic]] information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as [[angle|slant]] and [[distance]]. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source could be used to tweak the accuracy of the alternate source.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the [[haptic perception|haptic]] workspace (i.e. at arm's reach).&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gori|first=M|author2=Giuliana, L |author3=Sandini, G |author4= Burr, D |title=Visual size perception and haptic calibration during development.|journal=Developmental Science|date=Nov 2012|volume=15|issue=6|pages=854–62|pmid=23106739|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.2012.01183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granrud|first=CE|author2=Schmechel, TT|title=Development of size constancy in children: a test of the proximal mode sensitivity hypothesis.|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=Nov 2006|volume=68|issue=8|pages=1372–81|pmid=17378423|doi=10.3758/bf03193736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2012"/&gt; These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]] over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt;
 
Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that efficient integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt; Indeed, studies have shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived [[space|spatial]] separation, suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gepshtein|first=S|author2=Burge, J |author3=Ernst, MO |author4= Banks, MS |title=The combination of vision and touch depends on spatial proximity.|journal=Journal of Vision|date=Dec 28, 2005|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1013–23|pmid=16441199 |doi=10.1167/5.11.7 |pmc=2632311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a [[mirror]], integration is re-established and can even be optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helbig|first=HB|author2=Ernst, MO|title=Optimal integration of shape information from vision and touch.|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=Jun 2007|volume=179|issue=4|pages=595–606|pmid=17225091|doi=10.1007/s00221-006-0814-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helbig|first=HB|author2=Ernst, MO|title=Knowledge about a common source can promote visual- haptic integration.|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36|issue=10|pages=1523–33|pmid=18265835|doi=10.1068/p5851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young children could be deficient in this area.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt; Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.

Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) recently hypothesised that young children have optimized their sensory appreciation for speed over accuracy.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt; When information is presented in two forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt; Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hills et al. 2002" /&gt; However, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them to keep up with the mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kail|first=RV|author2=Ferrer, E|title=Processing speed in childhood and adolescence: longitudinal models for examining developmental change.|journal=Child Development|date=Nov–Dec 2007|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1760–70|pmid=17988319|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kail|first=R|title=Developmental change in speed of processing during childhood and adolescence.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=May 1991|volume=109|issue=3|pages=490–501|pmid=2062981|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.3.490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ballard|first=DH|author2=Hayhoe, MM |author3=Pook, PK |author4= Rao, RP |title=Deictic codes for the embodiment of cognition.|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=Dec 1997|volume=20|issue=4|pages=723–42; discussion 743–67|pmid=10097009|doi=10.1017/s0140525x97001611|citeseerx=10.1.1.49.3813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – ''speed and detecting sensory conflicts'' – those typical of objective learning.

The late development of efficient integration has also been investigated from computational point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reward Maximization Justifies the Transition from Sensory Selection at Childhood to Sensory Integration at Adulthood|journal = PLoS ONE|pmc = 4110011|pmid = 25058591|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0103143|first = Pedram|last = Daee|first2 = Maryam S.|last2 = Mirian|first3 = Majid Nili|last3 = Ahmadabadi|pages=e103143|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daee et al. (2014) showed that having one dominant sensory source at early age, rather than integrating all sources, facilitates the overall development of cross-modal integrations.

==== Prosthesis ====

Prosthetics designers should carefully consider the nature of dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized in a way that the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased as you approach the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption. 
Although the current commercially available prosthetic devices mainly focusing in implementing the motor side by simply uses EMG sensors to switch between different activation states of the prosthesis. Very limited works have proposed a system to involve by integrating the sensory side. The integration of tactile sense and proprioception is regarded as essential for implementing the ability to perceive environmental input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rincon-Gonzalez L, WarrenJ P | year = 2011 | title = Haptic interaction of touch and proprioception: implications for neuroprosthetics | url = | journal = IEEE Trans.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Objections to evolution''' have been raised since [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary ideas]] came to prominence in the 19th century. When [[Charles Darwin]] published his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', his theory of [[evolution]] (the idea that [[species]] arose through [[common descent|descent with modification from a single common ancestor]] in a process driven by [[natural selection]]) initially met opposition from [[scientist]]s with [[Alternatives to Darwinism|different theories]], but eventually came to receive [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|overwhelming acceptance]] in the [[scientific community]]. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]] explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream [[biologist]]s since the 1940s.

Since then, most criticisms and denials of evolution have come from [[Religion|religious]] groups, rather than from the scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through [[theistic evolution]], other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of [[creationism]], the belief that the universe and life were created by [[supernatural]] forces. The [[United States|U.S.]]-centered [[creation–evolution controversy]] has become a focal point of perceived conflict between [[relationship between religion and science|religion and science]].

Several branches of creationism, including [[creation science]], [[neo-creationism]], and [[intelligent design]], argue that the idea of life being directly designed by a [[god]] or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in [[creation and evolution in public education|public education]]. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's [[scientific evidence|evidence]], [[methodology]], plausibility, [[morality]], and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the [[scientific method]], evidence, and basic [[physical law]]s.

==History==
{{further|History of evolutionary thought|History of creationism|Creation–evolution controversy}}
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] gained widespread acceptance as a description of the origin of species, but there was continued resistance to his views on the significance of [[natural selection]] as the mechanism of evolution.]]

Evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the early 19th century with the theory of the [[transmutation of species]] put forward by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]].  Evolution was at first opposed among the scientific community, notably by [[Georges Cuvier]], and religious grounds.&lt;ref name="icj"&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=Ian C. |year=1999 |chapter=Section Three: The Origins of Evolutionary Theory |chapterurl=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect3.htm |title=. . .

When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book ''On the Origin of Species'', he convinced most of the scientific community that new species arise through descent through modification in a branching pattern of divergence from [[common descent|common ancestors]], but while most scientists accepted that natural selection is a valid and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]]ly testable [[hypothesis]], Darwin's view that it is the primary mechanism of evolution was rejected by some.&lt;ref name=darwin-online-2002-van-wyhe-complete /&gt;

Darwin's contemporaries eventually came to accept the transmutation of species based upon [[fossil]] evidence, and the [[X Club]] was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/November.html |title=Darwin's Timeline: November |date=February 10, 2008 |website=AboutDarwin.com |publisher=David Leff |location=Eugene, OR |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided of [[natural selection]] was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as [[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]]. Darwin's [[gradualism|gradualistic]] account was also opposed by [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]] and [[catastrophism]]. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] led scientific opposition to gradualism on the basis of his thermodynamic calculations that the [[Earth]] was [[Age of the Earth|between 24 and 400 million years old]], and own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This age of the earth was disputed by geological estimates, which gained strength in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old.&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=England |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip England |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter |last3=Righter |first3=Frank |date=January 2007 |title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |journal=GSA Today |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |issn=1052-5173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boltwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boltwood |first=Bertram B. |authorlink=Bertram Boltwood |date=February 1907 |title=On the Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-Active Elements.

Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as [[genetics]], which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protestantism]], especially in America, broke out in "acrid polemics" and argument about evolution from 1860 to the 1870s—with the turning point possibly marked by the death of [[Louis Agassiz]] in 1873—and by 1880 a form of "[[Christian]] evolution" was becoming the consensus.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1979|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, while publication of ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' by Darwin in 1871 reinvigorated debate from the previous decade, [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Sir Henry Chadwick]] notes a steady acceptance of evolution "among more educated Christians" between 1860 and 1885. As a result, evolutionary theory was "both permissible and respectable" by 1876.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; [[Frederick Temple]]'s lectures on ''The Relations between Religion and Science'' (1884) on how evolution was not "antagonistic" to religion highlighted this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|1884|loc=Lecture IV: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17194/17194-h/17194-h.htm#LECTURE_IV "Apparent Conflict Between Religion and the Doctrine of Evolution"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple's appointment as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1896 demonstrated the broad acceptance of evolution within the church hierarchy.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

For decades the [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] avoided official refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could be reconciled with the [[Bible]], as this conflicted with the [[First Vatican Council]]'s (1869–70) finding that everything was created [[Ex nihilo|out of nothing]] by God, and to deny that finding could lead to [[excommunication]]. In 1950, the [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'' of [[Pope Pius XII]] first mentioned evolution directly and officially.&lt;ref name=vatican-1950-08-12-pope-pius-xii /&gt; It allowed one to enquire into the concept of [[human]]s coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question [[Adam and Eve]] or the creation of the [[soul]]. In 1996, [[Pope John Paul II]] said that evolution is "more than a hypothesis" and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is "incompatible with the truth about man."&lt;ref name=caltech-1996-10-30-pope-john-paul-ii /&gt; Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato.html|title=24 April 2005: Mass for the inauguration of the Pontificate {{!}} BENEDICT XVI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he has promoted the study of the relationship between the concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason.&lt;ref&gt;See John Allen's essay at https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/benedicts-thinking-creation-and-evolution. See also Christoph Cardinal Schönborn's exposition "Benedict XVI. on 'Creation and Evolution'": http://www.pas.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/acta20/acta20-schoenbornen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomisticevolution.org/|title=Thomistic Evolution|website=www.thomisticevolution.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]] reaction ranged from those believing in literal creation from the [[Quran]] to many educated Muslims who subscribed to a version of theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval [[madrasa]]hs taught the ideas of [[Al-Jahiz]], a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection.&lt;ref name=hssrd-2002-summer-majid /&gt; However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning [[philosophy]] of [[materialism]] as unsound to human origins and a denial of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name=hssrd-2002-summer-majid /&gt; Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name="EvoDeceit"&gt;{{harvnb|Yahya|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of acceptance from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used in opposition to evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis account of Creation]]. Believers in [[Biblical infallibility]] attacked [[Darwinism]] as heretical. The [[natural theology]] of the early 19th century was typified by [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]], an [[teleological argument|argument from design]] still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans.&lt;ref name=Darwin&amp;design&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Correspondence of Charles Darwin#Darwin Correspondence Project website|Darwin Correspondence Project]] |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]; [[American Council of Learned Societies]] |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327005203/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2015-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been adopted by denominations of [[Christianity]] and [[Jewish views on evolution|Judaism]] in line with [[Liberal Christianity|modernist theology]] which views the Bible and [[Torah]] as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.

However, in the 1920s [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] in the [[United States]] developed their [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] arguments against modernist theology into opposition to the teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting to the teaching of evolution in [[State school#United States|public school]]s. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name="SM07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

Since then creationists have developed more nuanced objections to evolution, alleging variously that it is unscientific, infringes on creationists' [[freedom of religion|religious freedoms]], or that the acceptance of evolution is a religious stance.&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;{{harvnb|Ham|1987|loc=Chapter 2: [http://www.creationists.org/evolutionism-is-a-religion.html "Evolution is Religion"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists have appealed to democratic principles of fairness, arguing that evolution is controversial and that science classrooms should therefore "[[Teach the Controversy]]."&lt;ref name="wedge" /&gt; These objections to evolution culminated in the [[intelligent design movement]] in the 1990s and early 2000s that [[Kitzmiller v.

==Defining evolution==
{{further|Evolution (term)}}

One of the main sources of confusion and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate is the definition of ''evolution'' itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from [[evolutionary computation]] to [[molecular evolution]] to [[sociocultural evolution]] to [[stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]]. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about [[abiogenesis]] or the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Biston.betularia.7200.jpg |image2=Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg|width=200| caption1=White [[peppered moth]] |caption2=Black morph in [[peppered moth evolution]]. Even minor variation in a population can lead to evolution by natural selection.}}

''Evolution'' in colloquial contexts can refer to any sort of progressive development or gradual improvement, and a process that results in greater quality or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evolution| title = Definition of Evolution| publisher = merriam-webster.com| access-date = 4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When misapplied to biological evolution this common meaning leads to frequent misunderstandings. For example, the idea of [[Devolution (biology)|devolution]] ("backwards" evolution) is a result of erroneously assuming that evolution is directional or has a specific goal in mind (cf. orthogenesis). In reality, the evolution of an organism has no "objective" and is only showing increasing ability of successive generations to survive and reproduce in its environment; and increased suitability is only defined in relation to this environment. Biologists do not consider any one species, such as humans, to be more ''highly evolved'' or ''advanced'' than another. Certain sources have been criticized for indicating otherwise due to a tendency to evaluate nonhuman organisms according to [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] standards rather than more objective ones.&lt;ref name="devolving"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dougherty |first=Michael J. |date=July 20, 1998 |title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution also does not require that organisms become more complex. Although the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]] shows an apparent trend towards the [[evolution of biological complexity]]; there is a question if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B. Carroll |date=February 22, 2001 |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–1109 |doi=10.1038/35059227 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11234024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus [[natural selection|naturally selected]] for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.&lt;ref name="devolving" /&gt;

Creationist sources frequently define evolution according to a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of [[evolutionary biology]] (see [[Straw man|straw man argument]]). This also means that advocates of creationism and [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]s often simply speak past each other.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

==Scientific acceptance==

===Status as a theory===
{{further|Evolution as fact and theory}}

Critics of evolution assert that evolution is "just a theory," which emphasizes that scientific theories are never absolute, or misleadingly presents it as a matter of opinion rather than of fact or evidence.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-fact /&gt; This reflects a difference of the meaning of ''[[theory]]'' in a scientific context: whereas in colloquial speech a ''theory'' is a conjecture or guess, in [[scientific theory|science a theory]] is an explanation whose predictions have been verified by experiments or other evidence. ''Evolutionary theory'' refers to an explanation for the diversity of species and their ancestry which has met extremely high standards of scientific evidence. An example of evolution as theory is the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. As with any scientific theory, the modern synthesis is constantly debated, tested, and refined by scientists, but there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that it remains the only robust model that accounts for the known facts concerning evolution.&lt;ref name=aaas-2006-2-16-statement-teaching-evolution /&gt;

Critics also state that evolution is not a [[fact]].&lt;ref name="MentonFact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mall.turnpike.net/C/cs/theory.htm |title=Is Evolution a Theory, a Fact, or a Law? |last=Menton |first=David N. |year=1993 |work=Missouri Association for Creation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914223848/http://mall.turnpike.net/C/cs/theory.htm |archivedate=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2010-06-16}} "Originally published in: St. Louis MetroVoice, October 1993, Vol. 3, No. 10"&lt;/ref&gt; In science a fact is a verified empirical observation while in colloquial contexts a fact can simply refer to anything for which there is overwhelming evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as "[[Heliocentrism|the Earth revolves around the Sun]]" and "objects fall due to gravity" may be referred to as "facts," even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a "fact" for the same reason that gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered [[Evolution as fact and theory|both a theory and a fact]] by scientists.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-fact /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-10-1-faq-misconceptions-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref name="gouldfact"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1983|pp=253–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar confusion is involved in objections that evolution is "unproven," since no theory in science is known to be absolutely true, only verified by [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is an important one in [[philosophy of science]], as it relates to the lack of absolute [[certainty]] in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict [[proof theory|proof]] is possible only in [[formal science]]s such as logic and mathematics, not [[natural science]]s (where terms such as "validated" or "corroborated" are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a "theory." The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of ''proof'' is simply "compelling evidence," in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution "proven."&lt;ref name="Theobald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html |title=Scientific 'Proof', scientific evidence, and the scientific method |last=Theobald |first=Douglas |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}} Version 2.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

An objection is often made in the [[Creation and evolution in public education in the United States#Kansas|teaching of evolution]] that evolution is controversial or contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratliff |first=Evan |authorlink=Evan Ratliff |date=October 2004 |title=The Crusade Against Evolution |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html?pg=2 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |issue=12.10 |issn=1059-1028 |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="equal" /&gt;  Unlike past creationist arguments which sought to abolish the teaching of evolution altogether, this argument makes the weaker claim that evolution should be presented alongside alternative views since it is controversial, and students should be allowed to evaluate and choose between the options on their own.&lt;ref name="equal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA040.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA040: Equal time |date=September 25, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meyer |first=Stephen C. |authorlink=Stephen C.

This objection forms the basis of the "[[Teach the Controversy]]" campaign by the [[Discovery Institute]], a [[think tank]] based in Seattle, Washington, to promote the teaching of intelligent design in U.S. public schools.  This goal followed the Institute's "[[wedge strategy]]," an attempt to gradually undermine evolution and ultimately to "reverse the stifling dominance of the  [[materialism|materialist]] worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."&lt;ref name="wedge"&gt;A copy of the [[Discovery Institute]]'s ''[[wedge strategy]]'' document can be found here: {{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |title=The Wedge |year=1999 |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-24}} pg 6 Five Year Strategic Plan Summary end of para 1 "We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."&lt;/ref&gt; Several other attempts were made to insert intelligent design or creationism into the U.S. public school curriculum, including the failed [[Santorum Amendment]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost-2005-8-2-gwb /&gt;

Scientists and U.S. courts have rejected this objection on the grounds that science is not based on [[Argumentum ad populum|appeals to popularity]], but on evidence. The [[scientific consensus]] of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAP_2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx |title=IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution |author=IAP Member Academies |date=June 21, 2006 |website=[[InterAcademy Panel|IAP]] |publisher=[[TWAS|The World Academy of Sciences]] |location=Trieste, Italy |accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, creationists have disputed the level of scientific [[Level of support for evolution|support for evolution]]. The Discovery Institute has gathered over 761 scientists as of August 2008 to sign ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]'' in order to show that there are a number of scientists who dispute what they refer to as "Darwinian evolution." This statement did not profess outright disbelief in evolution, but expressed skepticism as to the ability of "random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life." Several counter-petitions have been launched in turn, including ''[[A Scientific Support for Darwinism]]'', which gathered over 7,000 signatures in four days,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Ask Science |first=Kenneth |last= Chang |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 21, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/ask-science.html |accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Project Steve]], a tongue-in-cheek petition that has gathered the signatures of 1,393 (as of May 24, 2016) evolution-supporting scientists named "Steve" (or any similar variation thereof—Stephen, Stephanie, Esteban, etc.).&lt;ref name="PS1200"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2012/04/project-steve-n-1200-007293 |title=Project Steve: n &gt; 1200 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 6, 2012 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=May 24, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationists have argued for over a century that evolution is a "theory in crisis" that will soon be overturned, based on objections that it lacks reliable evidence or violates natural laws. These objections have been rejected by most scientists, as have claims that intelligent design, or any other creationist explanation, meets the basic scientific standards that would be required to make them scientific alternatives to evolution. It is also argued that even if evidence against evolution exists, it is a [[false dilemma]] to characterize this as evidence ''for'' intelligent design.&lt;ref name=entouch-2002-morton-imminent-demise /&gt;

A similar objection to evolution is that certain scientific authorities—mainly pre-modern ones—have doubted or rejected evolution.&lt;ref name="creationsafaris4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creationsafaris.com/wgcs_4.htm |title=Shining Through Materialistic Darkness |last=Coppedge |first=David F. |year=2000 |work=The World's Greatest Creation Scientists: From Y1K to Y2K |publisher=CreationSafaris.com |location=Chesterbrook, PA |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624225502/http://www.creationsafaris.com/wgcs_4.htm |archive-date=2016-06-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, it is argued that Darwin "recanted" on his deathbed, a false anecdote originating from [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope's story]].&lt;ref name="ChristianAnswers.Net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/darwin.html |title=Was Darwin a Christian?

==Scientific status==
A common neo-creationist objection to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that it is not genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the [[scientific method]] and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the very nature of evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and [[philosophy of science]].

===Religious nature===
{{further|Relationship between religion and science|Scientism}}

Creationists commonly argue that "evolution is a religion; it is not a science."&lt;ref name="ham" /&gt; The purpose of this criticism is to reframe the debate from one between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to between two religious beliefs—or even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembski|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notscience"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M. Morris |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/imp/imp-332.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evolution Is Religion—Not Science |journal=Impact |location=El Cajon, CA |publisher=[[Institute for Creation Research]] |issue=332 |pages=i–iv |oclc=8153605 |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that oppose evolution frequently refer to supporters of evolution as "evolutionists" or "[[Darwinism|Darwinists]]."&lt;ref name="ham" /&gt;

The arguments for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by [[analogy]]: it is argued that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on [[faith]],&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt; and that supporters of evolution [[dogma]]tically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiker |first=Benjamin D. |authorlink=Benjamin Wiker |date=July–August 2003 |title=Part II: The Christian Critics — Does Science Point to God? |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/2003/part-ii-the-christian-critics-does-science-point-to-god |journal=Crisis Magazine |publisher=Morley Publishing Group |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of evolution have argued in response that no scientist's claims are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first [[neo-Darwinism]] and later the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA611.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA611: Evolution Sacrosanct? |date=February 15, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

The argument that evolution is religious has been rejected in general on the grounds that ''religion'' is not defined by how dogmatic or zealous its adherents are, but by its spiritual or supernatural beliefs. Evolutionary supporters point out evolution is neither dogmatic nor based on faith, and they accuse creationists of [[equivocation|equivocating]] between the strict definition of ''religion'' and its colloquial usage to refer to anything that is enthusiastically or dogmatically engaged in. United States courts have also rejected this objection:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, [[Epperson v. Arkansas]], supra, [[Willoughby v. Stever]], No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); [[Wright v. Houston Independent School District|Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist.]], 366 F. Supp. 1208 (S.D. Tex 1978), aff.d. 486 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied 417 U.S. 969 (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education |vol=529 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1255 |court=E.D. Ark. |year=1982 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A related claim is that evolution is [[Atheism|atheistic]] (see the [[#Atheism|Atheism]] section below); creationists sometimes merge the two claims and describe evolution as an "atheistic religion" (cf. [[humanism]]).&lt;ref name="notscience" /&gt; This argument against evolution is also frequently generalized into a criticism of all science; it is argued that "science is an atheistic religion," on the grounds that its [[naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|methodological naturalism]] is as unproven, and thus as "faith-based," as the supernatural and theistic beliefs of creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismscienceevolution/a/ScienceFaith.htm |title=Myth: Science is a Religion for Atheists that Requires Faith |last=Cline |first=Austin |year=2006 |website=[[About.com]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=New York |accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfalsifiability{{anchor|Evolution is unfalsifiable}}===
A statement is considered [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] if there is an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the statement is false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as [[Henry M. Morris]] have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.&lt;ref name="CA211"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA211.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA211: Evolution falsifiable |date=March 3, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of evolution argue that evolution could be falsified by many conceivable lines of evidence, such as the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] showing no change over time, confirmation that mutations are prevented from accumulating in a population, or observation of organisms being created supernaturally or spontaneously.&lt;ref name="CA211" /&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied "[[Precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Claudia|date=August 7, 2005|title=The Evolution Wars|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-1,00.html|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2015-03-30|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed.&lt;ref name="Theobald" /&gt; For example, the fact that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than the [[Hominidae|great apes]] offered a testable hypothesis involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor. The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that [[Chromosome 2 (human)|human chromosome 2]] is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other [[primate]]s. Extra, inactive [[telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s remain on human chromosome 2 as a result of the fusion.&lt;ref name="pbslearningmedia-2007-human-chromosome-2" /&gt; The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of [[DNA sequencing]] methods. If true, human [[DNA]] should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other [[mammal]]s. If not, then common descent is falsified. DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html|title=Chimps are human, gene study implies|last=Hecht|first=Jeff|date=May 19, 2003|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|location=London|issn=0262-4079}}

Numerous [[transitional fossil]]s have since been found.&lt;ref name="talkorigins-faqs-foley" /&gt; Hence, human evolution has passed several falsifiable tests.

Many of Darwin's ideas and assertions of fact have been falsified as evolutionary science has developed, but these amendments and falsifications have uniformly confirmed his central concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html|title=Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean?|last=Wilkins|first=John S.|year=1997|work=Evolution and Philosophy|publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc.|location=Houston, TX|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wasdarwinwrong.com/kortho13.htm#Wrong|title=In What Way Was Darwin Wrong?|last=Korthof|first=Gert|authorlink=Gert Korthof|website=Towards The Third Evolutionary Synthesis|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, creationist explanations involving the direct intervention of the supernatural in the physical world are not falsifiable, because any result of an experiment or investigation could be the unpredictable action of an omnipotent deity.&lt;ref name="Expelled Exposed: Science &amp; Religion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expelledexposed.com/the-truth/evolution|title=Why Expelled Flunks » Science &amp; Religion|website=Expelled Exposed|publisher=National Center for Science Education|location=Oakland, CA|accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that "Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed his mind and argued that Darwin's "theory of natural selection is difficult to test" with respect to other areas of science.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |date=December 1978 |title=Natural Selection and the Emergence of Mind |journal=Dialectica |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishers]] |volume=32 |issue=3–4 |pages=339–355 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1978.tb01321.x |issn=1746-8361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=John R. |date=Fall 1981 |title=Misquoted Scientists Respond |url=http://ncse.com/cej/2/4/misquoted-scientists-respond |journal=Creation/Evolution |location=Buffalo, NY |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=2 |issue=4 |accessdate=2015-03-29}} Quoting Popper: "I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1982 book, ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Philip Kitcher]] specifically addresses the "falsifiability" question by taking into account notable philosophical critiques of Popper by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and provides a definition of theory other than as a set of falsifiable statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hempel|1965|}}
* {{harvnb|Quine|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of "theory," observations of [[Uranus]] when it was first discovered in 1781 would have "falsified" [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[celestial mechanics]]. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed. Kitcher agrees with Popper that "there is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|1982|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he insists that we view scientific theories as consisting of an "elaborate collection of statements," some of which are not falsifiable, and others—what he calls "auxiliary hypotheses," which are.

=== Tautological nature ===
A related claim to the supposed unfalsifiability of evolution is that natural selection is [[tautology (logic)|tautological]].&lt;ref name="popper" /&gt; Specifically, it is often argued that the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" is a tautology, in that [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is defined as ability to survive and reproduce.  This phrase was first used by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864 but is rarely used by biologists. Additionally, fitness is more accurately defined as the state of possessing traits that make survival more likely; this definition, unlike simple "survivability," avoids being trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology_org_ver.html |title=A Good Tautology is Hard to Find |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |year=1997 |work=Evolution and Philosophy |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-30}} Original version. Updated version [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Survival of the fittest]] for a more thorough discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is argued that evolutionary theory is [[circular reasoning]], in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological [[stratum|strata]] are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in.&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt; However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by [[radiometric dating]], and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html |title=Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools? |last=MacRae |first=Andrew |date=October 2, 1998 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

Objections to the evidence that evolution occurs tend to be more concrete and specific, often involving direct analysis of evolutionary biology's methods and claims.

===Lack of observation===
[[File:Archaeopteryx-model.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Transitional fossil|Transitional species]] such as the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have been a fixture of the [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution debate]] for almost 150 years.]]

A common claim of creationists is that evolution has never been observed.&lt;ref name="hovinddvd"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Kent Hovind]] (Presenter) |year=2002 |origyear=Original series published 1998 |title=The Dangers of Evolution |medium=DVD |location=Pensacola, FL |publisher=[[Kent Hovind#Creation Science Evangelism and Creation Today|Creation Science Evangelism]] |id=Creation Seminar Series, part 5 |oclc=57301209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the [[#Defining evolution|Defining evolution]] section above). Under the conventional biological definition of ''evolution'', it is a simple matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], [[Mouse|mice]], and [[bacteria]] in the laboratory,&lt;ref name="Buckling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckling |first1=Angus |last2=Maclean |first2=R.

In response to such examples, creationists say there are two major subdivisions of evolution to be considered, [[microevolution]] and [[macroevolution]], and it is questionable if macro-evolution has been physically observed to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbsef.org/FAQ.htm#Is%20TBSEF%20against%20teaching%20evolution? |title=Questions frequently asked about the TBSEF: Is TBSEF against teaching evolution? |website=Texans for Better Science Education Foundation |location=Spring, TX |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo10.html |title=Kansas Evolution Hearings: Part 10 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |type=Transcript |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in [[dog breeding]]. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes over long periods of time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.

As biologists define ''macroevolution'', both microevolution and macroevolution have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB901.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CB901: No Macroevolution |date=April 16, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-31 |quote=As biologists use the term, macroevolution means evolution at or above the species level.

Additionally, past macroevolution can be inferred from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' linking [[bird]]s and non-avian [[dinosaur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=Gerald |authorlink1=Gerald Mayr |last2=Pohl |first2=Burkhard |last3=Peters |first3=D.

Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species to be one of the greatest weaknesses of his theory: &lt;blockquote&gt;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain  and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the [[Silurian]] period. In later editions he added "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=298 280–313]}}

As more and more compelling direct evidence for inter-species and species-to-species evolution has been gathered, creationists have redefined their understanding of what amounts to "[[Baraminology|created kinds]]," and have continued to insist that more dramatic demonstrations of evolution be experimentally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wieland |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Wieland |date=April 1991 |title=Variation, information and the created kind |url=http://creation.com/variation-information-and-the-created-kind |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=42–47 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this objection is "Were you there?," popularized by [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Ken Ham]]. It argues that because no one except God could directly observe events in the distant past, scientific claims are just speculation or "story-telling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Ham |year=1989 |title=Were You There? |url=http://www.icr.org/article/670/88/ |journal=Acts &amp; Facts |location=El Cajon, CA |publisher=Institute for Creation Research |volume=18 |issue=10 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2004-5-10-isaak /&gt; DNA sequences of the [[genome]]s of organisms allow an independent test of their predicted relationships, since species which diverged more recently will be more closely related genetically than species which are more distantly related; such [[phylogenetic tree]]s show a hierarchical organization within the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], as predicted by common descent.&lt;ref name=aaas-1997-4-11-huelsenbeck-rannala /&gt;&lt;ref name=naturepublishing-2005-5-delsuc-brinkman-philippe /&gt;

In fields such as [[astrophysics]] or [[meteorology]], where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravitation]] was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name="Ein1916"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |year=1916 |title=Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie |trans-title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |format=PDF |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |language=de |volume='''354''' [49] |issue=7 |pages=769–822 |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2006-08-29 |issn=0003-3804 |accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable evidence===
A related objection is that evolution is based on unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution is likely to be overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.

Arguments against evolution's reliability are thus often based on analyzing the [[history of evolutionary thought]] or the [[history of science]] in general. Creationists point out that in the past, major [[paradigm shift|scientific revolutions]] have overturned theories that were at the time considered near-certain. They thus claim that current evolutionary theory is likely to undergo such a revolution in the future, on the basis that it is a "theory in crisis" for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA110.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA110: Evolution will soon be widely rejected |year=2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[George Romanes]]' 1892 copy of Ernst Haeckel's [[embryo drawings]], often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Michael K. |last2=Keuck |first2=Gerhard |date=November 2002 |title=Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development |journal=Biological Reviews |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] on behalf of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]] |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=495–528 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102005948 |issn=1464-7931 |pmid=12475051}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Critics of evolution commonly appeal to past scientific [[hoax]]es such as the [[Piltdown Man]] [[archaeological forgery|forgery]]. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects of evolution, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution has been accused of being fraudulent at various times, including ''Archaeopteryx'', [[peppered moth evolution|peppered moth melanism]], and [[Darwin's finches]]; these claims have been subsequently refuted.&lt;ref name=archaeopteryx-1986-charig-greenaway-milner-walker-whybrow /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1997-12-15-nedin /&gt;&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-faqs-wells /&gt;

It has also been claimed that certain former pieces of evidence for evolution which are now considered out-of-date and erroneous, such as [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s 19th-century comparative drawings of embryos, used to illustrate his [[recapitulation theory]] (''"[[ontogeny]] recapitulates [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]"''), were not merely errors but frauds.&lt;ref name="CB701"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB701.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CB701: Haeckel's embryo pictures |date=June 5, 2005 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologist]] [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]]  criticizes biology [[textbook]]s by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence after it has been debunked.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; In response, the [[National Center for Science Education]] notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells makes the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion about why they are wrong, and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.&lt;ref name="Icon4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/icon-4-haeckels-embryos |title=Icon 4 — Haeckel's Embryos |last=Gishlick |first=Alan D. |date=November 23, 2006 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable chronology===

Creationists claim that evolution relies on certain types of evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, it is argued that [[radiometric dating]] technique of evaluating a material's age based on the [[radioactive decay]] rates of certain [[isotope]]s generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. [[Radiocarbon dating]] based on the [[carbon-14]] isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as [[closed system]]s. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD010.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CD010: Radiometric Dating |year=2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of this objection is that fossil evidence is not reliable. This is based on a much wider range of claims. These include that there are too many "gaps" in the fossil record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC200: Transitional fossils |date=November 5, 2006 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200_1.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC200.1: Transitional fossil abundance |date=January 29, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fossil-dating is circular (see the [[#Evolution is unfalsifiable|Unfalsifiability]] section above), or that certain fossils, such as [[polystrate fossil]]s, are seemingly "out of place." Examination by geologists have found polystrate fossils to be consistent with ''in situ'' formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC340.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC340: Out-of-place fossils |date=March 22, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that certain features of evolution support creationism's [[catastrophism]] (cf. [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]]), rather than evolution's [[gradualism|gradualistic]] [[punctuated equilibrium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC363.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC363: Requirements for fossilization |date=July 23, 2003 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some assert is an ''ad hoc'' theory to explain the fossil gaps.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2004-3-17-isaak /&gt;

==Plausibility==
Some of the oldest and most common objections to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued{{by whom|date=December 2016}} that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the [[Abrahamic religions]], must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Improbability===
{{further|Teleological argument|Watchmaker analogy|Evolutionary argument against naturalism|Haldane's dilemma}}
A common objection to evolution is that it is simply too unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent "design," to have arisen "by chance." It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable ''not'' to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batten |first=Don |date=March 1995 |title=Cheating with chance |url=http://creation.com/cheating-with-chance |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=14–15 |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the [[#Creation of complex structures|Creation of complex structures]] section below). The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]"—a claim attributed to [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]] and known as [[Junkyard tornado|Hoyle's fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 137–138]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoyle was a Darwinist, [[Atheism|atheist]] and [[Antitheism|anti-theist]], but advocated the theory of [[panspermia]], in which abiogenesis begins in [[outer space]] and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.

Views superficially similar, but unrelated to Hoyle's, are thus invariably justified with arguments from analogy. The basic idea of this argument for a designer is the [[teleological argument]], an argument for the [[existence of God]] based on the perceived order or purposefulness of the [[universe]]. A common way of using this as an objection to evolution is by appealing to the 18th-century philosopher William Paley's watchmaker analogy, which argues that certain natural phenomena are analogical to a watch (in that they are ordered, or complex, or purposeful), which means that, like a watch, they must have been designed by a "watchmaker"—an intelligent agent. This argument forms the core of intelligent design, a neo-creationist movement seeking to establish certain variants of the design argument as legitimate science, rather than as philosophy or [[theology]], and have them be taught alongside evolution.&lt;ref name="SM07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;
[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|frame|left|Because the theory of evolution is often thought of as the idea that life arose "by chance," [[teleological argument|design arguments]] such as [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]] of 1802 have long been popular objections to the theory:&lt;ref name="chance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/chance/chance.html |title=Evolution and Chance |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |date=April 17, 1997 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-04-02}} Version 2.1 Draft 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Paley's book included a response to the proto-evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]].]]
This objection is fundamentally an [[argument from ignorance|argument by lack of imagination]], or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being [[counterintuitive]], and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution is not based on "chance," but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the "designer." Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem "designed" is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. [[Snow#Snowflakes|snowflakes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI100.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CI100: Intelligent Design |date=April 3, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate [[argument from poor design|poor design]], and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chance" /&gt;

It has also been noted that arguments against some form of life arising "by chance" are really objections to nontheistic abiogenesis, not to evolution. Indeed, arguments against "evolution" are based on the misconception that abiogenesis is a component of, or necessary precursor to, evolution. Similar objections sometimes conflate the Big Bang with evolution.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

[[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] and philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], a supporter of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God would be expected to create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel [[epistemology|epistemological]] argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, is more likely to be selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitelson |first1=Branden |last2=Sober |first2=Elliott |authorlink2=Elliott Sober |date=June 1998 |title=Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism |url=http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Pacific Philosophical Quarterly]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the School of Philosophy ([[University of Southern California]]) |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=115–129 |doi=10.1111/1468-0114.00053 |issn=0279-0750 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA120: Mind's fallibility |date=September 1, 2003 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related argument against evolution is that most mutations are harmful.&lt;ref name="CB101"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB101.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CB101: Most mutations harmful? |date=June 20, 2008 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of mutations are [[neutral mutation|neutral]], and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mutations.html |title=Are Mutations Harmful? |last=Harter |first=Richard |date=May 23, 1999 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are [[consciousness]], [[Evolution of human intelligence|hominid intelligence]], [[instinct]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[metamorphosis]], [[photosynthesis]], [[homosexuality]], [[music]], [[language]], religion, morality, and [[altruism]] (see [[Altruism (biology)|altruism in animals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E.

Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation has been able to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-9-17-isaak /&gt;

Creationists argue against evolution on the grounds that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the [[meaning of life]]. In such instances, ''evolution'' is being [[#Defining evolution|redefined]] to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE440.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CE440: The origin of it all |date=September 25, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impossibility==
This class of objections is more radical than the above, claiming that a major aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in such a way that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.

{{further|Irreducible complexity}}
[[File:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|thumb|The [[Flagellum#Bacterial|bacterial flagellum]] has been invoked in [[creation science]] and in [[intelligent design]] to illustrate the concept of [[irreducible complexity]]. Careful analysis shows that there are no major obstacles to a gradual [[evolution of flagella]].]]

Modern evolutionary theory posits that all biological systems must have evolved incrementally, through a combination of natural selection and [[genetic drift]]. Both Darwin and his early detractors recognized the potential problems that could arise for his theory of natural selection if the lineage of organs and other biological features could not be accounted for by gradual, step-by-step changes over successive generations; if all the intermediary stages between an initial organ and the organ it will become are not all improvements upon the original, it will be impossible for the later organ to develop by the process of natural selection alone. Complex organs such as the eye had been presented by William Paley as exemplifying the need for [[teleological argument|design by God]], and anticipating early criticisms that the [[evolution of the eye]] and other complex organs seemed impossible, Darwin noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[R]eason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Ethology|ethologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] said on the topic of the evolution of the [[feather]] in an interview for the television program ''[[The Atheism Tapes]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's got to be a series of advantages all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On this basis, Behe argues that such structures were "purposely arranged by an intelligent agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Behe |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Behe |date=October 29, 1996 |title=Darwin Under the Microscope |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_dm11496.htm |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=25 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreducible complexity is the idea that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the [[coagulation#The coagulation cascade|blood clotting cascade]], the [[immune system]], and the [[Flagellum#Bacterial|bacterial flagellum]] are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Behe|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Intelligent design falsification}}{{Quote|In fact, ''my argument for intelligent design is open to direct experimental rebuttal''. Here is a thought experiment that makes the point clear. In ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' (Behe 1996) I claimed that the bacterial flagellum was irreducibly complex and so required deliberate intelligent design. The flip side of this claim is that the flagellum can't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation, or any other unintelligent process. To falsify such a claim, a scientist could go into the laboratory, place a bacterial species lacking a flagellum under some selective pressure (for mobility, say), grow it for ten thousand generations, and see if a flagellum--or any equally complex system--was produced.

===Creation of information===
{{further|Physical information|Biosemiotics}}
A recent objection of creationists to evolution is that evolutionary mechanisms such as [[mutation]] cannot generate new [[physical information|information]]. Creationists such as [[William A. Dembski]], [[Werner Gitt]], and [[Lee Spetner]] have attempted to use [[information theory]] to dispute evolution. Dembski has argued that life demonstrates [[specified complexity]], and proposed a law of conservation of information that extremely improbable "complex specified information" could be conveyed by natural means but never originated without an [[intelligent designer|intelligent agent]].  Gitt asserted that information is an intrinsic characteristic of life and that an analysis demonstrates the mind and will of their Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gitt |first=Werner |authorlink=Werner Gitt |date=August 1996 |title=Information, Science and Biology |url=http://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j10_2/j10_2_181-187.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=181–187 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims have been widely rejected by the scientific community which asserts that new information is regularly generated in evolution whenever a novel mutation or [[gene duplication]] arises. Dramatic examples of entirely new and unique traits arising through mutation have been observed in recent years, such as the evolution of [[nylon-eating bacteria]] which developed new [[enzyme]]s to efficiently digest a material that never existed before the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/infotheory.html |title=Information Theory and Creationism |last1=Musgrave |first1=Ian |last2=Baldwin |first2=Rich |year=2005 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm |title=Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug |last=Thomas |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Thomas (skeptic) |publisher=[[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]] |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no need to account for the creation of information when an organism is considered together with the environment it evolved in. The information in the genome forms a record of how it was possible to survive in a particular environment. The information is gathered from the environment through [[trial and error]] as mutating organisms either reproduce or fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Bergstrom |first1=Carl T. |authorlink=Carl Bergstrom |last2=Lachmann |first2=Michael |title=The fitness value of information |year=2006 |eprint=q-bio.PE/0510007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violation of the second law of thermodynamics===
{{further|Entropy and life}}
[[File:Photosynthesis.gif|thumb|200px|right|Since [[Earth]] receives energy from the [[Sun]], it is an open system. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] applies only to isolated systems.]]

Another objection is that evolution violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974|p=45}}: "Until evolutionists can not only speculate, but demonstrate, that there does exist in nature some vast program to direct the growth toward higher complexity of the marvelous organic space-time unity known as the terrestrial biosphere (not to mention that of the cosmos), as well as some remarkable global power converter to energize the growth through converted solar energy, the whole evolutionary idea is negated by the Second Law."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1984|pp=99–116}}: "Henry Morris, director of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) has joined several other engineers to make thermodynamics a cornerstone of the creation-evolution controversy. For twenty years Morris has maintained that the second law of thermodynamics directly contradicts evolution. ... Is there, indeed, a paradox at all? The answer to this question is, quite simply - no! Morris and his colleagues have constructed a completely fallacious and deceptive argument."&lt;/ref&gt; The law states that "the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium". In other words, an isolated system's [[entropy]] (a measure of the dispersal of energy in a physical system so that it is not available to do mechanical work) will tend to increase or stay the same, not decrease. Creationists argue that evolution violates this physical law by requiring a decrease in entropy, or disorder, over time.&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=aig-thermodynamics-evolution /&gt;

The claims have been criticized for ignoring that the second law only applies to [[isolated system]]s. Organisms are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of [[self-organization|self-organizing]] life.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-10-1-faq-misconceptions-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.gmu.edu/~roerter/EvolutionEntropy.htm |title=Does Life On Earth Violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics? |last=Oerter |first=Robert N. |year=2006 |publisher=[[George Mason University]] |location=Fairfax, VA |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncse-creationism-laws-thermodynamics /&gt;

In a published letter to the editor of ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' titled "How anti-evolutionists abuse mathematics," [[mathematician]] [[Jason Rosenhouse]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact is that natural forces routinely lead to local decreases in entropy. Water freezes into ice and fertilised eggs turn into babies.

==Moral implications==
Other common objections to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It is argued that the teaching of evolution degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters [[irreligion]] or [[atheism]]. These may be considered [[appeal to consequences|appeals to consequences]] (a form of [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]]), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory have nothing to do with its objective empirical reality.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] humans are animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Morris |authorlink1=Morris Goodman |last2=Tagle |first2=Danilo A. |last3=Fitch |first3=David H.

Aristotle already described man as a political animal&lt;ref&gt;Politics, 1253a&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] defined man as a rational animal,&lt;ref&gt;Isagoge&lt;/ref&gt; a definition accepted by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophers]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in ''[[Creation Ministries International|Creation]]'' magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rendle-Short |first=Tyndale John |date=February 1980 |title=What should a Christian think about evolution? |url=http://creation.com/what-should-a-christian-think-about-evolution |journal=Ex Nihilo |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |accessdate=2015-04-07 |quote=9. Evolution lowers man from the 'image of God' to the level of an animal. Why then should he not behave as one, in his own life and towards others?}}&lt;/ref&gt; since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet [[Norm (social)|social standards]], so humans behave in the manner of other humans.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-4-2-isaak /&gt;

[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|200px| [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s book ''[[Man's Place in Nature]]'' (1863) was the first devoted to [[human evolution]] and an early example of [[comparative biology]].]]
In 1917, [[Vernon Kellogg]] published ''Headquarters Nights: A Record of Conversations and Experiences at the Headquarters of the German Army in France and Belgium'', which asserted that German intellectuals were totally committed to might-makes-right due to "whole-hearted acceptance of the worst of Neo-Darwinism, the ''Allmacht'' of natural selection applied rigorously to human life and society and ''Kultur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellogg|1917|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=RhIjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3AHeadquarters+intitle%3ANights+inauthor%3AVernon+inauthor%3AKellogg&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;q=flussen#PPA22,M1 22–31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strongly influenced the politician [[William Jennings Bryan]], who saw Darwinism as a moral threat to America and campaigned against evolutionary theory; his campaign culminated in the [[Scopes Trial]], which effectively prevented teaching of evolution in most public schools until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=pbs-evolution-library-scopes-trial /&gt;

[[Albert Mohler|R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Louisville, Kentucky, wrote August 8, 2005, in [[NPR]]'s ''Taking Issue'' essay series, that "Debates over education, abortion, environmentalism, homosexuality and a host of other issues are really debates about the origin — and thus the meaning — of human life. ...evolutionary theory stands at the base of [[moral relativism]] and the rejection of traditional morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mohler |first=R.

[[Henry M. Morris]], engineering professor and founder of the [[Creation Research Society]] and the [[Institute of Creation Research]], claims that evolution was part of a [[paganism|pagan]] religion that emerged after the [[Tower of Babel]], was part of [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s philosophies, and was responsible for everything from war to pornography to the breakup of the nuclear family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also claimed that perceived social ills like [[crime]], [[Teenage pregnancy|teenage pregnancies]], [[homosexuality]], [[abortion]], [[immorality]], [[war]]s, and [[genocide]] are caused by a belief in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. [[D. James Kennedy]] of The Center for Reclaiming America for Christ and Coral Ridge Ministries claims that Darwin was responsible for [[Adolf Hitler]]'s atrocities. In Kennedy's documentary and the accompanying pamphlet with the same title, ''Darwin's Deadly Legacy'', Kennedy states that "To put it simply, no Darwin, no Hitler." In his efforts to expose the "harmful effects that evolution is still having on our nation, our children, and our world," Kennedy also states that, "We have had 150 years of the theory of Darwinian evolution, and what has it brought us? Whether Darwin intended it or not, millions of deaths, the destruction of those deemed inferior, the devaluing of human life, increasing hopelessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/kennedy-evolution-blame-death-hopelessness-world |title=Kennedy: Evolution to Blame for Death, Hopelessness in World |date=August 17, 2006 |website=Right Wing Watch |publisher=[[People for the American Way]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agape_press"&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Allie |last2=Parker |first2=Jenni |date=August 25, 2006 |title=TV Producer Defends Documentary Exposing Darwin-Hitler Link |url=http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/252006b.asp |agency=Agape Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830014156/http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/252006b.asp |archivedate=2006-08-30 |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADLBlasts"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=ADL Blasts Christian Supremacist TV Special &amp; Book Blaming Darwin For Hitler |url=http://archive.adl.org/nr/exeres/3e0340d2-b672-45c7-8ff1-10c9eed96f42,0b1623ca-d5a4-465d-a369-df6e8679cd9e,frameless.html |location=New York |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |date=August 22, 2006 |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Discovery Institute's [[Center for Science and Culture]] fellow [[Richard Weikart]] has made similar claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weikart|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Witt |first=Jonathan |date=December 15, 2006 |title=From Darwin to Hitler: A Pathway to Horror (Updated) |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/from_darwin_to_hitler_a_straig.html |work=Evolution News and Views |location=Seattle, WA |publisher=Discovery Institute |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have other creationists.&lt;ref name=creation-1999-8-bergman /&gt; The claim was central to the documentary film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' (2008) promoting intelligent design creationism. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] describes such claims as outrageous misuse of [[the Holocaust]] and its imagery, and as trivializing the "...many complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry. Hitler did not need Darwin or evolution to devise his heinous plan to exterminate the Jewish people, and Darwin and evolutionary theory cannot explain Hitler's genocidal madness. Moreover, [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] existed long before Darwin ever wrote a word."&lt;ref name="ADLBlasts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=adl-2008-4-29-misappropriation /&gt;

Young Earth creationist [[Kent Hovind]] blames [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[racism]], the Holocaust, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s war crimes, the [[Vietnam War]], and [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Killing Fields]] on evolution, as well as the increase in crime, unwed mothers, and other social ills.&lt;ref name="hovinddvd" /&gt; Hovind's son Eric Hovind claims that evolution is responsible for tattoos, body piercing, premarital sex, unwed births, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), divorce, and child abuse.&lt;ref name=dakotavoice-2006-5-7-ellis /&gt;

Supporters of evolution dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and some argue that the opposite seems to be the case. A study published by the author and illustrator [[Gregory S. Paul]] found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime.&lt;ref name=creighton-2005-paul /&gt; [[The Barna Group]] surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among [[Baptists]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.&lt;ref name=barna-2004-09-08 /&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]] argued in ''Scientific American'' in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=michaelshermer-2006-10-shermer /&gt; He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect.&lt;ref name=tallahassee-2008-2-6-ruse /&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}} Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust are more likely to be found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2007-3-13-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkreason-2007-08-24-avalos /&gt;

Evolution has been used to justify [[Social Darwinism]], the exploitation of so-called "lesser breeds without the law" by "superior races," particularly in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt; Typically strong European nations that had successfully expanded their empires could be said to have "survived" in the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt; With this attitude, Europeans except for  [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]] rarely adopted any customs and languages of local people under their empires.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt;

===Atheism===
{{further|Atheism}}
Another charge leveled at evolutionary theory by creationists is that belief in evolution is either tantamount to atheism, or conducive to atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strobel|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TV6pTalyyx8C&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 32]}}: "In my quest to determine if contemporary science points toward or away from God, I knew I had to first examine the claims of evolution in order to conclude once and for all whether Darwinism creates a reasonable foundation for atheism. That's because if the materialism of Darwinian evolution is a fact, then the atheist conclusions I reached as a student might still be valid."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arn-johnson /&gt; It is commonly claimed that all proponents of evolutionary theory are "materialistic atheists." On the other hand, Davis A. Young argues that creation science ''itself'' is harmful to Christianity because its bad science will turn more away than it recruits. Young asks, "Can we seriously expect non-Christians to develop a respect for Christianity if we insist on teaching the brand of science that creationism brings with it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evolution neither requires nor rules out the existence of a supernatural being. Philosopher [[Robert T. Pennock]] makes the comparison that evolution is no more atheistic than [[plumbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennock|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Allen Orr]], professor of biology at [[University of Rochester]], notes that:

{{quote|
Of the five founding fathers of twentieth-century evolutionary biology—[[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]], [[Ernst Mayr]], and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]—one was a devout Anglican who preached sermons and published articles in church magazines, one a practicing Unitarian, one a dabbler in Eastern mysticism, one an apparent atheist, and one a member of the Russian Orthodox Church and the author of a book on religion and science.&lt;ref name=thenewyorker-orr /&gt; }}

In addition, a wide range of religions have reconciled a belief in a supernatural being with evolution.&lt;ref name=ncse-religiousorganizations /&gt; Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science Education found that "of Americans in the twelve largest Christian denominations, 89.6% belong to churches that support evolution education." These churches include the "[[United Methodist Church]], [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention USA]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] (USA), [[National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.|National Baptist Convention of America]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and others."&lt;ref name=thewitchitaeagle-schrock /&gt; A poll in 2000 done for [[People for the American Way]] found that 70% of the American public felt that evolution was compatible with a belief in God. Only 48% of the people polled could choose the correct definition of evolution from a list, however.&lt;ref name=pfaw-public-education /&gt;

One poll reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution).&lt;ref name=naturepublishing-larson /&gt; This is similar to the results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers [[prayer]]s, and believe in [[immortality]].&lt;ref name=ncse-witham /&gt; While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, [[Agnosticism|agnostic]]s, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Poll]] of the American public and scientists.&lt;ref name=religioustolerance-robinson /&gt;

Traditionalists still object to the idea that diversity in life, including human beings, arose through natural processes without a need for supernatural intervention, and they argue against evolution on the basis that it contradicts their literal interpretation of [[creation myth]]s about separate "[[Baraminology|created kinds]]." However, many religions, such as [[Catholicism]], have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through theistic evolution.&lt;ref name=caltech-1996-10-30-pope-john-paul-ii /&gt;&lt;ref name=ekklesia /&gt;

Thus the power of the creationist argument: evolution is 'only' a theory and intense debate now rages about many aspects of the theory. If evolution is worse than a fact, and scientists can't even make up their minds about the theory, then what confidence can we have in it? [...] Well evolution ''is'' a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty.}} — Moran quoting [[Stephen J. Gould]] (''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'', May 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the popular mind, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation by the 'superior races' of 'lesser breeds without the law.' This language of race and conflict, of superior and inferior people, had wide currency in the Western nations. Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not. To these elitists, all white peoples were more fit than nonwhites to prevail in the struggle for dominance. Even among Europeans, some nations were deemed more fit than others for the competition. Usually, Social Darwinists thought their own nation the best, an attitude that sparked their competitive enthusiasm. ...In the nineteenth century, in contrast to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europeans, except for missionaries, rarely adopted the customs or learned the languages of local people. They had little sense that other cultures and other peoples deserved respect. Many Westerners believed that it was their Christian duty to set an example and to educate others. Missionaries were the first to meet and learn about many peoples and the first to develop writing for those without a written language. Christian missionaries were ardently opposed to slavery...."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Igreja de Campanha Azulejo 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tile|Tilings]], such as these from [[:pt:Igreja de Campanhã|Igreja de Campanhã]], Porto, [[Portugal]], are visual patterns used for decoration.]]

A '''pattern''' is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]]s and typically repeated like a [[wallpaper]] design.

Any of the [[sense]]s may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in [[science]], [[mathematics]], or [[language]] may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual [[patterns in nature]] are often [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], never exactly repeating, and often involve [[fractals]]. Natural patterns include [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]], and those created by [[Symmetry|symmetries]] of [[rotation symmetry|rotation]] and [[reflection symmetry|reflection]]. Patterns have an underlying [[Mathematics|mathematical]] structure;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a [[software design pattern]] is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]] used to create any number of similar garments.

== Nature ==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including [[symmetry|symmetries]], trees and other structures with a [[fractal]] dimension, [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. ''Patterns in Nature'', 1974. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symmetry ===

[[File:Schnee1.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Snowflake]] [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]]]

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]] as this favours movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], including [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal]]s have a highly specific set of possible [[crystal habit|crystal symmetries]]; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===

[[File:Aloe polyphylla spiral.jpg|thumb|75px|''[[Aloe polyphylla]]'' [[phyllotaxis]]]]

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including [[molluscs]] such as the [[nautilus]], and in the [[phyllotaxis]] of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the [[sunflower]] and fruit structures like the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | year=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===
[[File:Vortex-street-1-90deg.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Vortex street]] turbulence]]

[[Chaos theory]] predicts that while the laws of [[physics]] are [[deterministic]], events and patterns in nature never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chaos |author1=Crutchfield, James P |author2=Farmer, J Doyne, |author3=Packard, Norman H |author4=Shaw, Robert S | journal=Scientific American |date=December 1986 | volume=254 | issue=12 | pages=46–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including [[vortex street]]s&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{ISBN|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{ISBN|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other effects of turbulent flow such as [[meander]]s in rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | year=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waves, dunes ===
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Dune]] [[Capillary wave|ripple]]]]

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are [[surface wave]]s that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of [[dune]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | year=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Bubbles, foam ===

[[File:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Foam]] of [[soap bubble]]s]]

[[Foam]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]]. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, and the skeletons of [[silicoflagellate]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball. ''Shapes'', 2009. pp 68, 96-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cracks ===
[[File:Cracked earth in the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|75px|Shrinkage [[Fracture|Cracks]]]]

[[Fracture|Crack]]s form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. 1974. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shapes''. 2009. Pages 159–167.&lt;/ref&gt; These  [[spatiotemporal pattern]]s slowly drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.

=== Tilings ===
{{further|Tessellation|Tile}}

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[tapestry]], ceramic [[Tile|tiling]] or [[carpet]], but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/pattern/pattern.htm | title=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking | publisher=Cornell University | work=Pattern | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Jirousek, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, a [[tessellation]] is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|author2=Shephard, G. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In architecture===
[[Image:Hampi1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a [[fractal]]-like structure where the parts resemble the whole.]]
{{main|Pattern (architecture)|Mathematics and architecture}}

In architecture, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as [[column]]s, [[pediment]]s, and [[lintel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Western Art | publisher=McGraw Hill | author=Adams, Laurie | year=2001 | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a [[fractal]]-like way at different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Heaven's Fractal Net: Retrieving Lost Visions in the Humanities | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Jackson, William Joseph | year=2004 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematics]] is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2214851?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101539380483 | title=Mathematics as a Science of Patterns: Ontology and Reference | author=Resnik, Michael D. | journal=Noûs |date=November 1981 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=529–550 | doi=10.2307/2214851}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[sequence]] of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coas.howard.edu/mathematics/faculty/bayne/patterns.html | title=MATH 012 Patterns in Mathematics - spring 2012 | year=2012 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | author=Bayne, Richard E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain [[patterns in nature]] including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. [[Fractal]]s are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. [[Self-similarity]] is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their [[pattern formation|formation]] can be simple (e.g. [[Lindenmayer system]]s describing [[tree]] shapes).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |authorlink=Benoît Mandelbrot |title=The fractal geometry of nature
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983| publisher=Macmillan
|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pattern theory]], devised by [[Ulf Grenander]], mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Grenander, Ulf |author2=Miller, Michael | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smg/Website/UCP/ | title=Causal Patterns in Science | publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education | year=2008 | accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer science ==

In computer science, a [[software design pattern]], in the sense of a [[Template method pattern|template]], is a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gamma et al, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
{{main|Pattern (sewing)}}
In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]], a technical two-dimensional tool used to create any number of identical garments. It can be considered as a means of translating from the drawing to the real garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Artist Centric Marketplace for Fashion Sketch Templates, Croquis &amp; More|url=https://illustratorstuff.com/|publisher=Illustrator Stuff|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quino checkerspot''' (''Euphydryas editha quino'') is a [[butterfly]] native to southern [[California]] and northwestern [[Mexico]]. It is a [[subspecies]] of the common [[Edith's checkerspot]] (''Euphydryas editha'') and the second such subspecies to be listed under the federal [[Endangered Species Act]]. This species, like many others, has undergone several changes in nomenclature and classification. It was originally described as ''Melitaea quino'' in 1863 and then in 1929 it was reduced to a subspecies of ''Euphydryas chalcedona''. In 1998 it was concluded through [[Hans Hermann Behr]]'s 1863 description that it should be classified as ''E. editha'', not ''E. chalcedona''. The species was synonymous with ''E. editha wrighti'', a junior [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] for ''E. e. quino'', thus becoming scientifically accepted as ''E. editha quino''.&lt;ref name="FWS"&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plans/2003/030917.pdf Quino checkerspot Recovery Plan], ([[PDF]]), 191 pages, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Appearance===
A member of the brush-footed butterfly family, [[Nymphalidae]], the Quino checkerspot is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;cm. The dorsal wing surfaces are a colorful checkerboard of brown, red and yellow spots. The Quino differs from other ''E. editha'' subspecies in that its spots tend to be a darker red.&lt;ref name="BCI"&gt;[http://www.butterflyrecovery.org/species_profiles/quino_checkerspot/ Quino Checkerspot butterfly], Butterfly Conservation Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

It also differentiates itself through its size and [[larva]]l and [[pupa]]l [[phenotype]]s. The [[ventral]] side of the butterfly are dominated by a checkered red and cream pattern. Its [[abdomen]] has red stripes across the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side. After a second [[ecdysis|molt]], the Quino checkerspot is recognized by the dark black coloration and row of 8 to 9 orange tubercles on their back. Before the larvae first molt they are mostly yellowish. After first molt and before their second molt they are gray with black markings. The pupae are mottled black on a blue-gray background.

The Quino checkerspot is easily confused in the field by inexperienced butterfly searchers. It is generally confused with three other co-occurring butterfly species, the Chalcedon or variable checkerspot, (''[[Euphydryas chalcedona]]''), Gabb's checkerspot (''[[Chlosyne gabbii]]'') and Wright's checkerspot (''[[Thessalia leonira wrighti]]'').&lt;ref name="FWS"/&gt;

===Life cycle===
The life cycle of the Quino checkerspot closely mirrors that of the close [[Bay checkerspot]]. They share the same host plant and similar chronology of developmental stages.

==Habitat==
The obvious factor in the decline of the Quino checkerspot is [[urban development]]. Much of the historic [[Shrubland|scrub land]] that it occupied, much like the [[Mission blue butterfly]], also endangered, has been built over. The persisting [[habitat]] faces other threats. [[Invasive species]], in the form of non-native plant life and overgrazing are just two of the hurdles facing the recovery of the Quino checkerspot. Today, there are eight populations of the Quino known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://essig.berkeley.edu/endins/quino.htm Quino Checkerspot Butterfly], Essig Museum of Entomology, UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
Habitat declined and, thus, distribution and population of the Quino checkerspot has been greatly reduced during the last 100 years. Nearly all of the blame lies in [[agricultural]] and urban development in southern California. The other impactors to the decline include non-native grasses and fire suppression practices as well as [[grazing]]. The Quino checkerspot became the second subspecies of ''Euphydryas editha'' to be listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The first was the [[Bay checkerspot]].&lt;ref name="BCI"/&gt;

Currently, the Quino checkerspot is only found in a very few locales. Western [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], southern [[San Diego County]] and northern [[Baja California]], Mexico. The animal's historic range once included much of coastal California south of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] as well as the inland valleys south of the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. Regardless, more than 75% of the butterfly's original range has been lost. The range loss translates directly into population decline. Quino checkerspot butterfly populations appear to have decreased by more than 95% range wide.&lt;ref name="FWS"/&gt;

'''Rationality''' is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rationality|title=Definition of RATIONALITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational|title=Definition of RATIONAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s to believe, and of one's actions with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s for action. "Rationality" has different specialized meanings in [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason|title=reason|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[game theory]] and [[political science]].

To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a logical formulation of the problem. When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the model within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.

==Theories==

===Max Weber===
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality. The first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were "rationally pursued and calculated." The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motive, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered "meaningfully oriented." The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that a ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.

Weber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&amp;nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, M. (ed) (2003) ''A Concise Companion to Feminist Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative position on rationality (which includes both [[bounded rationality]],&lt;ref&gt;Simons, H. and Hawkins, D. (1949), "Some Conditions in Macro-Economic Stability", ''Econometrica'', 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (1988), [https://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/etzioni/A186.pdf "Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model"], ''Journal of Economic Psychology'', Vol. 9, pp. 125–150.&lt;/ref&gt; who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Psychology===
In the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&amp;nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. &amp; Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2009). 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 13, 282–287&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Sturm, Thomas (2012). The “rationality wars” in psychology: Where they are and where they could go. ''Inquiry'', 55, 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Brandt===
[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a "reforming definition" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
Abulof argues that rationality has become an "essentially contested concept," as its "proper use… inevitably involves endless disputes." He identifies "four fronts" for the disputes about the meaning of rationality: 
# The purpose, or function, of ascribing rationality: Is it descriptive/explanatory, prescriptive or subjunctive (rationality "as if" real)? 
# The subject of rationality: What, or who, is rational: the choice, the act, or the choosing actor?
# Cognition: What is the quality of the cognitive decision-making process: minimal (calculative intentionality) or optimal (expected-utility)? 
# Rationale: Is rationality merely instrumental, that is, agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations (instrumental rationality) or does it substantially inform them (substantive rationality, focusing on material maximization)?&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Abulof | first = Uriel | date = 2015 | title =  The Malpractice of Rationality in International Relations | journal =  Rationality and Society | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 358–384 | url = http://rss.sagepub.com/content/27/3/358.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by some philosophers (notably [[A.&amp;nbsp;C. Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and "mechanical". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.

Modern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theoretical and practical==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jesús Mosterín]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acción humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.

The distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.

Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús (2002). “Acceptance Without Belief”. ''Manuscrito'', vol. XXV, pp. 313–335.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.

==Examples in different fields==

===Logic===
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
As the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role and there are several strands to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are "really" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
Within [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of "performance", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using “rationality” in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Others are more critical.&lt;ref&gt;Walt, Stephen M. (1999) Rigor or Rigor Mortis?: Rational Choice and Security Studies. International Security 23 (4):5-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of "rationality" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. "Rationality" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to "foreign policy" allude to "rationality"—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on "malpractice": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of "rationality" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between "us and them."&lt;ref name=Abulof/&gt;

'''Rodomontade''' ''\rod-uh-muhn-TADE; roh-duh-muhn-TAHD\'' is a [[mass noun]] meaning boastful talk or behavior.  The term is a reference to [[Rodomonte]], a character in Italian Renaissance epic poems ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' and its sequel ''[[Orlando furioso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-rod1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Rodomontade|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use==
*A 17th-century example of the term exists in ''Don Tomazo'' by [[Thomas Dangerfield]], albeit with a slight alteration of spelling. As the titular protagonist heads towards Cairo with a number of stolen treasures, he is informed by an acquaintance that:
::''. . . he could, in that heathenish city, command a thousand pound – which was at that time no rodomontado, in regard the jewels were worth above four times the value.'' &lt;ref&gt;Don Tomazo, ''An Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Fiction'', ed. Paul Salzman (Aylesbury: Oxford University Press, 1991), p381.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The German composer [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] composed a [[Suite (music)|Suite]] in h minor for violin solo, strings and continuo (TWV 55: h4), which ends with a piece named "Rodomontade".&lt;ref&gt;Booklet to the CD: Georg Philipp Telemann, ''Overtures-Sonatas-Concertos (Concertos and Chambermusic Vol. 2)'', Musica Alta Ripa, MDG 309 1250-2, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 19th-century example of the use of the term can be found in ''The Adventures of [[Benjamin Bonneville|Captain Bonneville]]'' by [[Washington Irving]].  Irving used it to describe the behavior of "free trappers", [[Trapping|fur trappers]] who worked [[Freelancer|freelance]] and adopted the manner, habits, and dress of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]].  When free trappers visited Bonneville's camp, he welcomed them and ordered [[grog]] for everyone:
::''They [the free trappers] pronounced the captain the finest fellow in the world, and his men all ''bon garçons'', jovial lads, and swore they would pass the day with them.  They did so, and a day it was, of boast, and swagger, and ''rodomontade''.''

*Another 19th-century example can be found in Thomas Carlyle's 1829 essay ''Signs of the Times'':
::''We have more Mathematics than ever; but less Mathesis. Archimedes and Plato could not have read the Mécanique Céleste; but neither would the whole French Institute see aught in that saying, "God geometrises!" but a sentimental rodomontade.''

* Rex Stout uses it in the second Nero Wolfe novel, "The League of Frightened Men" (1935), when Wolfe says, "If Mr. Chapin had ... restrained his impulse to rodomontade ..."
*The word, with its alternative spelling (rhodomontade) is quoted in [[John Lukacs]]' book ''Five Days in London May 1940''.  While describing the tempestuous days of Churchill's first weeks in office, Lukacs quotes [[Alexander Cadogan]], a bureaucrat with the Foreign Office, counselling Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] who was complaining that he could no longer work with Churchill. Cadogan said:
::''Nonsense: his rhodomontades probably bore you as much as they do me, but don't do anything silly under the stress of that.''

*[[Hannah Arendt]] describes [[Adolf Eichmann|Adolf Eichmann's]] boasting as "sheer rodomontade" in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'':
::"Bragging was the vice that was Eichmann's undoing.  It was sheer rodomontade when he told his men during the last days of the war: 'I will jump into my grave laughing, because of the fact that I have the death of five million Jews...on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction.' ... [For Eichmann to] claim the death of five million Jews, the approximate total of losses suffered from the combined efforts of all Nazi offices and authorities, was preposterous...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arendt |first=Hannah |authorlink=Hannah Arendt |title=[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]] |year=1963 |publisher=Viking Press |location=New York |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The term was used in [[Desert Island Discs]] by the singer [[Morrissey]] when describing his own music.

*[[Anthony Parsons|Sir Anthony Parsons]] as [[Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations|UK Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations]] used the word during a speech on 22 May 1982 during a debate of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. He was describing the speeches of several other members including the [[USSR]], [[Cuba]] and [[Panama]] during that days debate on the [[Falklands War]]. He started the speech by saying:
::"Obviously we expected other delegations to give bent to atrociously offensive, confused and ill-directed rodomontades against my country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=22 May 1982 |title=May 22, 1982 ABC News Weekend Report Falkland Islands War|type=Television production |language=English |year=1982 |time=9:35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[William F. Buckley]] used the word in a May 29, 1995, column in the ''[[National Review]]'' entitled "What does [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] have in mind? – Pres. Clinton's attack on conservative radio broadcasts"; Buckley, asking rhetorically whom Clinton was attacking, cited one theory:
::''The best those commentators could do who appeared on the [[The MacNeil/Lehrer Report|MacNeil – Lehrer program]] was to quote an imprudent remark by [[G. Gordon Liddy|Gordon Liddy]], but what he said &amp;ndash; that if any official came to his house to requisition his pistol, he'd better shoot straight &amp;ndash; was more ''rodomontade'' than a call to arms or hatred.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v47/ai_16936619 What does Clinton have in mind?], a 1995 ''[[National Review]]'' column using the term, via FindArticles.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] uses the word to describe a letter written by the eponymous hero of 'The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.'.
* The term was used by W. Somerset Maugham in 'Of Human Bondage' in Athelny's conversation, over tea, with his daughter's suitor.
::'He (Athelny) addressed himself directly to his guest with a torrent of rhodomontade'. 
::
::Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey: 'mislead by the rodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit... (chapter 30)

* [[Vladimir Nabokov]] criticized [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] for his "gothic rodomontade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars|title=The Translation Wars|first=David|last=Remnick|date=31 October 2005|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Churchill: '..., but also revealed a plain soldier's distaste for the publicity rodomontade which always attended Churchill, and maybe a touch of perverse jealousy too' (chapter 3, 1899–1935).

'''Seiko Mikami'''  ([[Kanji]]:{{lang|ja|三上 晴子}}) was a Japanese artist known for her large-scale [[interactive art]] installations. Mikami was born in [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], [[Japan]], in 1961, and she stepped into the art scene in the mid-1980s with large-scale art that studied [[information society]] and the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami Project v.1|url=http://www.art-it.asia/u/admin_ed_pics/f4o3H5vQ1VldwERNiL6x/?lang=ja|website=ART iT|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to the United States in 1991, she studied computer science at the [[New York Institute of Technology]], which lead her art to focus on the interaction between electronics and the human perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://v2.nl/archive/people/seiko-mikami/|website=V2_|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a professor in the Department of Information Deisgn at [[Tama University]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami Project v.1|url=http://artscape.jp/exhibition/art-flash-news/2015/10115269_19232.html|website=artscape|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikami died from cancer on January 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adriaansens|first1=Alex|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://v2.nl/lab/blog/seiko-mikami-196120132015-1|website=V2_|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gravicells==
Unveiled in 2004, a collaboration between Mikami and the architect Sota Ichikawa resulted in ''Gravicells'', an interactive installation originally housed at the [[Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media]] (YCAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: YCAM presents Interactive Art Installation|url=http://www.idd.tamabi.ac.jp/~mikami/Gravity&amp;Resistance/outline2.html|publisher=Tama University|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece serves as a means for encountering the existence of [[gravity]] in a manner one could not experience in his or her daily life, and how the world, our bodies, and our perception are all influenced by gravity in complex and almost delicate ways. When the space is encountered by multiple participants, the visual interactions of the projection between them helps the users achieve a sense of each other. This artwork thus functions as almost an external human sensory function, encouraging awareness of ourselves and others in ways not previously approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spielmann|first1=Yvonne|title=Perceptual-responsive environments: sense and sensibility in Japanese media artist Seiko Mikami’s installations|journal=Journal of Aethsetics and Culture|date=2012|volume= 4|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center of the installation space rests a six-by-six-meter paneled floor; these panels are laced with sensors that can detect your weight, tilt, and velocity. This information is continuously collected and analyzed, and is then translated into deformations in the lines projected on the floor near the visitor. [[GPS]] data of the location in which the installation is housed also affects the projected environment and the lines will change according to shifts in the location's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gravicells - gravity and resistance|url=http://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/feature/2008/Openspace2008/Works/gravicells.html|website=Intercommunication Center|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire of Codes==
One of Mikami's most notable works, ''Desire of Codes'', was commissioned by and created at YCAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/37069/seiko-mikami/|website=e-flux|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring the individual’s existence in public and in private, ''Desire of Codes'' emphasizes the increasingly less blurred line between the individual as defined by information and the individual as flesh and blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takei|first1=Mariko|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/04/seiko_mikami.html|website=SHIFT|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in a space normally devoted to theatrical performances, this interactive piece consists of three parts:

# 90 Wriggling Wall Units: Ninety tentacle-like devices that rotate towards the passerby are placed across a large wall. These devices each have their own camera and microphone, and the data they record is sent to the work’s [[database]], and this information is eventually used in part 3.
# 6 Multiperspective Search Arms: Six ‘search arms’ with cameras and projectors hang from the ceiling and follow the movement of the visitors. These arms also record information about the visitors and upload this to the database. Eventually the arms may project enlarged images of the visitor on the floor near visitor themselves.
# Compound Eye Detector Screen: Many hexagonal facets are projected onto a circular screen, and each facet contains either one of the video recordings made by a wall unit or surveillance footage taken from various public places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desire of Codes|url=http://special.ycam.jp/doc/work/index_en.html|publisher=YCAM|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main three parts, the [[soundscape]] of the area in which the work resides is also altered: the noise generated by visitors as well as the artwork’s own mechanical sounds are mixed and played back, which further emphasizes the indistinction between one's own encoded existence and physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Christine|title=SPATIAL POLITICS: THE (NON)DESTINATIONS OF AUGMENTED REALITY ART (PART II)|journal=Afterimage|volume= 38 Issue 3|issue=Nov/Dec 2010|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">The '''Shapley–Sawyer Concentration Class''' is a classification system on a scale of one to twelve using [[Roman numerals]] for [[globular cluster]]s according to their concentration. The most highly concentrated clusters such as [[Messier 75|M75]] are classified as Class I, with successively diminishing concentrations ranging to Class XII, such as [[Palomar 12]]. (The class is sometimes given with numbers [Class 1–12] rather than with Roman numerals.)

== History ==
From 1927–1929, [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Helen Sawyer Hogg]] began categorizing clusters according to the degree of concentration the system has toward the core using this scale. This became known as the ''Shapley–Sawyer Concentration Class''.&lt;ref name="Hogg1965"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">{{Other uses of|smoking gun|Smoking gun (disambiguation)}}
The term "'''smoking gun'''" is a reference to an object or fact that serves as conclusive [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of a [[crime]] or similar act, just short of being caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''. "''Smoking gun''" refers to the strongest kind of [[circumstantial evidence]], as opposed to [[direct evidence]]. Direct evidence would include the entire action: Pulling the trigger, firing the gun, and the victim falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Legal Argumentation and Evidence |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Phrase origin==
The phrase originally came from the idea that finding a very recently fired (hence smoking) gun on the person of a suspect wanted for shooting someone, which in that situation would be nearly unshakable proof of having committed the crime. The phrase originated in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story, "[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott]]" (1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-1-26-03-on-language-smoking-gun.html &lt;!-- redirect from http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5DE1130F935A15752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all --&gt; |department=The Way We Live Now |series=On Language |title=Smoking Gun |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2003 |accessdate=2015-05-06 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended meaning==
In addition to this, its meaning has evolved in uses completely unrelated to criminal activity: for example, scientific evidence that is highly suggestive in favor of a particular hypothesis is sometimes called "smoking gun evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smoking%20gun |title=Smoking Gun |accessdate=2018-01-30 |website=[[Merriam-Webster.com]] |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space launch''' is the earliest part of a [[flight]] that [[Spaceflight#Reaching space|reaches space]]. Space launch involves [[Takeoff|liftoff]], when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, [[Sea Launch|floating ship]] or [[Antonov An-225|midair aircraft]] at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: [[rocket launch]] (the current conventional method), and [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] (where other forms of propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds).

==Issues with reaching space==

===Definition of space===
Space has no physical edge to it as the atmospheric pressure gradually reduces with altitude; instead, the edge of space is defined by convention, often the [[Kármán line]] of 100&amp;nbsp;km. Other definitions have been created as well, in the US for example space has been defined as 50 miles.

===Energy===
Therefore, by definition for spaceflight to occur, sufficient altitude is necessary. This implies a minimum gravitational [[potential energy]] needs to be overcome: for the Kármán line this is approximately 1 MJ/kg.
W=mgh, m=1&amp;nbsp;kg, g=9.82&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, h=10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;m.
W=1*9.82*10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;≈10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;J/kg=1MJ/kg

In practice, a higher energy than this is needed to be expended due to losses such as airdrag, propulsive efficiency, cycle efficiency of engines that are employed and [[gravity drag]].

In the past fifty years spaceflight has usually meant remaining in space for a period of time, rather than going up and immediately falling back to earth. This entails orbit, which is mostly a mater of velocity, not altitude, although that does not mean air friction and relevant altitudes in relation to that and orbit don't have to be taken into account. At much, much, higher altitudes than many orbital ones maintained by satellites, altitude begins to become a larger and larger factor and speed a lesser one. At lower altitudes, due to the high speed required to remain in orbit, air friction is a very important consideration affecting satellites, much more than in the popular image of space. At even lower altitudes, balloons, with no forward velocity, can serve many of the roles satellites play.

===G-forces===
Many cargoes, particularly humans have a limiting [[g-force]] that they can survive. For humans this is about 3-6 g. Some launchers such as gun launchers would give accelerations in the hundred or thousands of g and thus are completely unsuitable.

===Reliability===
Launchers vary with respect to their reliability for achieving the mission.

===Safety===
Safety is the probability of causing injury or loss of life. Unreliable launchers are not necessarily unsafe, whereas reliable launchers are usually, but not invariably safe.

Apart from catastrophic failure of the launch vehicle itself other safety hazards include depressurisation, and the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] which preclude orbits which spend long periods within them.

===Trajectory optimisation===
[[Trajectory optimization]] is the process of designing a [[trajectory]] that minimizes or maximizes some [[figure of merit|measure of performance]] within prescribed constraint boundaries.  While not exactly the same, the goal of solving a trajectory optimization problem is essentially the same as solving an [[optimal control]] problem. This problem was first studied by [[Robert H. Goddard]] and is also known as the [[Goddard problem]].
     
The selection of flight profiles that yield the greatest performance plays a substantial role in the preliminary design of flight vehicles, since the use of ad-hoc profile or control policies to evaluate competing configurations may inappropriately penalize the performance of one configuration over another.  Thus, to guarantee the selection of the best vehicle design, it is important to optimize the profile and control policy for each configuration early in the design process.

For example, for [[tactical missile]]s, the flight profiles are determined by the thrust and [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] (lift) histories.  These histories can be controlled by a number of means including such techniques as using an [[angle of attack]] command history or an altitude/downrange schedule that the missile must follow.  Each combination of missile design factors, desired missile performance, and system constraints results in a new set of optimal control parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, C.A, "Energy Management for a Multiple Pulse Missile", AIAA Paper 88-0334, Jan., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustained spaceflight==

===Suborbital launch===
{{Main|suborbital spaceflight}}
Sub-orbital space flight is any space launch that reaches space without doing a full orbit around the planet, and requires a maximum speed of around 1&amp;nbsp;km/s just to reach space, and up to 7&amp;nbsp;km/s for longer distance such as an intercontinental space flight. An example of a sub-orbital flight would be a ballistic missile, or future tourist flight such as [[Virgin Galactic]], or an intercontinental transport flight like [[SpaceLiner]]. Any space launch without an orbit-optimization correction to achieve a stable orbit will result in a suborbital space flight, unless there is sufficient thrust to leave orbit completely. (See [[Space gun#Getting to orbit]])

===Orbital launch===
{{Main|orbital spaceflight}}
In addition, if orbit is required, then a much greater amount of energy must be generated in order to give the craft some sideways speed. The speed that must be achieved depends on the altitude of the orbit – less speed is needed at high altitude. However, after allowing for the extra potential energy of being at higher altitudes, overall more energy is used reaching higher orbits than lower ones.

The speed needed to maintain an orbit near the Earth's surface corresponds to a sideways speed of about 7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s (17,400&amp;nbsp;mph), an energy of about 30MJ/kg. This is several times the energy per kg of practical [[rocket propellant]] mixes.

Gaining the kinetic energy is awkward as the airdrag tends to slow the spacecraft, so rocket-powered spacecraft generally fly a compromise trajectory that leaves the thickest part of the atmosphere very early on, and then fly on for example, a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] to reach the particular orbit that is required. This minimises the airdrag as well as minimising the time that the vehicle spends holding itself up. Airdrag is a significant issue with essentially all proposed and current launch systems, although usually less so than the difficulty of obtaining enough kinetic energy to simply reach orbit at all.

===Escape velocity===
{{Main|Escape velocity}}
If the Earth's gravity is to be overcome entirely then sufficient energy must be obtained by a spacecraft to exceed the depth of the gravity potential energy well. Once this has occurred, provided the energy is not lost in any non-conservative way, then the vehicle will leave the influence of the Earth. The depth of the potential well depends on the vehicle's position, and the energy depends on the vehicle's speed. If the kinetic energy exceeds the potential energy then escape occurs. At the Earth's surface this occurs at a speed of 11.2&amp;nbsp;km/s (25,000&amp;nbsp;mph), but in practice a much higher speed is needed due to airdrag.

==Types of space launch==

===Rocket launch===
{{Main|rocket launch}}
Rocket launch is the only current way to reach space. In some cases an airbreathing (jet engine) first stage has been used as well.

===Non-rocket launch===
{{Main|non-rocket launch}}
'''Non-rocket space launch''' is a launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than expendable [[rocket]]s.  A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed.  In some systems such as [[Skyhook (structure)|Skyhooks]], [[rocket sled launch]], and [[air launch to orbit|air launch]], a rocket is used to reach orbit, but it is only part of the system.

[[File:Space Engineers 5.jpg|thumb|''Space Engineers'' video game: 3D spatial navigation]]
'''Spatial ability''' or visuo-spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = Spatial ability|date = |accessdate = |website = www.jhu.edu|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, [[mathematics]], natural sciences, [[engineering]], economic forecasting, [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = What is spatial ability?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University|author = Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through visual representation in the mind.

== Definition and types ==
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental rotation]] on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory. [[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store a certain amount of visual-spatial memories under attentional control in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparison of Laboratory and Clinical Working Memory Tests and Their Prediction of Fluid Intelligence|journal = Intelligence|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 0160-2896|pmc = 2818304|pmid = 20161647|pages = 283|volume = 37|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.11.005|first = Jill T.|last = Shelton|first2 = Emily M.|last2 = Elliott|first3 = B. D.|last3 = Hill|first4 = Matthew R.|last4 = Calamia|first5 = Wm. Drew|last5 = Gouvier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities such as mental rotation.

=== Spatial perception ===
[[File:Видеоскриншот из игры S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile.gif|thumb|Action shooting game: Use of spatial perceptual skills]]
Spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~asimmons/pdfs/PT%20Spatial%20Perception.pdf|title = Spatial Perception from a Cartesian Point of View|last = Simmons|first = Alison|date = 2003|journal = Philosophical Topics |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand its visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the [[rod and frame test]], where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the [[water-level task]], where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a tilted bottle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Spatial perception is also very relevant in sports. For example, a study found that [[cricket]] players who were faster at picking up information from briefly presented visual displays were significantly better batsmen in an actual game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inspection time and high-speed ball games|journal = Perception|date = 1989-01-01|issn = 0301-0066|pmid = 2628929|pages = 789–792|volume = 18|issue = 6|first = I. J.|last = Deary|first2 = H.|last2 = Mitchell|doi=10.1068/p180789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that soccer players had higher perceptual ability for body kinematics such as processing multitasking crowd scenes which involve pedestrians crossing a street or complex dynamic visual scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of sport specific and non-specific biological motion perception in soccer athletes shows a fundamental perceptual ability advantage over non-athletes for recognizing body kinematics|journal = Journal of Vision|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1534-7362|pmid = &lt;!--none--&gt;|pages = 504|volume = 15|issue = 12|doi = 10.1167/15.12.504|first = Thomas|last = Romeas|first2 = Jocelyn|last2 = Faubert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the ''Journal of Human Kinetics'' on fencing athletes found that achievement level was highly correlated with spatial perceptual skills such as visual discrimination, visual-spatial relationships, visual sequential memory, narrow attentional focus and visual information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Attention, Visual Perception and their Relationship to Sport Performance in Fencing|journal = Journal of Human Kinetics|date = 2013-12-31|issn = 1640-5544|pmc = 3916930|pmid = 24511355|pages = 195–201|volume = 39|doi = 10.2478/hukin-2013-0082|first = Mona Mohamed Kamal|last = Hijazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal of ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that spatial perception involves attributing meaning to an object or space, so that their sensory processing is actually part of semantic processing of the incoming visual information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual cognition: a new look at the two-visual systems model|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0028-3932|pmid = 15707914|pages = 301–312|volume = 43|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.016|first = M.|last = Jeannerod|first2 = P.|last2 = Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that spatial perception involves the [[Visual system|human visual system]] in the brain and the [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobule]] which is responsible for visuomotor processing and visually goal-directed action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Studies have also found that individuals who played first person shooting games had better spatial perceptual skills like faster and more accurate performance in a peripheral and identification task while simultaneously performing a central search.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Playing shooter and driving videogames improves top-down guidance in visual search|journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1943-393X|pmid = 23460295|pages = 673–686|volume = 75|issue = 4|doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0440-2|first = Sijing|last = Wu|first2 = Ian|last2 = Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggested that, in addition to enhancing the ability to divide attention, playing  action games significantly enhances perceptual skills like top-down guidance of attention to possible target locations.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686" /&gt;

=== Mental rotation ===
[[File:Rubik's cube 2.svg|thumb|[[Rubik's cube]]: a popular puzzle that involves 3D mental rotation]][[Mental rotation]] is the ability to mentally represent and ''rotate'' 2D and 3D objects in space quickly and accurately, while the object's features remain unchanged. Mental representations of physical objects can help utilize problem solving and understanding. For example, Hegarty (2004) showed that people manipulate mental representations for reasoning about mechanical problems, such as how gears or pulleys work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Psychology Laboratory - About Mental Rotation|url = http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx|website = opl.apa.org|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Schwartz and Black (1999) found that doing such mental simulations such as pouring water improves people's skill to find the solution to questions about the amount of tilt required for containers of different heights and widths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the field of sports psychology, coaches for a variety of sports (e.g. basketball, gymnastics, soccer or golf) have promoted players to use mental imagery and manipulation as one technique for performance in their game. (Jones &amp; Stuth, 1997)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Recent research (e.g., Cherney, 2008) has also demonstrated evidence that playing video games with consistent practice can improve mental rotation skills, for example improvements in women's scores  after practice with a game that involved a race within a 3-D environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Same effects have been seen playing action video games such as [[Unreal Tournament]] as well as the popular mainstream game [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The virtual brain: 30 years of video-game play and cognitive abilities|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2013-09-13|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 3772618|pmid = 24062712|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00629|first = Andrew J.|last = Latham|first2 = Lucy L. M.|last2 = Patston|first3 = Lynette J.|last3 = Tippett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] puzzles and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] are also activities that involve higher level of mental rotation and can be practiced to improve spatial abilities over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Puzzle Play: A predictor of preschoolers’ spatial transformation skill|journal = Developmental Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 0012-1649|pmc = 3289766|pmid = 22040312|pages = 530–542|volume = 48|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0025913|first = S.C.|last = Levine|first2 = K.R.|last2 = Ratliff|first3 = J.|last3 = Huttenlocher|first4 = J.|last4 = Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-05-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2677592|pmid = 19528020|pages = 1377–1383|volume = 364|issue = 1522|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0337|first = Simon|last = Baron-Cohen|first2 = Emma|last2 = Ashwin|first3 = Chris|last3 = Ashwin|first4 = Teresa|last4 = Tavassoli|first5 = Bhismadev|last5 = Chakrabarti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adolescence: The Transitional Years|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sz20BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2014-05-10|isbn = 9781483265650|first = J. Roy|last = Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental rotation is also unique and distinct from the other spatial abilities because it also involves areas associated with [[Motor skill|motor simulation]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of mental rotation: a meta-analysis and review|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0898-929X|pmid = 17919082|pages = 1–19|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20013|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Zacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial visualization ===
Spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves [[Mental image|visual imagery]] which is the ability to mentally represent visual appearances of an object, and [[Mental image|spatial imagery]] which consists of mentally representing spatial relations between the parts or locations of the objects or movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ideal-group.org/visualization-research/Spatial-Visualization-Visual-Imagery-and-Mathematical-Problem-Solving-of-Students-with-Varying-Abilities.pdf|title = Spatial Visualization, Visual Imagery, and Mathematical Problem Solving of Students With Varying Abilities|last = Van Garderen|first = Delinda|date = 2006|journal = JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES VOLUME 39, NUMBER 6|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in the domains of science and technology. For example, an astronomer must mentally visualize the structures of a solar system and the motions of the objects within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer mentally visualizes the interactions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to design or work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which can be viewed as abstract models of molecules with most of the spatial information deleted; spatial skills are important in restoring that information when more detailed mental models of the molecules are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Spatial visualization also involves imagining and working with visual details of measurement, shapes, motion, features and properties through mental imagery and using this spatial relations to derive at an understanding to a problem. Whereas spatial perception involves understanding externally via the senses, spatial visualization is the understanding internally through mental imagery in one's mind.

Another critical spatial visualization ability is '''mental animation'''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: evidence from dual-task studies|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|date = 1997-05-01|issn = 0090-502X|pmid = 9184484|pages = 321–332|volume = 25|issue = 3|first = V. K.|last = Sims|first2 = M.|last2 = Hegarty|doi=10.3758/bf03211288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental animation is mentally visualizing the motion and movement of components within any form of system or in general.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is an ability highly crucial in mechanical reasoning and understanding, for example mental animation in mechanical tasks can involve deconstructing a pulley system mentally into smaller units and animating them in the corresponding sequence or laws in the mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation: inferring motion from static displays of mechanical systems|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date = 1992-09-01|issn = 0278-7393|pmid = 1402712|pages = 1084–1102|volume = 18|issue = 5|first = M.|last = Hegarty|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.5.1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, mental animation is mental imagining how mechanical objects work by analyzing the motion of their smaller parts.

'''Mental folding''' is a complex spatial visualization that involves the ''folding'' of 2D pattern or material into 3D objects and representations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Paper Folding Performance Following Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury in Combat Veterans: A Lesion Mapping Study|journal = Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1047-3211|pmc = 3673178|pmid = 22669970|pages = 1663–1672|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs153|first = Leila|last = Glass|first2 = Frank|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Jeffrey|last3 = Solomon|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Raymont|first5 = Jordan|last5 = Grafman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other studies, mental folding has had relatively little research and study. In comparison to mental rotation, mental folding is a non-rigid spatial transformation ability which means features of the manipulated object end up changing unlike mental rotation. In rigid manipulations, the object itself is not changed but rather its spatial position or orientation is, whereas in non-rigid transformations like mental folding the object and shapes are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding|journal = Cognitive Processing|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1612-4790|pmid = 23397105|pages = 105–115|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10339-013-0544-6|first = Justin|last = Harris|first2 = Kathy|last2 = Hirsh-Pasek|first3 = Nora S.|last3 = Newcombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental folding in tasks usually require a series of mental rotations to sequentially fold the object into a new one. Classic mental folding tests are the Paper folding task which is similar to [[Origami]]. Origami also requires mental folding by assessing folding a 2D paper enough times to create a 3D figure.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

'''Visual penetrative ability''' is least common spatial visualization task which involves ability to imagine what is inside an object based on the features outside.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Spatial working memory ==
[[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store visual-spatial memories under [[attentional control]], in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. Spatial working memory involves storing large amounts of short-term spatial memories in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad. It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split  into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|last1 = Baddeley|first1 = A.D.|year = 2000|title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 4|issue = 11|pages = 417–423|pmid = 11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocational applications ==
Researchers have found that spatial ability plays an important role in advanced educational credentials in the science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Wai2009SpatialAbility.pdf|title = Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of cumulative psychological Knowledge solidifies Its importance|last = Wai|first = Jonathan|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Educational Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0016127|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?|journal = Developmental Science|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1363-755X|pmc = 3997754|pmid = 24410830|pages = 462–470|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/desc.12138|first = Maria Grazia|last = Tosto|first2 = Ken B.|last2 = Hanscombe|first3 = Claire M.A.|last3 = Haworth|first4 = Oliver S.P.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Stephen A.|last5 = Petrill|first6 = Philip S.|last6 = Dale|first7 = Sergey|last7 = Malykh|first8 = Robert|last8 = Plomin|first9 = Yulia|last9 = Kovas}}&lt;/ref&gt; From studies, it has been indicated that the probability of getting an advanced degree in STEM increases in positive relation to the level of one's spatial ability. For example, a 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] found that 45% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were within top percentage of high spatial ability in a group of 400,000 participants who were analyzed for 11 years since they were in the 12th grade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only less than 10% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were below the top quarter in spatial ability during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers then concluded how important spatial ability is for [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] and as a factor in achieving advanced educational success in that field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in [[science]] and [[technology]]. For example, an [[astronomer]] must visually imagine the structures of a solar system, and the path of the bodies within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer must visually imagine the motions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which are essentially abstract models supposed to represent spatial dynamics of molecules, and thus spatial skills are important in visualizing the molecule models that are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Spatial manipulation ability is also important in the field of structural geology, when visually imagining how rocks change through time, such as migration of a magma body through crust or progressive folding of a strati-graphic succession. Another spatial visualization skill known as ''visual penetrative ability'' is important in geology as it requires geologists to visualize what is inside of a solid object based on past knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nagt-jge.org/doi/pdf/10.5408/1.3559671|title = Characterizing and Improving Spatial Visualization Skills|last = Titus|first = Sarah|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Geoscience Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature also indicates that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2008 review published in the journal of ''Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews'' found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0149-7634|pmid = 18584868|pages = 1361–1372|volume = 32|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.015|first = Maria Dolores|last = de Hevia|first2 = Giuseppe|last2 = Vallar|first3 = Luisa|last3 = Girelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of visual information in numerosity estimation|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3355123|pmid = 22616007|pages = e37426|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037426|first = Titia|last = Gebuis|first2 = Bert|last2 = Reynvoet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing arithmetic by hand: hand movements during exact arithmetic reveal systematic, dynamic spatial processing|journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1747-0226|pmid = 25051274|pages = 1579–1596|volume = 67|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17470218.2014.897359|first = Tyler|last = Marghetis|first2 = Rafael|last2 = Núñez|first3 = Benjamin K.|last3 = Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study published in the journal of ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'' also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual perception can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and computational fluency|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 4563146|pmid = 26441740|pages = 1364|volume = 6|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364|first = Xinlin|last = Zhou|first2 = Wei|last2 = Wei|first3 = Yiyun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Jiaxin|last4 = Cui|first5 = Chuansheng|last5 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the journal of [[Cognitive science|''Cognitive Science'']] also found that spatial visualization ability is crucial for solving [[Kinematics|kinematic]] problems in physics. Nonetheless, current literature indicates that spatial abilities specifically mental rotation, is crucial for achieving success in various fields of chemistry, engineering and physics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spatial Ability in Learning Engineering Mechanics: Critical Review|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282853648_Spatial_Ability_in_Learning_Engineering_Mechanics_Critical_Review|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-15|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Standard RPG System''' (SRS for short) is a Japanese [[role-playing game system]] developed by [[FarEast Amusement Research]] and used in ''[[Alshard]]'', ''[[Tenra War]]'', ''Kaze no Stigma RPG'', ''[[Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica]] RPG'' and so on. The newest, the 14th game that use SRS are the ''[[Full Metal Panic!]] RPG'' based upon the [[anime]] and [[light novel]]s  of the same title. SRS games are published by several companies such as Game Field, Softbank Creative, JIVE and [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa]](Former [[Enterbrain]] and [[Fujimi Shobo]]).

Standard RPG System is available under an open content license for non-commercial uses.

==Core mechanic==
Standard RPG System uses only 6-sided dice. To determine whether the action is successful or not the player rolls only [[dice notation|2d6]], if the total of the dice rolled by the player and ability/class adjustments is more than or equal to difficulty score the action succeeds. To determine damage the player rolls a number of 6-sided dice. The number of dice that are rolled increases with various class abilities.

Players choose up to three [[character class]]es during [[character creation]] - for example, fighter/fighter/fighter (a 3rd-level fighter), valkyrie/valkyrie/scout (a 2nd-level valkyrie/1st-level scout), or black magician/white mage/wizard (a 1st-level black magician/1st-level white mage/1st-level wizard).

There are 6 [[statistic (role-playing games)|attributes]]: ''Tairyoku'' "Strength", ''Hansha'' "Reflexes", ''Chikaku'' "Perception", ''Richi'' "Reason", ''Ishi'' "Will" and ''Kouun'' "Luck". In [[Tenra War]], ''[[Tianxia|Tenka]]'', representing social ability, is present instead of ''Kouun''. Characters' attributes are decided by the selection of classes almost automatically. Attribute scores also determine the eight combat ability scores.

==Scene system==
{{see also|:ja:シーン制}}

The game session is proceeded under the "Scene system" and divided into 4 phases: opening phase, middle phase, climax phase and ending phase.
In the opening phase, [[player character]]s (PCs) get into the incident with each one having a motivation such as business, adventure, curiosity and romantic feeling for the heroine. PCs do not need to make up a party in this phase. In the middle phase, the PCs get together. And they fight against creatures and research the incident.
In the climax phase, the boss enemy appears as the arch-foe against PCs. The ending phase is the phase for the epilogue.
Each phase is also divided into several scenes. The Game Master(GM) chooses a ''scene player'' as the scene's protagonist. If the GM allows and the player succeed in an Appear roll, other PCs can appear on the scene as well.

==Breakthrough systems==
Each SRS game have a different "Breakthrough system" work much like hero points.

In ''[[Alshard]]'' and ''[[Alshard Gaia]]'', characters possess supreme divine powers according to their classes. For example, fighters possess the power of 'Thor', which adds extra damage to damage rolls, while white mages possess the power of 'Idun', which can raise the dead. Supreme divine powers are named ''Kago'' (加護, lit. divine protection). Each character can use ''Kago'' three times every a session, according to the three classes chosen during character creation.

In ''[[Tenra War]]'', its Breakthrough system is called ''Gou system'' (業システム, lit. [[karma]] system). Player characters earn ''[[Aikido#Etymology_and_basic_philosophy|Aiki]]'' (合気, lit. harmonious spirit) points by good [[roleplaying]] in the sessions. ''Aiki points'' can be transferred into ''Kiai'' (気合, lit. fighting spirit or willpower) points work much like costs for more powerful abilities.

Player characters in ''Kaze no Stigma RPG'' and ''[[Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica]] RPG'' can use ''Kizuna Kouka'' (絆効果, lit. bonds effect) depends on their human relationships.

Trinity x Venus SRS is based upon the [[superhero]] [[manga]] of the same title. Player Characters are the users of supernatural abilities called V.I.P. abilities. Trinity x Venus SRS's breakthrough system is named ''Advanced V.I.P. system'', PCs (player characters) can use customizable supernatural abilities.

==Overview==
''Geworfen'' denotes the arbitrary or inscrutable nature of ''[[Dasein]]'' that connects the past with the present.  The past, through [[Being-toward-death]], becomes a part of ''Dasein''. Awareness and acknowledgment of the arbitrariness of ''Dasein'' is characterized as a state of "thrown-ness" in the present with all its attendant frustrations, sufferings, and demands that one does not choose, such as social conventions or ties of kinship and duty. The very fact of one's own existence is a manifestation of thrown-ness. The idea of the past as a matrix not chosen, but at the same time not utterly binding or deterministic, results in the notion of ''Geworfenheit''—a kind of alienation that human beings struggle against,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=William J.|authorlink=William J.

:[T]he thrower of the PROJECT is THROWN in his own throw. How can we account for this freedom? We cannot. It is simply a fact, not caused or grounded, but the condition of all causation and grounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael J.|last=Inwood|title=A Heidegger Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfHJke63FNkC|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]|location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|date =1999 |isbn=978-0-631-19095-0 |id={{ISBN|0-63119095-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[William J. Richardson]], ''Geworfenheit'' "must be understood in a purely [[ontology|ontological]] sense as wishing to signify the matter-of-fact character of human finitude".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, William J. (1963). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C0cf3q3NJuwC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22thrown-ness%22+%22(Geworfenheit)+,+which+must+be+understood+in+a+purely+ontological+sense+as+wishing+to+signify+the+matter-of-fact+character+of+human+finitude%22 37].&lt;/ref&gt; That's why "thrownness" is the best English word for ''Geworfenheit''. Richardson: "[Other] attractive translations such as '[[abandonment (existentialism)#Martin Heidegger|abandon]],' 'dereliction,' '[[Depression (mood)|dejection]],' etc. [...] are [dangerous because they are] too rich with [[ontic]], [[anthropology|anthropological]] connotations. We retain 'thrown-ness' as closest to the original and, perhaps, least misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, William J. (1963). p.

In his main work ''[[The Principle of Hope]]'' (1954-9), the anti-Heideggerian author [[Ernst Bloch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Listening for Utopia in Ernst Bloch's Musical Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SinUwMlJZbsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | first = Benjamin M. | last = Korstvedt | date = 2010 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=SinUwMlJZbsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Ernst+Bloch%22+Heidegger+Geworfenheit+Thrownness+%22Bloch+specifically+criticized+the+futile+quiescence+inherent+in+Heidegger's%22 44] |isbn=978-0-521-89615-3 | id={{ISBN|0-52189615-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; has correlated the thrownness into the world with a dog's life: hope "will not tolerate a dog's life which feels itself only passively thrown into What Is, which is not seen through, even wretchedly recognized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Ernst | authorlink = Ernst Bloch | title = The Principle of Hope| date = 1954 | volume = Volume 1 | page =[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Ernst+Bloch%22%22It+will+not+tolerate+a+dog's+life+which+feels+itself+only+passively+thrown+into+What+Is,+which+is+not+seen+through,+even+wretchedly+recognized%22 3]}} In German: "[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Ernst+Bloch%22%22Sie+erträgt+kein+Hundeleben,+das+sich+ins+Seiende+nur+passiv+geworfen+fühlt,+in+undurchschautes,+gar+jämmerlich+anerkanntes%22 ''Sie erträgt kein Hundeleben, das sich ins Seiende nur passiv '''geworfen''' fühlt, in undurchschautes, gar jämmerlich anerkanntes'']."&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a connection had been picked up by [[The Doors]] in a verse of their song "[[Riders on the Storm]]" (1971): "Into this world we're thrown / Like a dog without a bone". Speaking with [[Robby Krieger|Krieger]] and [[Ray Manzarek|Manzarek]], the philosopher Thomas Vollmer tells how this verse recalls Heidegger's concept of thrownness: in 1963 at [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Jim Morrison]] heard an influential lesson for him, where were discussed philosophers who had a critical look at the philosophical tradition, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and Martin Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} {{cite book|title=The Doors - Sounds for Your Soul - Die Musik Der Doors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xk_-cOcPH4C&amp;printsec=frontcover|author= Gerstenmeyer, Heinz| date =2001| page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=8xk_-cOcPH4C&amp;pg=196&amp;dq=%22Into+this+world+we're+thrown%22%22erinnert+an+Heideggers+'Geworfenheit'+(als+Grundbefindlichkeit+menschlichen+Daseins)%22%22Jim+Morrison+hat+1963+an+der+Florida+State+University+in+Tallahassee+eine+für+ihn+einflußreiche+Vorlesung+gehört,+in+der+Philosophen+besprochen+wurden,+die+sich+kritisch+mit+der+philosophischen+Tradition+auseinandergesetzt+haben,+darunter+Friedrich+Nietzsche+und+eben+auch+Martin+Heidegger)%22 196] | isbn=978-3-831-12057-4 | id={{ISBN|3-831120-57-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, [[Simon Critchley]] dedicated his column on ''[[The Guardian]]'' to Heidegger's concept of thrownness and explained it using the aforementioned verse of The Doors.&lt;ref name=S.C.&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Critchley|authorlink=Simon Critchley|title=''Being and Time'', part 4: Thrown into this world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/29/religion-philosophy|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=May 27, 2013|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=Manchester|quote=As Jim Morrison intoned many decades ago, 'Into this world we're thrown'.

A New Foundation for Design'', authors [[Terry Winograd]] and [[Fernando Flores]] applied Heidegger's concept of thrownness to the field of software design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Computers and Cognition.

* c. 1025 – [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth [[Exponentiation|powers]], and in turn, he develops an algorithm for determining the general formula for the sum of any [[integral]] powers, which was fundamental to the development of [[integral|integral calculus]]&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995). "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3), pp. 163–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''triune brain''' is a model of the [[evolution]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[forebrain]] and behavior, proposed by the American physician and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Paul D. MacLean]]. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book ''The Triune Brain in Evolution''.&lt;ref name="KHEPER"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kazlev| first = M. Alan| title = The Triune Brain.| work = KHEPER| date = 2003-10-19| url = http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031119214318/http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-11-19| accessdate = 2007-05-25| display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triune brain consists of the [[Basal ganglia|reptilian complex]], the paleomammalian complex ([[limbic system]]), and the neomammalian complex ([[neocortex]]), viewed as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis is no longer espoused by the majority of comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era.&lt;ref&gt;Kiverstein, J., &amp; Miller, M. (2015). The embodied brain: towards a radical embodied cognitive neuroscience. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 9, 237. http://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00237&lt;/ref&gt; 
The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through [[Carl Sagan]]'s [[Pulitzer prize]] winning 1977 book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]''. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading [[affective neuroscience]] researcher.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. (2003). Foreword to Cory, G. and Gardner, R. (2002) ''The Evolutionary Neuroethology of Paul MacLean: Convergences and Frontiers''. {{ISBN|978-0275972196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reptilian complex ==
The reptilian complex, also known as the R-complex or "reptilian brain" was the name MacLean gave to the [[basal ganglia]], structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Paleomammalian complex ==
The paleomammalian brain consists of the [[septum]], [[amygdalae]], [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal complex]], and [[cingulate cortex]]. MacLean first introduced the term "[[limbic system]]" to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean's recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain was widely accepted among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence "paleomammalian") and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behaviour, and parental behaviour.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Neomammalian complex ==
The neomammalian complex consists of the cerebral [[neocortex]], a structure found uniquely in higher mammals, and especially humans. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammalian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Status of the model ==
MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by [[Ludwig Edinger]], [[Elizabeth C. Crosby]] and Charles Judson Herrick early in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reiner|first=A. |year=1990 |title=An Explanation of Behavior |journal=Science |volume=250 |pages=303–305 |doi=10.1126/science.250.4978.303-a|pmid=17797318|issue=4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution&gt;[[Georg F. Striedter|Striedter, G. F.]] (2005) ''Principles of Brain Evolution.'' Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis.

For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean's reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called [[sauropsids]]) than previously supposed, and to exist in [[amphibians]] and [[fish]] as well as [[mammals]] and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles.

Some recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the [[New Caledonian crow]] and the language-like categorization abilities of the [[grey parrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Patton |title= One World, Many Minds: Intelligence in the Animal Kingdom |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=one-world-many-minds |work= Scientific American |date= December 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The "paleomammalian" trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well.  Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals.&lt;ref name="PrinciplesBrainEvolution"/&gt; In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium,  consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex).&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[telencephalon]] of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt; like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking.

== Lay interest ==
The triune model of the mammalian brain is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme by some in the field of comparative neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = CU | year = 2010 | title = The triune brain in antiquity: Plato, Aristotle, Erasistratus | url = | journal = [[Journal of the History of the Neurosciences]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | doi = 10.1080/09647040802601605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to hold public interest because of its simplicity. While technically inaccurate in many respects as an explanation for brain activity, it remains one of very few approximations of the truth we have to work with:  the "neocortex" represents that cluster of brain structures involved in advanced cognition, including planning, modeling and simulation; the "limbic brain" refers to those brain structures, wherever located, associated with social and nurturing behaviors, mutual reciprocity, and other behaviors and affects that arose during the age of the mammals; and the "reptilian brain" refers to those brain structures related to territoriality, ritual behavior and other "reptile" behaviors.  The broad explanatory value makes this approximation very engaging and is a useful level of complexity for high school students to begin engaging with brain research.
 
[[Howard Bloom]], in his book ''[[The Lucifer Principle]]'', references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. [[Arthur Koestler]] made MacLean's concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''. English novelist [[Julian Barnes]] quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel ''Before She Met Me''. Peter A. Levine uses the triune brain concept in his book ''Waking the Tiger'' to explain his [[somatic experiencing]] approach to healing trauma.

Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, in her book, "The Secret Dowry of Eve, Women's Role in the Development of Consciousness," references the triune theory explored by MacLean, and she goes one step further.  Her theory about human behavior and the problems we create with that behavior, distinguishes the prefrontal cortex as uniquely different from the rest of the neocortex.  The prefrontal cortex, with its agenda of integration, is the part of the brain that can get the other parts to work together for the good of the individual.  In many humans the reptilian cortex (agenda: territory and reproduction [in humans that translates to power and sex] is out of control and the amygdala stokes the fear that leads to more bad behavior.  The prefrontal cortex is the key to our future if we can harness its power.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Dowry of Eve 2003, {{ISBN|0-89281-968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F. Bryan |last4=Amoresa |first4=Angel |last5=Yana |first5=Yi-lin  |last6=Postlethwaita |first6=John |date=1999 |title=Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations |journal=Genetics |volume=151 |pages=1531–1545|pmid=10101175 |pmc=1460548 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''watch system,''' '''watch schedule,''' or '''watch bill''' is a method of assigning regular periods of work duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment. A watch system allows the ship's crew to operate the ship 24&amp;nbsp;hours a day for the duration of long voyages or operations.

Many watch systems incorporate the concept of '''dogging''', whereby one watch is split into two shorter watches so that there is an odd number each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Doing so allows crew members to have a different watch schedule each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Often, the [[dog watch]]es are set at dinner time to allow the entire crew to be fed in short order.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

In the traditional [[Royal Navy]] watch system (a system used by most other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies), 'watch' refers to a period of time and to a grouping of personnel. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day – known as 'watch-keepers' – are assigned to one of two watches: the [[Starboard]] or the [[Port (nautical)|Port]] watch.  These can be further divided into two parts, e.g. First Port, Second Starboard. These two watches – or more usually the four parts of watches – alternate in working the following watches:

* First watch: 2000 to 0000&lt;ref name="usni357"&gt;USNI, 1996:357.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Middle watch: 0000 to 0400&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Morning watch: 0400 to 0800&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Forenoon watch: 0800 to 1200&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Afternoon watch: 1200 to 1600&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* First [[dog watch]]: 1600 to 1800&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Last [[dog watch]]: 1800 to 2000&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

The Royal Navy traditional submarine three watch system is 2 on 4 off during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and 3 on 6 off during the night (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).

The same arrangement of watch times can also be used with a crew divided into three sections.  This gives each sailor more time off-duty, sometimes allowing sleeping periods of over seven hours. Names for the three watches—instead of Port and Starboard—vary from ship to ship. Naming schemes such as "[[Foremast]]", "[[Mainmast]]" and "[[Mizzen]]" and "Red", "White" and "Blue" are common.

The "Six-Hour-Shift" splits the day in four 6-hour watches, permitting a three section crew to maximize rest time in a 3-day working cycle. Also, this watch systems takes into better account the meal times (of a 4 meal-a-day system), so that the ingoing team will be fed first, then stand watch, while the outgoing team will be relieved of watch, and then proceed to the messdeck.

Aboard [[United States]] [[submarine]]s, the crew is typically divided into three sections, with each section standing 8 hours of watch followed by 16 hours off-watch. This schedule has been a fairly recent change to submariner work and rest routines. For nearly 45 years prior to 2015, submariners were on 18-hour days with 6 hours of watch followed by 12 hours off watch. The 12 hours off-watch were further divided into the first 6 hours being used for maintenance, cleaning, and entertainment; while the second 6 hours were usually for sleeping.

Note that this arrangement resulted in one of the sections having two watches in one (24-hour) day, and there were no dog watches. Also, watch reliefs occurred no later than the bottom of the hour (2330, 0530, 1130, 1730). Typically, the first 30 minutes of the hour were used for the oncoming section to eat while the second 30 minutes of the hour were used for the off-going section to eat.

Some warships now use the one-in-two system, also known as 7s and 5s, for the duration of the watches.  This gives the sailors a longer sleeping period than the traditional two-watch system, while still maintaining the ability for the ship to function.  Meals are generally scheduled around the watch turnovers at 0700, 1200, and 1700; sometimes a light midnight meal is provided for the 0000 turnover.

Various alternative watch schedules have been devised, which are typically referred to as '''Swedish watches'''.  Although there is no standard for what constitutes a Swedish watch, the variations all feature some element of extended watches to accommodate longer time off. Like the traditional watch system, they begin at 2000&amp;nbsp;hours. Some popular variations have durations of 6, 6, 4, 4, 4 and 5, 5, 5, 5, 4.

On [[merchant ship]]s, watchstanders typically stand watch for three periods of four consecutive hours. This system has a couple of advantages: it is easy to remember and it is consistent. For example, a member of watch team 1 will only have to remember that he is on the "4–8" watch, and knows that he goes on watch at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. This scheme also allows inexperienced watchstanders to stand watch from 8–12&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 8–12&amp;nbsp;p.m., when senior watchstanders are likely to be awake and ready to assist in case of trouble. 

By custom, in a ship with five deck officers the junior third mate takes the 8 to 12 watch, the senior third mate the 12 to 4 watch, and the second mate the 4 to 8 watch. This enables the second officer, who is the ship's navigator, to take morning and evening star sights. In ships with only four deck officers, the third officer will stand the 8 to 12, the second officer the 12 to 4, and the Chief Mate (equivalent to the Executive Officer in a navy ship) the 4 to 8 watch. The reason for this is to enable the Chief Mate to assign work to the deck gang before the ship's day begins, and to inspect it before going on watch at 1600 hours.
