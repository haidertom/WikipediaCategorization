'''ALZA Corporation''' was a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[medical system]]s company.

==Background==
Founded in 1968 by Dr [[Alejandro Zaffaroni]]; the company's name is a [[portmanteau]] of his name.

==Early life==
Latif was born near the city of [[Sylhet]], [[Sylhet District]], [[Sylhet Division]], [[East Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). In 1969, he arrived in the United Kingdom and settled in [[Manchester]]; a racist incident one night persuaded Latif to move north to Newcastle. He was married to Neawarun, with whom he had four daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Career==
Latif's first job on [[Tyneside]] was as a waiter in a restaurant owned by a relative in [[Whitley Bay]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; In 1977, Latif established his restaurant, the Rupali, in the city centre of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The restaurant was later renamed Curry Capital.&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt;

Latif offered free curry for five years to all service men and women who had [[Iraq War|served in Iraq]],&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/2955963.stm|title=Hot offer tempts the troops|work= |location= |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=17 April 2003|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and free curry for life to rugby star [[Jonny Wilkinson]] and football manager [[Graeme Souness]].&lt;ref name="thenorthernecho"&gt;{{cite news |last=Douglas|first=Andrew|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1979610.mostviewed.curry_hell_man_dies.php|title=Restauranteur dies from heart attack|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Northern Echo]]''|date=20 January 2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, his restaurant was also listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', for the world's longest-distance curry delivery{{snd}} when he delivered frozen vegetable biryani and peshwari naan bread from Newcastle to [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]].&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/7200235.stm|title=From curry hell to model citizen|work= |location= |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=21 January 2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delivery was made by motorcycle courier and aircraft and took four days.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; He featured regularly in the cult adult comic ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'', providing the staff with free curries and relishing the publicity, despite their portrayal of him as a "curry mentalist".&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt;

Latif purchased the deed to the honorary title of the Lord of Harpole for £5,000 in 1994, and proudly branded himself as Britain's first Bangladeshi [[Lord of the Manor]].&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt; He ran a website called The New Lord, where he offered souvenir merchandise, seasonal messages to his fans, publicity services and a motivational DVD.&lt;ref name="newlord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlord.co.uk/ |title=The New Lord |publisher= |date= |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127101031/http://www.newlord.co.uk/ |archivedate=27 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was also elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts]] for "his efforts to make a difference in society".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Death==
On 20 January 2008, Latif died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in Newcastle's [[Gosforth]] area.&lt;ref name="bbc2"/&gt; On 2 March 2008, a well-attended memorial event was held at [[Newcastle Civic Centre]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/7199691.stm|title='Curry Hell' restaurant boss dies|work= |location= |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=21 January 2008|accessdate=21 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agile manufacturing''' is a term applied to an organization that has created the processes, tools, and training to enable it to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes while still controlling costs and quality. 

An [[enabling factor]] in becoming an agile manufacturer has been the development of manufacturing support technology that allows the marketers, the designers and the production personnel to share a common database of parts and products, to share data on production capacities and problems&amp;mdash;particularly where small initial problems may have larger ''[[downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]'' effects.  It is a general proposition of manufacturing that the cost of correcting quality issues increases as the problem moves downstream, so that it is cheaper to correct quality problems at the earliest possible point in the process.

Agile manufacturing is seen as the next step after [[lean manufacturing]] in the evolution of production methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one or both. In manufacturing theory, being both is often referred to as leagile.
According to Martin Christopher, when companies have to decide what to be, they have to look at the customer order cycle (COC) (the time the customers are willing to wait) and the leadtime for getting supplies. If the supplier has a short lead time, lean production is possible. If the COC is short, agile production is beneficial.

Agile manufacturing is an approach to manufacturing which is focused on meeting the needs of customers while maintaining high standards of quality and controlling the overall costs involved in the production of a particular product. This approach is geared towards companies working in a highly competitive environment, where small variations in performance and product delivery can make a huge difference in the long term to a company's survival and reputation among consumers.

This concept is closely related to lean manufacturing, in which the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not directly related to the production of a product for the consumer. Agile manufacturing can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using "agile and lean manufacturing".
Companies which utilize an agile manufacturing approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.

Markets can change very quickly, especially in the global economy. A company which cannot adapt quickly to change may find itself left behind, and once a company starts to lose market share, it can fall rapidly. The goal of agile manufacturing is to keep a company ahead of the competition so that consumers think of that company first, which allows it to continue innovating and introducing new products, because it is financially stable and it has a strong customer support base.

Companies that want to switch to the use of agile manufacturing can take advantage of consultants who specialize in helping companies convert and improve existing systems. Consultants can offer advice and assistance which is tailored to the industry a company is involved in, and they usually focus on making companies competitive as quickly as possible with proved agile techniques. There are also a number of textbooks and manuals available with additional information on agile manufacturing techniques and approaches.

'''Captain Alexander '''"'''Sandy'''"''' Allan''' (26 February 1780 – 18 March 1854), was the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[sea captain]] and businessman who founded the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Shipping Line]] in 1819. Rising from [[shoemaker]] to [[shipping magnate]] in little more than thirty years, Allan retired in 1839 having made a fortune and created a [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] dynasty. He is recognised as one of the major contributors to [[Scotland]]'s commercial interests in the early 19th century, and to the establishment of the [[Firth of Clyde]] as an international centre of shipping. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] his [[brig]] ''Jean'' – so named for his wife – held the record for the fastest crossing between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and [[Quebec City]]. Under his five sons, the Allan Line became the world's largest privately owned shipping empire.

==Early life==

Sandy Allan was born at [[Fairlie, North Ayrshire]], the third son of James Allan – a cheerful and well-respected [[carpenter]] on the Fairlie House estate – and his wife Jean Brown (1750–1821), daughter of Gilbert Brown (1708–1774).&lt;ref&gt;Ravenscrag, by Thomas E. Appleton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The life and works of Robert Burns: Volume 1 (1896); Burns, Chambers &amp; Wallace&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the younger sister of [[Agnes Broun|Agnes (Brown) Burns]], the mother of Sandy's famous first cousin, the Scottish bard, [[Robert Burns]], whose family also worked on the Fairlie estate.&lt;ref&gt;The Burns Encyclopedia (1980); Maurice Lindsay&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1786, Robert Burns stayed with the Allans at their cottage while avoiding a writ from James Armour in consequence of his relationship with [[Jean Armour]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Page 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy Allan had expected to become a [[carpenter]], but after his father's death when he was twelve, he was apprenticed to a [[shoemaker]] in [[Kilmarnock]], working ten hours a day, except on Sundays. By 1800, when he was employed as a journeyman shoemaker near [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]], Sandy quit and moved to [[Saltcoats]], intent on learning to be a ship's carpenter. He gave that idea up almost immediately for the chance to go to sea and was soon sailing as mate to Captain John Wilson of Saltcoats. Within a few years, Allan had served as Master and part-owner of several [[Lead ship|first-class ships]] trading out of Saltcoats. In 1806, at [[Saltcoats]], he married Jean Crawford (1782–1856), whose family lived in a small cottage in Castleweerock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~macfie/familyconnections.html Genealogical notes on the Allan family]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Peninsular War]], Captain Allan was master of the 175 [[ton]] [[brigantine]] ''Hero''. It was chartered by the [[British government]] to transport troops, cattle and goods to Spain to supply [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] army. Vessels such as his were usually put under the protection of an armed [[convoy]] to ensure their safety, but Captain Allan grew impatient with the delay that these escorts added to his voyages. It was his practice to separate himself from the protecting [[warships]] and pursue his voyages unaccompanied, therefore making the journey in as short a time as possible. Those vessels which remained under convoy were always held up by the slowest in the group. His trips to Spain, although somewhat hazardous, were successful, and by 1814, Captain Allan had established a reputation for himself as both an excellent mariner and a shrewd businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |title=Alexander Allan – Famous People of East Ayrshire |access-date=23 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014130817/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |archive-date=14 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading with Canada==

Since taking command of the ''Jean'', every spring and [[Fall (season)|fall]], Allan took his [[brig]] from [[Greenock]] to [[Montreal]] and back again. The produce that he exported belonged to dry goods merchants, many of whom had houses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. It was Allan's responsibility as captain of the ship to both navigate across the ocean and sell the cargo on arrival, before purchasing Canadian supplies to be sold back to dry goods merchants in [[Scotland]]. On the outward journey his ship was filled with coal, iron, [[herring]]s, sugar and [[West Indian]] spices. On the return journey he took back wheat, [[peas]], flour, [[potash|pot ashes]] and most importantly, timber.

Captain Allan soon gained a reputation as an adept trader, and he was frequently known to have sold his entire cargo within a few hours of his arrival in [[Greenock]] from [[Montreal]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the ''Jean'' also held the record for the fastest crossing between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and [[Quebec City]]. During this period trade with Canada was still in its infancy, but the route which Allan pioneered between [[Greenock]] and [[Montreal]] would soon become synonymous with the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Line]], only on a far greater scale. By 1819, Allan had bought out his co-owners and the Allan Line, which then consisted of himself and the ''Jean'', was born.

Although [[Glasgow]] furnished most of Allan's outward cargoes, the goods were transferred from there to [[Greenock]], which was the port of loading and discharge for Canadian traders. So as to be better able to conduct his shipping business, Captain Allan moved his family from [[Saltcoats]] to [[Greenock]] in 1824.

==Expansion of the Allan Line==

In the winter of 1824, Captain Allan had the [[brig]] ''Favorite'' built in [[Montreal]], though the materials used to construct it had been sent out from [[Scotland]]. The ship turned out to be appropriately named as it was much in demand as a safe and speedy conveyance, both of goods and passengers. It was in the ''Favourite'' that Captain Allan's first and third sons (James and Bryce) received their [[nautical]] training.

In 1830, the 329 [[ton]] ship ''Canada'' was built for Captain Allan by Robert Steel &amp; Co., of [[Greenock]]. The launch of this 'monster vessel', as she was then regarded, was one of the notable events of the time. Crowds turned out to see her, and her arrival in [[Montreal]] produced quite a sensation there. Captain Allan himself commanded the ''Canada'' while his son James succeeded him in the command of the ''Favorite''.

The superiority of the British-built ship over that of the colonial led Captain Allan to contract with Robert Steel &amp; Co. for another ship, the [[barque]] ''Arabian''. This vessel was built in 1837, and Captain Allan's eldest son, James, was promoted to her command. The ownership of these latter vessels was almost exclusively confined to the Allan family as their need for investors became less necessary. The first voyage of the ''Arabian'' was made from [[Greenock]] to Canada in June 1837, and on her return to the [[Firth of Clyde]] she proceeded to [[Glasgow]], which was now possible as a result of the recently undertaken [[dredging]] operations. The ''Canada'', which was a deeper drafted vessel than the ''Arabian'', was not permitted to ascend the river until the following year, 1838. From this period onwards the terminal port of the inward Clyde-bound ships with general cargo and their outward loading port was Glasgow, and as such Captain Allan and his family made their new home there.

==Captain Allan's Sons==
[[File:The grave of Alexander Allan, shipbuilder, Glasgow Necropolis.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of Alexander and Hugh Allan, shipbuilders, Glasgow Necropolis]]
Vessel after vessel was added to the Allan fleet, and soon Captain Allan's eldest son, '''James (1808–1880)''', retired from the sea to conduct the business of their now extensive shipping line, at [[Glasgow]]. The youngest of Captain Allan's five sons, '''Alexander (1825–1892)''', though still at a young age, joined James in the management of the Glasgow business.

The second son, '''[[Hugh Allan|Hugh (1810–1882)]]''', had at an early age been settled by his father in [[Montreal]] at the office of their shipping agents, where the fourth son, '''[[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew (1822–1901)]]''', would later follow him. Hugh possessed in a high degree the energy of his father, and in Montreal he speedily came to the front, becoming, while yet still young, a partner, and ultimately the head of the firm.

The increase of their fleets enabled the Allans to establish a branch of their service at [[Liverpool]] and a continued presence in the agency was needed there. The third son, '''Bryce (1814–1874)''', who had been in command of one of the ships, withdrew from the sea and took charge of the Liverpool branch.

==Legacy==

With his five sons settled at the terminal ports of their vessels, Captain Sandy Allan retired from active duty in 1839, but still took an active interest in the company. The principal direction of the affairs of the Allan Line now rested with the eldest son, James, later to be overtaken by [[Hugh Allan|Hugh]].

Captain Allan died 18 March 1854, aged 74. In his progress from [[shoemaker]] to [[seaman]], ship's mate to [[shipping magnate]], he had made his fortune and established a dynasty. At the same time, he had done a great deal for Scotland's commercial interests and for the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] as a shipping centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |title=Alexander Allan – Famous People of East Ayrshire |access-date=23 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014130817/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |archive-date=14 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did live to see the initial step which ended in the substitution of [[steamships]] for [[sailing ship]]s in the Allan's Canadian trade, but it needed the courage and skill of the second generation to effect the change. When the proposition was first made, the old captain gravely shook his head and warned his sons to take care.

In 1854, the first Allan [[steamship]], the ''Canadian'' was launched at [[Dumbarton]]. This was speedily followed by three others, also constructed by Dennys of Dumbarton – the ''Indian'', ''Anglo-Saxon'' and ''North American''. The two first-named steamers were profitably employed by the [[British government]] during the [[Crimean War]]. In peace, they settled down to the trade for which they were built, the Canadian mail service, the first of the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers]]. The service, subsidised by the [[Government of Canada]], was at first fortnightly in summer and monthly in winter before becoming weekly all the year round five years later.

In 2011 the company changed its name to Dalai Editore and "Baldini &amp; Castoldi" became a series of Dalai Editore. Dalai Editore closed down in 2013. The name "Baldini&amp;Castoldi" still lives on thanks to the effort of a new publishing house, simply named "Baldini&amp;Castoldi".

'''Bernardus Cornelis Johannes Lievegoed''' (2 September 1905, [[Medan]] – 12 December 1992, [[Zeist]]) was a Dutch medical doctor, psychiatrist and author. He is most famous for establishing a theory of organizational development. He founded the N.P.I., or Netherlands Pedagogical Institute, which works with organizations and individuals to help these realize their economic, social and cultural goals. He also founded the Vrije Hogeschool in [[Driebergen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vrijehogeschool.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bernard Lievegoed was born in [[Medan]], [[Sumatra]] (then the [[Dutch East Indies]]) in 1905. At nine, his family moved for three years to [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. From 1917-22, Lievegoed attended high school in [[Java (island)|Java]]. In 1924, he began a study of medicine in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], taking a doctorate in 1928. In this same year he first became aware of [[anthroposophical]] remedial education; this encounter was to play a large role in his further development. In 1930 he completed the medical degree in Amsterdam and became a general practitioner in [[Bosch (Netherlands)|Bosch]] in Duin (near [[Zeist]]).

In 1931 Lievegoed founded the Zonnehuis,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zonnehuizenveldheimstenia.nl&lt;/ref&gt; a home for children with disabilities, in Bosch in Duin. The Zonnehuis was later relocated to Zeist and, in the course of its expansion its name was changed to the ''Zonnehuizen Veldheim Steinia te Zeist''. Lievegoed was the director of this institution from its founding until 1954.

In 1932 Lievegoed helped to found the Vrije School (free [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]]) of Zeist. In 1939 he did a higher doctorate (promotion) with a thesis about the therapeutic use of music. In 1946 he published the first of a number of books, ''Ontwikkelingsfasen van het kind''; this was translated into eight languages and appeared in English as ''Phases of Childhood''.

From 1948-1953 Lievegoed was a consultant for assistance to uneducated working-class children. During this time he published ''Planetenwirken und Lebensprozesse in Mensch und Erde'' (''Planetary Influences and Life Processes in the Human Being and the Earth''). In 1952 he cofounded the Vrij Geestesleven publishing house, oriented towards publishing works related to [[spiritual science]]. He became a member of the national commission on technical high schools; he served in this capacity until 1962.

In 1954 he founded the institution that became his life-work, the NPI. The original name, the Dutch Pedagogic Institute for Economics, was later changed to NPI: Institute for Organizational Development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npi.eu&lt;/ref&gt; He led this institute (in Zeist) for the next 17 years publishing ''The Developing Organisation'' in 1969 (published in English by Tavistock in 1973) with colleagues in the firm, notably Hans von Sasson, arguably the first influential European book on organisation development (.&lt;ref&gt;Foreword by Ronnie Lessem in the 1991 Blackwell edition&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he became extraordinary professor for social pedagogy at the Dutch Economic College (now [[Erasmus University]] in [[Rotterdam]]. In 1961 he helped to found a new technical college in Twente (now Twente University), which opened in 1964. Here he served as professor of social economics and Dean of the Economics Department until 1973. During this time he supported the work of the ''Kind en Instrument'' Foundation, out of which the international Choroi instrument-making workshops arose, and founded an association for therapeutic educators. With his colleagues in NPI he developed [[Theory U]], which later developed as an influential management concept popularized by [[Otto Scharmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Senge, Peter M., Scharmer, C. Otto, Jaworski, Joseph, Flowers, Betty Sue, 2004, ''Presence: An Exploration of Profound Change in People, Organizations, and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1976 Lievegoed was chair of a governmental commission on education that was given the task of transforming the educational system in the Netherlands. During this time he published a number of works (titles are given in approximate English translation): ''Organizational Development'', ''Social Structures in Therapeutic Education'', ''The Spiritual Impulse behind the Movement for Therapeutic Education'', ''Towards the 21st Century'' and, together with his wife Nel Lievegoed-Schatborn, ''Aspects of Therapeutic Education''. In 1971 he founded an independent university, the Vrije Hogeschool, in Driebergen. He was Dean of the University for the next eleven years.

In 1973 he left Erasmus University to cofound and become the managing director of the ''Vrije Pedagogisch Akademie'', now ''Hogeschool Helicon'' (Helicon College). Over the next years, he published several more books: ''Phases'' (''De levensloop van de mens'', translated into eleven languages), ''Mystery Streams in Europe and the New Mysteries'', and ''Organic Architecture''. He joined the governmental commission on [[alternative medicine]] (1977–1981).

In 1983 Lievegoed published a play (''De wadlopers'', ''The Marsh-Flats'') and another book, ''Man on the Threshold: Possibilities and Problems of Inner Development''. He received the [[Gouden Ganzenveer]] honoring his cultural contributions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Further publications: ''Contemplations on the Foundation Stone'' (1987), ''About Cultural Institutions'' (1988), ''Through the Eye of the Needle'' (1991) and ''About the Salvation of the Soul'' (published posthumously in 1993).

Lievegoed died on 12 December 1992 in Zeist.

'''Bestshoring''', also known as rightshoring, is the process of identifying the best location to move [[manufacturing]], [[Information technology|IT]] or [[business]] processes for a company. The decision is to be based on quantifiable criteria which are intended to take subjective and [[political]] input out of the [[decision cycle]]. Many companies use external [[consulting firm]]s to make these decisions.

On August 1, 2004, [[Hillary Clinton]] wrote an article explaining why bestshoring beats [[outsourcing]]. Her argument is that "[[Foreign labor]] isn't as cheap as it seems."

The ''candidatus mercaturae'' (cand.merc. for short) is a 2-year MSc programme on top of the BSc ''Handelsvidenskabelig Afgangseksamen'' (HA for short), so a person holding a cand.merc title has studied at a university for at least 5 years (3 years as an undergraduate/college student, and 2 years in graduate school). Both the undergraduate and the graduate programs are offered as combination programs including other scientific fields, such as computer science, psychology, math, philosophy etc.

Colon]] worked in the coffee industry of Puerto Rico since 1925, for example. There are two other experimental coffee growing projects taking place in the United States in Santa Barbara, CA and in Georgia.

==History==
[[File:Samuel Ruggles.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Samuel Ruggles brought coffee to the Kona District in 1828]]
[[Don Francisco de Paula Marin|Don Francisco de Paula y Marin]] recorded in his
journal dated January 21, 1813, that he had planted coffee seedlings on the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], but not much is known of the fate of that planting.
John Wilkinson, a gardener who came on {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}} in 1825 under [[George Byron, 7th Baron Byron|Captain Lord Byron]], brought coffee plants from Brazil. Governor [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]] provided some land in the [[Manoa|Mānoa Valley]] on O{{okina}}ahu. However, Wilkinson died in March 1827, and the trees did not thrive. Some cuttings were taken to other areas around [[Honolulu]]. Some plants from Manila were also grown by [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]], the British [[consul (representative)|Consul]].&lt;ref name="all"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uwKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA63 |chapter=History of Coffee in Hawaii |title=All about Hawaii |pages=63–68 |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More trees were set out in the Kalihi and Niu valleys near Honolulu, in 1828 or 1829. On the island of Hawaii Rev. Joseph Goodrich tried planting some coffee to make the [[Waiakea Mission Station-Hilo Station|Hilo mission]] self-sustaining. Goodrich planted gardens over his 12 years at Hilo, and taught classes for native Hawaiians on cultivation of both for cash to support the mission, as well as vegetables and tropical fruits for their own meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10524/84 |title=Sandwich Island Missionaries: The First American Point Four Agents |author=Merze Tate |work=Annual report of the Hawaiian Historical Society |year=1962 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Samuel Ruggles (1795–1871) carried some cuttings of coffee to the Kona District when he was transferred from Hilo on the eastern side of the island of Hawaii to the [[Kealakekua Church]] on the western side in July 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Portraits of American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii |author= Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |url= https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00hawarich |year=1901 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Hawaiian gazette co. |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would take time to get established, this area would be the most successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to Old Kona |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btEuhAXQOQkC |author=Kona Historical Society |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8248-2010-7 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Nicholas Greenwell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pioneer coffee merchant [[Henry Nicholas Greenwell]] (1826–1891)]] 
Early commercial ventures on the [[Kauai|island of Kaua{{okina}}i]] in 1836 and 1845 ended in failure. The first records of production were made in 1845, of only 248 pounds, grown on Kaua{{okina}}i and Hawaii island.  The [[great Mahele]] in 1848 allowed private ownership of land for the first time.
Large areas were once grown on Maui, but were replaced by [[sugarcane]] and other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=All about coffee |author=William Harrison Ukers |pages=239–241 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4O_RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |publisher=The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Company |year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Scale insect]]s infected many of the coffee trees on the other islands.
The slopes in the Kona area were unsuitable for [[sugarcane]], so the area became the center for the coffee industry in Hawaii. To be called [[Kona coffee]], it must be grown in this district only.

In 1873, the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|world's fair in Vienna]] awarded Kona trader [[Henry Nicholas Greenwell]] an award for excellence, which gave some recognition to the "Kona" name. Around 1880 John Gaspar, Sr. (Married to Maria Rice Santos), built the first coffee mill in Hawaii near [[Kealakekua Bay]]. In 1892 the ''Guatemalan'' variety was introduced to Hawaii by German planter [[Hermann A. Widemann]].&lt;ref name="goto"/&gt; Also about this time [[Coccinellidae|lady bugs]] (also called ladybird beetles) were able to control the scale infestation.&lt;ref name="cup"/&gt;

When the United States annexed Hawaii in 1898 (forming the [[territory of Hawaii]]), the dropping of tariffs meant sugar was even more profitable, and some coffee trees were torn up. Prices dropped in 1899 and 1900, which wiped out some remaining plantations.
In 1916, production was about 2.7 million pounds, while sugar continued to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Commerce reports, Volume 4 |publisher=United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce |page=470 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3xMpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 |year=1917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[World War I]] in 1917 and a severe frost in Brazil in 1918 caused a world shortage, and prices rose.&lt;ref name="cup"&gt;{{cite book | title= A cup of aloha: the Kona coffee epic |author= Gerald Kinro |page=123 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wyw0JEuokwsC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA123&amp;pg=RA1-PA123 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-8248-2678-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese laborers from [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s would often start small farms in Kona after their employment contracts expired.&lt;ref name="goto"&gt;{{cite news |hdl=10524/432 |title=Ethnic Groups and the Coffee Industry in Hawaii |author=Baron Goto |year=1982 |volume=16 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages= 112–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1922 most coffee production in Hawaii had disappeared except in the Kona district. The [[great Depression]] of the 1930s depressed prices, and caused many farmers to default on their debts. After [[World War II]], and another frost in South America, prices rose again in the 1950s. Production peaked in 1957 at over 18 million pounds.&lt;ref name="cup"/&gt;

By the 1970s, the tourism industry competed for labor, and production declined.
The closing of the sugar and pineapple plantations in the 1990s provided a slow resurgence in the coffee industry.

==Modern production==
The "coffee belt" in Kona is approximately two miles wide from {{convert|700|ft}} to {{convert|2000|ft}} elevation. Other districts on the island where coffee is grown include [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū]]  in the far south, [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]] in the southeast, and [[Hamakua|Hāmākua]] in the northeast.&lt;ref name="county"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/bigislandag/coffee.html |title= Agriculture - coffee |publisher= County of Hawaii |work= official web site |year=1998 |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although coffee can be harvested year-round in Hawaii, highest production begins in late summer and extends to early spring. In the 2008–2009 season, there were about 790 farms on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]], and 40 on other islands. Average yield was equivalent to 1400 pounds of parchment per acre. A total of about {{convert|7800|acre}} are planted with coffee throughout the state. A little over half the acreage is outside the island of Hawaii, in particular on the island of [[Kauai]], indicating that farms on other islands are larger in average size compared to those on Hawaii.  Although total production increased from 2007 to about 8.6 million pounds, farm prices actually dropped, so the dollar value decreased by about 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Hawaii/Publications/Sugarcane_and_Specialty_Crops/coffee.pdf |title= Hawaii Coffee |accessdate=2009-11-04 |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |date= September 3, 2009 |author= National Agricultural Statistics Service Hawaii Field Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Due to the relatively few coffee farms in Kauai, Maui and Honolulu counties their numbers are combined in USDA statistics to avoid disclosure of individual operations in those counties.)
Several former sugarcane and [[pineapple]] plantations have changed to coffee production, such as [[Molokai coffee|Moloka{{okina}}i coffee]].

A third meeting was hosted by the Hong Kong Companies Registry held in [[Hong Kong]] in 2006 and it was agreed that the Corporate Registers Forum would be registered under the Hong Kong Business Ordinance as an [[unincorporated entity]].

The fourth meeting was held in April 2007.  This meeting was jointly hosted by the Companies Commission of [[Malaysia]] and the Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority of [[Singapore]]

A fifth meeting was held in April 2008 and was hosted by Corporations [[Canada]] in [[Vancouver]].

The sixth meeting was held in 2009 [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] and was hosted by the Companies and Intellectual Property Registration Office of [[South Africa]] (CIPRO).

[[File:Eriesky2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Downtown Erie skyline]]
'''Downtown Erie''', is the central business, cultural and government center for the city of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], United States. 
Erie’s Central Business District includes [[Gannon University]], [[UPMC Hamot|UPMC Hamot hospital]], [[Erie Insurance]], and city and county government offices, as well as other non-government related commercial retail and office development.  Nearly 20,000 people work in downtown Erie. As of 2000, 2,690 people lived downtown. 

==Location==
Downtown Erie is a 70 block area. From the foot of State Street to 14th Street (North and South), and from Holland Street to Sassafras Street (East and West).

==Transportation==
*'''Trolley-''' Downtown is served by the EMTA's Bay Liner trolley system, a free trolley service that travels from the foot of State Street to 14th Street. 
*'''Taxi-''' The Erie Cab Co. runs seven days a week. Erie taxis are permitted to pick up passengers in response to a street hail.
*'''Bus-''' The EMTA's buses runs seven days a week in the city.  

==Downtown Districts==
Downtown Erie is divided into 3 different areas, Bayfront district,downtown center city and midtown.

===Bayfront District===
Bayfront district is home to much of downtown’s employers. It is home to Gannon University, UPMC Hamot hospital, and [[Erie Insurance]]. The Bayfront district is also where the [[Bayfront Convention Center]] and Sheraton Hotel are located. The Blasco Library, [[Erie Maritime Museum]], [[Erie Art Museum]], restaurants, bars and marinas are all located in the Bayfront district.

===Center City===
[[Image:Erie, Pennsylvania 1922.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown in the 1920s]]
Center City is where many of the Erie’s high rise buildings are located. The [[Renaissance Centre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Renaissance Centre]] is Erie’s tallest building. Located in the center city are: The Boston Store, The [[Warner Theatre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Warner Theatre]], [[Erie Insurance Arena]], [[UPMC Park]], [[Perry Square]], restaurants, bars and night clubs as well as many retail shops. Center city is also home to 14 banks. Also located in the center city is Gannon University, as well [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Erie|St. Peter's Cathedral]]. The cathedral is the city's largest structure, standing 265 feet (81 m) tall.

===Midtown===
Midtown, located from 12th to 14th streets, is where the old US Post Office at Griswold Plaza, [[Union Station (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Union Station]], as well as nightclubs, restaurants, and residential apartments, are located. As of fall 2009, Midtown renovations of the five-story Mercantile Building and Griswold Plaza are complete.  Additionally, a townhouse development is planned. The name "Midtown" is actually only a real estate term to brand the area for redevelopment. Erie's actual and traditional Midtown begins four blocks south of this area, from 18th Street/Former Norfolk Southern tracks to 26th Street.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Downtown redevelopment== 
The Erie Redevelopment Authority made a master plan to redevelop the entire downtown area. As of fall 2009 the first phase was nearly complete.  The first phase was the redevelopment of midtown. Other redevelopments of the downtown include: a $42 million renovation to the Erie Insurance Arena, streetscape improvements to 12th street, facade improvements to many downtown buildings, new building and retail development and new townhouses and residential condos along the bayfront bluffs.

Absent filing the form, a default classification applies. U.S. corporations of the type that can be publicly traded must be treated as corporations. There is a list of specific foreign entities that must be treated as corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/301.7701-2 26 CFR 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt; The election is effective for Federal and most [[state income tax]] purposes.

If an entity is not classified as a corporation, it is treated as a [[partnership]] for U.S. tax purposes if it has more than one owner, or is a [[disregarded entity]] if it has a single owner (i.e. is treated as part of the single owner).

The classification of either a U.S. or non-U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes has no effect for purposes other than U.S. income tax.

==Eligibility to make an election==
An entity, which is eligible to make an election, is referred to as an '''eligible entity'''. Generally, a corporation organized under U.S. federal or state statute (and referred to as a corporation, body corporate or body politic by that statute) is not an eligible entity. However, the following [[types of business entity]] are treated as eligible entities:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
#An eligible entity that previously elected to be an association taxable as a corporation by filing Form 8832. An entity that elects to be classified as a corporation by filing Form 8832 can make another election to change its classification, subject to the 60-month limitation rule.
#A foreign eligible entity that became an association taxable as a corporation under the foreign default rule [[#Default classification|described below]].
#A foreign corporation that is not identified as a corporation under [[Treasury regulations]] §301.7701-2(b)(8). If a foreign corporation is not identified on the list included in these regulations, it qualifies as an eligible entity.

The list of foreign entities classified as corporations for federal tax purposes (so called ''per se'' corporations, not eligible to make an entity classification election) includes, as of September 2009:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=8610f90436ab33d90321c10e793c8f1e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.2&amp;idno=26 Treasury regulations §301.7701-2](b)(8); latest amendment T.D. 9462, 74 FR 46904, Sept. 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the IRS added a  Croatian dionicko drustvo to the list of per se corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Notice 2013-44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Div col end}}

==Default classification==
An eligible entity is classified for federal tax purposes under the default rules described below unless it files Form 8832 or Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation, to elect a classification or change its current classification. The IRS uses the information entered on the form to establish the entity's filing and reporting requirements for federal tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Instructions"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf IRS Form 8832: Entity Classification Election]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain domestic and foreign entities that were in existence before January 1, 1997, and have an established federal tax classification generally do not need to make an election to continue that classification. If an existing entity decides to change its classification, it may do so subject to the 60-month limitation rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=8610f90436ab33d90321c10e793c8f1e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.4&amp;idno=26 Treasury regulations §301.7701-3](b)(3) and (h)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a domestic eligible entity will be classified by default as:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
# A partnership if it has two or more members.
# Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner. A change in the number of members of an eligible entity classified as an association (defined below) does not affect the entity's classification. However, an eligible entity classified as a partnership will become a disregarded entity when the entity's membership is reduced to one member and a disregarded entity will be classified as a partnership when the entity has more than one member.

Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a foreign eligible entity will be classified by default as:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
# A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have [[limited liability]].
# An association taxable as a corporation if all members have limited liability.
# Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability.

The effect of these rules is that a U.S. [[limited liability company]] (LLC) or [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP) is treated by default as a partnership (or disregarded entity if it has only one owner), whereas a foreign LLP is treated by default as a corporation (if, as is generally the case, all its members have limited liability).

If an entity has been operating under one classification for some time, but then elects to change its classification, there may be tax consequences. The initial regulations were unclear on this point, so the IRS issued Revenue Rulings 99-5 and 99-6 in 1999 to address questions surrounding the conversion of an LLC to a partnership and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciremagazine.com/article.php?article_id=476 Clarifying Entity Classification Conversions], Steven M. Friedman &amp; Samuel H. Hoppe, Commercial Investment Real Estate Magazine, July/August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in international tax planning==
The "check-the-box" regulations paved the way for various new [[tax avoidance]] and [[tax deferral]] strategies.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/law/lawreview/taxjournal/atj20/docs/Sweitzer201.pdf Analyzing Subpart F in light of Check-the-Box], Cynthia Ram Sweitzer, Akron Tax Journal 20, March 2005. See pp. 9-11, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they expanded the opportunity for "hybrid branch" or "hybrid entity" strategies, which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions, in order to engage in cross-border tax arbitrage. The possibility that the check-the-box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation, and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all; however, in the end, the IRS, while acknowledging such concerns, issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

US owners of foreign subsidiaries benefit from the ability to have those foreign subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities. Under the United States' [[Internal Revenue Code]] Subpart F, payments between related [[Controlled Foreign Corporation]]s (CFCs), or from American companies to related CFCs, may be "treated as Subpart F income" (subject to current taxation as if they were profits in the hands of the ultimate American owner of the corporate structure), in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to [[tax deferral|defer US tax]] on the income of foreign corporations they control. However, payments between an American-owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation, and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity, are not treated as Subpart F income.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFO"&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/13638941?f=most_read 'Unchecking the Box' Could Lead to Fierce Debate], CFO Magazine, May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non-American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other, e.g. through [[thin capitalisation|thin capitalization]].&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt; Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check-the-box regulations consists of US [[flow-through entity|flow-through entities]] ([[S corporation]]s and partnerships) with foreign subsidiaries. If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation, the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a [[foreign tax credit]] for the US owner under Section 902. However, with a check-the-box election to be treated as a disregarded entity, the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner, thus giving rise to the tax credit.&lt;ref name="Patelski"&gt;"[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5448479/Check-the-box-not-always.html Check-the-Box: Not Always the Right Answer for Certain Foreign Corporations]". Robert Patelski, The Tax Adviser 37(4), April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=ae4faff263908179cc70a6733c575de7&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:9.0.1.1.1.0.11.189&amp;idno=26 Internal revenue regulations §1.902]&lt;/ref&gt;

For US owners with foreign subsidiaries, choosing to have a subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity is not always the most beneficial tax-planning choice, however. For example, if a US taxpayer owns a disregarded foreign entity, its income will be taxed at the owner's ordinary US income tax rates, less the foreign tax already paid. This may result in every marginal dollar being taxed at the highest rate. However, if the foreign entity had elected to be taxed as a corporation (or been classified as such by default), paid a low rate tax in the foreign country, then repatriated its income to the US by paying [[qualified dividends]] to its owner, the total proportion of tax paid on income might actually be less, as qualified dividends are only taxed at 15%. However, this treatment is only available for dividends from corporations in certain countries, and is set to sunset in 2010 under the [[Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005]].&lt;ref name="Patelski"/&gt;

Foreign owners of US corporations also benefit from the ability to have entities normally treated as flow-through instead be taxed as corporations by the IRS. In what is sometimes known as a "domestic reverse hybrid" strategy, a non-US corporation may set up a US holding company which elects to be treated as a corporation for US tax purposes, but which its home country tax law sees as a [[flow-through entity]]. The US holding company receives a loan from its home country parent which it invests in a US operating subsidiary; the US holding company receives dividends from the US operation subsidiary and pays interest to the non-US parent. US tax law thus sees a US company making a dividend payment to another US company (which is thus not subject to withholding tax, unlike a dividend paid to a foreign company) which then pays interest to a foreign company, while the home country tax law will see a US company paying dividends directly to its home country parent. Under typical treaties for the relief of [[double taxation]], neither government has the right to tax the payment, because each sees it as a type of payment which only the other has the right to tax.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1996, whether domestic and foreign entities were classified as corporations was based on a six-factor test which looked at:&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2221&amp;context=bclr One Nation Among Many: Policy Implications of Cross-Border Tax Arbitrage], Diane M. Ring, Boston College Law Review 44(1), December 1, 2002. See pp. 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;
#limited liability;
#continuity of life;
#free transferability of interests;
#centralized management;
#associates;
#objective to carry on business for joint profit

An entity which had a preponderance of the first four factors (the last two, in practice, were shared by all business entities) was treated as a corporation, otherwise as a partnership or an association.&lt;ref name="IRM"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-061-005.html Internal Revenue Manual, Part 4. Examining Process, Chapter 61. LMSB International Program Audit Guidelines, Section 5. Entity Classification], Internal Revenue Service, May 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, this test was easily manipulated.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

The "check-the-box" regulations (Treasury Decision 8697) were adopted in 1996 in order to simplify the issue of entity classification. A [[grandfather clause]] allowed entities in existence on May 8, 1996 to continue using their previous classification, even if they would no longer be eligible to elect that classification under the new rules.&lt;ref name="PMS"&gt;[http://pmstax.com/part/bull9612.shtml Internal Revenue Service Adopts "Check-the-Box" Classification Regulations], Partnership Tax Bulletin, [[Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman]], December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There were three conditions for this grandfathering:&lt;ref name="IRM"/&gt;
#the entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for its claimed classification;
#the entity and all owners recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in classification within 60 months prior to January 1, 1997; and
#neither the entity nor its owners had been advised that the entity was under examination on or before May 8, 1996.

The initial regulations also included a list of foreign entities which would always be classified as corporations ("per-se corporations") and which could not elect to be disregarded.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt; The proposed regulations included [[naamloze vennootschap]] formed under the laws of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles in that list, but they were removed from the final list; conversely, Canadian corporations were added to the list.&lt;ref name="PMS"/&gt;

In 1998, the IRS issued Notice 98-11, 1998-1 C.B. 433 in an attempt to combat the use of "check-the-box" in international tax planning (see below); however, the notice met opposition, and was withdrawn by Notice 98-35, 1998-2 C.B. 34.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt; Another proposal, around 1999, would have left the basic check-the-box regime in place, but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with "extraordinary transactions" (where the tax liability changes "significantly" as a result of the election).&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt; An "extraordinary transaction" was defined as one in which there was a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored, and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation, if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction.&lt;ref name="TEI"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Comments+on+changes+in+entity+classification:+special+rule+for...-a063639840 Comments on changes in entity classification: special rule for certain foreign eligible entities.] Tax Executive, April 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, various tax professionals opposed the changes, arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low, and that existing internal revenue regulations, as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of [[substance over form]] and the [[step transaction doctrine]], were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check-the-box rules.&lt;ref name="TEI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Entity+classification+simplification+not+that+simple-a062281367 Entity classification simplification not that simple], Shawn Carson &amp; John Santa Maria, The Tax Adviser, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] attempted to revive the IRS' 1998 notice in his proposed 2010 budget.&lt;ref name="CFO"/&gt; Specifically, the proposal stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/grnbk09.pdf General Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2010 Revenue Proposals], Department of the Treasury, May 2009. See p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Reform business entity classification rules for foreign entities:''' Under the proposal, a foreign eligible entity may be treated as a disregarded entity only if the single owner of the foreign eligible entity is created or organized in, or under the law of, the foreign country in, or under the law of, which the foreign eligible entity is created or organized. Therefore, a foreign eligible entity with a single owner that is organized or created in a country other than that of its single owner would be treated as a corporation for federal tax purposes. Except in cases of U.S. tax avoidance, the proposal would generally not apply to a first-tier foreign eligible entity wholly owned by a United States person. The tax treatment of the conversion to a corporation of a foreign eligible entity treated as a disregarded entity would be consistent with current Treasury regulations and relevant tax principles.}}

The proposal was eventually dropped again due to criticism from businesses, and it was not included again in the 2011 budget proposal either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/Tax_2011ObamaBudget_LF_02feb10.pdf Obama’s 2011 Budget: Check-the-Box off the Table; Subpart F Expanded] Morgan Lewis Tax Flash, February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3277">On July 26, 2010, the [[European Commission]] announced&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/1006&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en&lt;/ref&gt; two separate antitrust investigations against [[IBM|International Business Machines (IBM)]]. Both cases were related to alleged abuse of IBM's dominant position in the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] market. The first case followed complaints by mainframe emulator vendors T3 Technologies and TurboHercules, later joined by Neon Enterprise Software, and focused on the alleged tying of IBM's mainframe hardware to its mainframe operating system, potentially precluding customers from the execution of mission critical mainframe applications on non-IBM servers. The second case was an investigation begun on the EC's own initiative that looked into IBM's alleged discriminatory behaviour towards competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services.

In its initial reaction&lt;ref&gt;http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/64143&lt;/ref&gt; to the EC's decision, IBM said that the allegations had been brought forward by "satellite proxies" of rival [[Microsoft]]. (Microsoft was the subject of [[European Union Microsoft competition case|an epic series of EU antitrust cases]].
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9131633/IBM_Adobe_Oracle_join_EU_antitrust_case_against_Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9057180/Update_EU_launches_two_new_antitrust_probes_against_Microsoft?taxonomyId=144&amp;pageNumber=2&lt;/ref&gt;)
IBM also noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/27blue.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=todayspaper|title=Europe to Investigate Antitrust Complaints Over I.B.M. Mainframes|author=Kevin O'Brien|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the company holds numerous U.S. [[patents]] (some of which have also been filed in Europe) on its mainframe hardware technologies to protect its ongoing billions of dollars in new mainframe technology investments, that the vendors did not seek and did not pay for licenses to those patents, and that IBM should not be required to support infringement of its own patents.

== Resolution ==

After losing related court cases in the U.S. against IBM, T3 and Neon withdrew their European Commission complaints in August, 2011. TurboHercules also withdrew its complaint.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/03/ibm_eu_mainframe_complaints_dropped/&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2011, the European Commission closed its investigation without action into alleged operating system and hardware tying. Separately, IBM agreed to provide mainframe spare parts and certain technical information for five years to maintenance firms. The Commission provisionally approved of IBM's proposed solution and, after a comment period, issued final approval in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-14/ibm-settles-european-union-antitrust-dispute-over-mainframes-1-.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Aoife | last=White | title=IBM Settles European Union Antitrust Dispute Over Mainframes | date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Friedrich Gajewski''' (born 13 October 1885 in [[Pillau]] – died 2 December 1965 in [[Cologne]]) was a [[Germany|German]] businessman with [[IG Farben]] and ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' (war industry leader) during the [[Second World War]].

==Early years==
One of twelve children, Gajewski only had limited schooling due to his family's lack of money but, following the completion of an apprenticeship as a pharmacist, he was able to enrol in the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1905 to study chemistry and pharmacy. He completed his doctorate in 1910 and served for a year in the military, as was mandatory at the time.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/friedrich_fritz_gajewski_18851965 Friedrich (Fritz) Gajewski (1885–1965)]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered civilian employment in 1912 with [[BASF]] but returned to the [[German Imperial Army]] in 1914, serving in the [[First World War]] until 1917.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; He was recalled to manage the BASF gas works at [[Ludwigshafen-Oppau]] and around this time he married Elisabeth Seckler, eventually fathering two daughters.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Career at IG Farben==
Gajewski first came to prominence at IG Farben in 1925 when he was appointed assistant to [[Carl Bosch]] and a director of the company in 1925.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; His career at the company was concentrated on photographic products, with Gajewski appointed  technical director of [[Agfa]] in 1928 and head of IG Farben's Product Division III (photographic supplies, artificial silk and cellulose-based products) two years later, whilst he was also made a full member of IG Farben's managing board in 1932.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; These roles required him to work closely with [[Dynamit Nobel]] and as such he was on that company's supervisory board from 1936 until 1945.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Under the Nazis==
Gajewski became a member of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; Gajewski demonstrated his support for the Nazi ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' during an incident in late 1938 involving a former colleague at IG Farben. Gerhard Ollendorf, a Jew, had been a member of the board in the early 1930s but had fallen afoul of Nazi laws and in November 1938 told Gajewski that he intended to leave Germany. Although Gajewski wished him luck he immediately wrote to the [[Gestapo]], informing them that Ollendorf was in possession of sensitive information and that it would not be wise to allow him to leave. Ollendorf was prevented from leaving until eventually Gajewski relented and endorsed his departure.&lt;ref name="Jeff191"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

His role as a member of the company's South-East Europe Committee, a post he took up in 1940, made him a regular visitor to IG Farben sites that had been established in occupied and satellite territories such as [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; His position as a ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' was confirmed in 1942.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Post-war==
Gajewski was arrested by the [[US Army]] on 5 October 1945. He was brought before the [[IG Farben trial]] in 1947 and, although the case saw details of his denouncing of Jewish members of IG Farben's managing board following the Nazi takeover, he was nonetheless acquitted of war crimes.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; Indeed, Gerhard Ollendorf had initially written an [[affidavit]] in defence of Gajewski, who he believed had aided his departure from Germany, but he withdrew the statement after Gajewski's letter to the Gestapo was discovered and read out in court.&lt;ref name="Jeff191"/&gt;

He returned to the business world with Dynamit Nobel, becoming chairman of the company in 1952 and was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Großes Verdienstkreuz]] the following year by the [[West Germany|West German]] government.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; He also chaired the boards at Genschow &amp; Co. and Chemie-Verwaltungs AG as well as holding board membership at two other companies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1957 and ended his days in the Hahnwald suburb of Cologne.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''George Eames Barstow''' (1849–1924), described as a "capitalist and irrigation pioneer," was a Texas land developer and a member of both the [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Providence City Council|common council]] (four years) and the city's [[school board]] (fourteen years), as well as the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives|State Assembly]] from 1894 to 1896.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt; He was known as "the father of irrigation in the [[Southwest United States|Southwest]]."&lt;ref name=LAT19090202&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/159320608/ "May Go Haying in Automobile," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 2, 1909, page 14] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

Barstow began his business career at the age of seventeen and eventually "founded, financed or organized" five [[worsted]] and [[paper industry|paper mills]] in Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

He then turned his attention to the [[Pecos River|Pecos Valley]] in Texas, where the Pioneer Canal Company was chartered on September 30, 1889, with Barstow as treasurer. He later served as president of a successor company, the Pecos Valley Land and Irrigation Company.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

In 1891 Barstow and other land developers formed a project to promote a town on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] in western [[Ward County, Texas]].  By 1895 the town had taken on  the name of [[Barstow, Texas|Barstow]], and Barstow himself moved there from New York City in 1904. He took part  in organizing other irrigation and drainage systems through [[Western United States|the West]].&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

==Volunteer work==

Barstow, a Republican, wrote pamphlets on varied subjects, including immigration, cooperatives, China-Japan relations and [[Culture of the United States|Americanism]].&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

===Irrigation and immigration===

In 1908–09 Barstow was the president of the [[National Irrigation Congress]], the leading organization interested in water projects in the West, and he was in charge of the annual convention in 1909 in Spokane, Washington. A ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter wrote about the impending congress that Barstow "has been a prime mover in inducing the federal government to build the systems that will make fertile over 3,000,000 acres of land which once was a desert." In an interview, Barstow predicted that isolated farmhouses would become "a thing of the past" and that farmers would commute from their homes to farms via fast horses or automobiles or interurban streetcars.&lt;ref name=LAT19090202/&gt;   He added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The government is laying out towns every five miles. . . . The farms will be small, ten to forty acres, and the farming intensive. Under these circumstances, the farmers will live in  towns of 1500 to 2000 people, enjoying all the benefits of urban life — schools, churches and social life. . . . A tide from the city to the country has already set in. Many college graduates have chosen farming on irrigated tracts for their life work.&lt;ref name=LAT19090202/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his opening speech at the Spokane congress, Barstow urged the government to find work for (overseas) immigrants "[[Western United States|out West]]," to provide them with transportation and to lend them money to establish homes.&lt;ref name=NYT19090814&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/08/14/101037924.pdf "Jobs for Immigrants," ''New York Times,'' August 14, 1909] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shall I, who have always been broadly conservative, be regarded as preaching paternalism or as socialistic in my purpose when suggesting that the duty of the National  Government may be found in providing under proper safeguard a fund which may be used to make loans of suitable amount to enable this thrifty and frugal class of people to locate their homes . . . ?&lt;ref name=NYT19090814/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barstow was head of the [[National Immigration Commission]] in 1912, and he sent a message to the first convention of the [[American Immigration and Distribution League]] in New York City in April of that year "stating that 65 per cent. of the immigrants who came to the country were farm laborers, and that the United States Government ought to establish an Immigrant Land Loan Fund, which would advance small sums to immigrants who settled on Western lands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/04/104894635.pdf "Would Send Aliens to Western Farms," ''New York Times,'' April 4, 1912] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Barstow was born on November 19, 1849, in Providence, the son of Amos Chafee, a manufacturer, banker and one of the most prominent men in the city, and Emeline (Mumford) Eames. Young George was educated at a public school and at [[Mowry and Goff's Classical School]] in that city. He was married to Clara Drew Symonds on October 19, 1871. They had nine children — Caroline Hartwell, George Eames Jr., Herbert Symonds, Helen Louise, Harold Carleton, Marguerite, Putnam, Donald and  a ninth child,  John P. or Paris (the sources differ). Barstow, who attended a Congregational church in Providence and a Methodist church in Texas, died on April 30, 1924, in Barstow and was buried in the Barstow Cemetery.&lt;ref name=TexasObit&gt;[http://www.txgenweb2.org/txward/george_eames_barstow.htm Claudia Hazelwood, TXGenWeb2.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogytrails.com/ri/providence/bios_B.html ''Rhode Island Men in Progress,'' quoted in "Providence County Biographies," GenealogyTrails.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilario Perez Davide III''' (born August 25, 1964) is a Filipino politician and lawyer who is the current Governor of [[Cebu]]. He is the son of former Chief Justice, [[Hilario Davide Jr.]]

==Early life==
Born in Cebu City on August 25, 1964 to former Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]] and Virginia J. Perez-Davide, both public servants.

==Personal life==
Hilario "Junjun" Davide III is married to Jobella G. Angan and has three daughters: Patricia Janelli, Dana Giannina, and Niña Francesca.

==Educational background==
Junjun finished elementary at the Sacred Heart School for Boys in 1977 and completed high school at the University of the Philippines in the Visayas - Cebu campus in 1981. He then took up Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at University of the Philippines - Diliman, Quezon City where he graduated in 1991. In 1995, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of San Carlos.

==Political life==

===Councilor of Cebu===
Cebu governor Gwendolyn Garcia, unlike 2006 election, now has reason to tighten her belt with the entry of Cebu City councilor Hilario Davide III in the scene.  Councilor Davide is not a big threat to Gov. Gwen Garcia but he is a very good political material for Cebu province. While the governor must tighten her belt, councilor Davide must prepare because he must be sweating too much to beat Garcia.

Perhaps Councilor Hilario Davide III must consume a ton of Sinanduloy and do Suroy-suroy sa Sugbo as fast as he could to win in Cebu gubernatorial race.

The talk about councilor Davide started when presidential aspirant Noynoy Aquino appointed as chairman of the Liberal Party (LP) in Cebu province. The party has yet to reveal its bet for Cebu governor in 2010. When asked about running for Cebu governor, councilor Davide told reporters that he is ready to run.

But he has yet to work on his qualifications. Hilario Davide III is currently serving as Cebu City councilor. Cebu City residents do not vote for Cebu provincial governor. Davide’s residence issue is being solved. According to reports, he will transfer his voter’s record to Argao. When he does, he needs also to resign as Cebu City councilor.

Transferring his voter’s record on or before October 30 will still not solve the residence issue.

According to Republic Act No. 7160, the Local Government Code of 1991, Section 39:

SEC. 39. Qualifications. – (a) An elective local official must be a citizen of the Philippines; a registered voter in the barangay, municipality, city, or province or, in the case of a member of the sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlungsod, or sanggunian bayan, the district where he intends to be elected; a resident therein for at least one (1) year immediately preceding the day of the election; and able to read and write Filipino or any other local language or dialect.

Two major newspaper in Cebu report today about councilor Davide’s plan to quit Cebu  City councilor. In Sun Star Cebu’s report, Davide will step down from the City Council effective Oct. 30. Cebu Daily News reports that Davide would deliver his farewell speech to the City Council.

Will Davide get the support of most of Cebu towns? This is something we will wait for.

However, The Freeman Cebu reports that Cebu City Councilor Hilario ‘Jun-jun’ Davide III is not the Liberal Party candidate for Cebu governor, quoting LP campaign manager, Batanes Rep. Butch Abad.

Perhaps LP leaders foresee not only tight fight during elections but also tough legal battles before the election.

While councilor Davide enjoyed imagining the bright prospects of holding office in Cebu Cebu provincial capitol, Gov. Gwen Garcia is already there, smiling and silent about her upcoming challenger.

Hilario Davide III as next Cebu governor? This is still a big question.

===2013 elections===
Leading their opponents by more than 160,000 votes, lawyer Hilario Davide III and Acting Governor Agnes Magpale were proclaimed governor and vice governor on Friday, as the provincial canvass wrapped up.

The final and official count showed Davide with 654,054 votes, while Representative Pablo John Garcia got 490,148.

Davide led by 163,906, three years after he lost his first gubernatorial campaign to the then reelectionist Governor Gwendolyn Garcia by more than 96,000 votes.

Magpale got 548,455 votes, while her closest rival, independent candidate Glenn Soco, got 381,120 votes, for a lead of 167,335. One Cebu Party vice gubernatorial candidate Ramon “Boboy” Durano IV got 180,939 votes.

Also proclaimed on Friday were five other district representatives and the remaining members of the Provincial Board (PB).

When Davide and Magpale’s first term begins on July 1, they will have the advantage of a majority in the PB, where eight of 12 newly elected members were also allies of the Liberal Party (LP).

The Provincial Board of Canvassers, chaired by Provincial Election Supervisor Eddie Aba, also proclaimed on Friday Representatives [[Luigi Quisumbing]] (sixth district); [[Joseph Ace Durano|Joseph Felix “Ace” Durano]], who sent a representative (fifth district); Benhur Salimbangon (fourth district); Wilfredo Caminero (second district); and Anthony “Samsam” Gullas (first district).

Congresswoman-elect [[Gwendolyn Garcia]] was proclaimed last Thursday afternoon. Apart from the suspended governor, her brother Nelson was also earlier proclaimed mayor of Dumanjug.

'''Johann Culemeyer''' (16 October 1883 - 20 January 1951) was a German [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Lexicon der Eisenbahn |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culemeyer was born in Hanover in 1883 and, in 1936, he became a director of the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] and in that capacity was responsible for the construction, procurement and running of road vehicles, railway wagons and heavy transporters.

As early as 1931, he had designed a transportation system which was subsequently named after him, the "Culemeyer heavy [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berth.eu/waggon_de.html as at 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This heavy road trailer enabled the transportation of [[goods wagons]] on the road. These trailers initially had four axles with 16 solid rubber wheels. From 1935, a six-axle, 24-wheel version was also produced.

Under the [[slogan]] ''Die Eisenbahn ins Haus'' ('The Railway to Your Door')  goods wagons were brought to factories and other places that did not have their own railway links from the nearest loading station. It was patented on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1931 under the name ''Fahrbares Anschlussgleis'' ('Rail Link on Wheels') and demonstrated to the public for the first time on 24&amp;nbsp;April 1931 at the [[Anhalter Bahnhof]] in [[Berlin]].

In the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] the trailers were hauled by ''Kaelble'' tractors; the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)]] in [[East Germany]] used ''[[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]'' tractors.

Whilst ''Culemeyer'' heavy trailers have been largely superseded on the roads by lorries, in some factories and firms they are still used occasionally.

On 4&amp;nbsp;November 1976 a private road belonging to the management of the former Reichsbahn authority (''[[VdeR]]'') in [[Berlin-Marienfelde]] ([[Tempelhof]]) was named after Johann Culemeyer. The road is open to public traffic and is a cul-de-sac with several industrial sites along it, including the ''Berliner Werk der Converteam Deutschland'' that in 1984 moved there as the [[AEG|AEG-Stromrichterfabrik]]. In the vicinity, there is also the ''Schwechtenstrasse'', named after the architect of the Anhalter Bahnhof.

Culemeyer died in 1951 in [[Nordholz]], [[Cuxhaven]], in north Germany.

'''John Bartholomew Sr.''' (26 April 1805 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1861) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[engraver]].

== Life ==
The son of George Bartholomew, engraver (1784–1871), he founded the engraving and mapmaking firm of [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.]] in 1826. Bartholomew also worked for [[George Philip &amp; Son]].

He was a master copper plate engraver and engraved some fine maps for local Edinburgh firms, such as street maps for [[William Home Lizars|Lizars]], others for the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and for some educational publishers like [[A &amp; C Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bartholomew 150 Years|author=Leslie Gardiner|publisher=John Bartholomew &amp; Son Ltd|isbn=0-85152-791-4|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to engrave the map of [[Treasure Island]] for [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].

John Sr. was the ideal person to inaugurate what became one of the most admired cartographic institutions in the world. A man of high standards, as were his successors; he was an accomplished engraver, engraving becoming the foundation of the firm; [[lithography]] would follow later. He also had the vision to recognise the potential for the firm. He was a shy man, holding back from public life.

In 1832–1833 James was living at 4 East St James Street, since demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83399739|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, shortly before he died, John Senior passed the business on to his son [[John Bartholomew]] Junior (1831–1893).

He is buried with his wife, Margaret McGregor in the north-west section of [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]]. His son and his wife are buried with him.

'''''Nathan for You''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Reality television|docu-reality]] [[comedy]] [[television series]] starring comedian [[Nathan Fielder]]. The series was co-created by Fielder and premiered on February 28, 2013 on the American [[cable television]] network [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Comedy Central Sets Mid-Season Schedule Featuring New Series And Specials And The Return Of Network Favorites|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2012/121112-2013-midseason-press-release.jhtml|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=December 11, 2012|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, Fielder plays an off-kilter version of himself, who tries to use his business background and life experiences to help struggling companies and people, frequently offering them outlandish strategies, parodying the methods of marketing and [[Management consulting|management consultants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In "The Movement," Nathan Fielder continues his journey down the left-hand path|website=AV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/movement-nathan-fielder-continues-his-journey-down-227711}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2018, Comedy Central confirmed that ''Nathan For You'' would not continue for a fifth season, with Fielder deciding to focus on other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/nathan-for-you-coming-to-an-end/|title=“Nathan for You” Has Ended, Comedy Central Confirms {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The series centers on Nathan Fielder, portrayed by his real-life namesake, a business school graduate and consultant whose aim is to help struggling businesses. His marketing proposals are often outlandish and elaborate.&lt;ref name="tg15"/&gt; One of the show's long-running story arcs concerns Fielder and his social awkwardness. Throughout episodes, his confidence is eroded as his ideas fail.&lt;ref name="tg15"/&gt; In the show's first season, Fielder is unaware people do not enjoy his company.&lt;ref name="gq15"/&gt; The character is based in Fielder's real life, and his own struggles with [[social anxiety]]; he has noted that he did not want the character to "feel like a comedy character" but one that delivers the "most authentic moments from myself."&lt;ref name="lat15"/&gt;

==Production==
''Nathan for You'' was created by comedian Nathan Fielder and writer Michael Koman. The show evolved out of segments on the Canadian news satire series ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' titled "Nathan On Your Side," wherein Fielder played a consumer advocate. The show was greenlit following the cancellation of ''[[Jon Benjamin Has a Van]]'', which Fielder also wrote and starred in.&lt;ref name="rs13"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nathan For You': Inside Comedy Central's Absurdist Prank Factory|date=April 11, 2013|author=Aaron Frank|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=October 29, 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/nathan-for-you-inside-comedy-centrals-absurdist-prank-factory-20130411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the series' inspiration came from Fielder's fascination with the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and how he found that it was rooted in "these personal moments between people where someone senses something's wrong, but they don't want to speak up."&lt;ref name="lat15"/&gt;

Marketing ideas are developed in myriad ways; often, Fielder and the writing team will come up with an idea specifically for the business, while other times concepts are formed in a completely unrelated way. Ideas can be thrown out if they are deemed not visually interesting or engaging for viewers. As a result, the show's writing process involves "a lot of guessing and testing," according to Fielder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Episodes are constantly re-written based on the interactions they receive.&lt;ref name="gq15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Get Ready for the Weirdest—and Most Personal—Season of Nathan For You Yet|date=October 14, 2015|author= Alex Wong|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|accessdate=October 29, 2015|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nathan-for-you-season-3-qa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielder called the show's process "a very inefficient way of making TV."&lt;ref name="lat15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nathan Fielder finds the laughs by tapping his most awkward, clueless self|date=October 15, 2015|author= Libby Hill |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2015|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-nathan-fielder-nathan-for-you-20151015-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicity ==
Several stunts performed for the series have garnered attention from the [[mainstream media]]. One in particular occurred even before the series premiered.

===Petting Zoo Hero===
{{anchor|Viral pig video}}In the second episode of [[List of Nathan for You episodes#Season 1 (2013)|season one]], Fielder and the show's crew attempted to boost the popularity of a California [[petting zoo]] by turning one of their pigs into a celebrity through the filming of a hoax video of the pig (actually a trained stand-in pig following a plastic course placed beneath the surface) rescuing a goat who was stuck in a pond. Fielder had the crew sign [[non-disclosure agreements]] in order to maintain secrecy around the production.

Fielder uploaded the video to [[YouTube]] in September 2012 under the username "jebdogrpm". He titled the clip "Pig rescues baby goat", and gave it the simple description: "Pig saves goat who’s foot was stuck underwater at petting zoo. Simply amazing."&lt;ref name="piggoat"&gt;[[YouTube]] video: "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WjrvG1GMk Pig rescues baby goat]."&lt;/ref&gt; Fielder made no efforts to promote the piece, but found that websites like [[Gawker]] and [[Reddit]] quickly began reposting the video.&lt;ref name="fake"&gt;{{cite news |title=Really Cute, but Totally Faked |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/arts/television/pig-rescues-goat-and-the-video-is-really-cute-but-totally-faked.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 26, 2013 |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was then picked up on various national news broadcasts, including the ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', ''[[The Today Show]]'', and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="fake" /&gt;

The hoax was finally revealed in February 2013, before the series premiered, by which time the video had received seven million views.&lt;ref name="fake" /&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fielder marveled at how major press outlets had shared the video: "If we were trying to pull an elaborate hoax on the news, I think we could have pushed further.

===Dumb Starbucks===
{{Main article|Dumb Starbucks}}
Over the weekend of February 7, 2014, a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] known as "[[Dumb Starbucks]]" opened in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]]. The shop heavily resembled those of the chain [[Starbucks]] and used a modified version of its logo. The names of all of its products were prefixed with "Dumb," and the shop offered CDs mimicking the real Starbucks products for sale, including "Dumb [[Jazz standard|Jazz Standards]]" and "Dumb [[Norah Jones|Nora Jones]]{{sic}} Duets." The shop argued that it was actually an [[art gallery]] for "legal reasons," because "by adding the word 'dumb' we are technically 'making fun' of Starbucks, which allows us to use their trademarks under a law known as '[[fair use]].'"{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} After attracting a large lineup of curious attendees over the weekend, it was speculated{{By whom|date=September 2017}} that the store was a hoax connected to a television program; on the following Monday, a press conference held at Dumb Starbucks revealed that the store was a ''Nathan for You'' stunt.&lt;ref name=lat-dumbstarbucks&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb Starbucks: Comedy Central star Nathan Fielder behind faux cafe|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-who-is-behind-dumb-starbucks-20140210,0,78772.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-dumbstarbucks&gt;{{cite news|title=Dumb Starbucks: Is LA 'parody' coffee shop performance art, TV stunt or a legal dispute waiting to happen?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/dumb-starbucks-is-la-parody-coffee-shop-performance-art-tv-stunt-or-just-a-legal-dispute-waiting-to-happen-9118464.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the stunt was revealed, some attendees thought that the shop had been created by [[Banksy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teti|first1=John|title=Nathan For You: "Dumb Starbucks"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/nathan-you-dumb-starbucks-207531|website=The A.V.

===The Movement===
Episode three of the show's [[List of Nathan for You episodes#Season 3 (2015)|third season]] focused on Nathan's attempt to help a struggling [[moving company]] by providing the business with free labor. The plan involved the creation and marketing of an original fitness routine called "The Movement," which would emphasize the lifting of household objects (namely boxes and furniture) for exercise, and preclude the need for practitioners to go to a gym or [[health club]]. Nathan would then lure interested parties into working for the moving company by leading them to believe they were simply exercising. Marketing for "The Movement" involved a [[Ghostwriter|ghost-written]] book, which subsequently made it on to the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] best-seller list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/book-weeks-episode-nathan-you-amazon-best-seller-227746|title=''The book from an episode of Nathan For You is an Amazon best seller''|author=Hughes, William|date=30 October 2015|publisher=[[The A.V.

==Other influence==
An appearance in the eighth episode of the show's first season by private investigator Brian Wolfe led to Wolfe getting his own reality series on [[Investigation Discovery]], ''Cry Wolfe''. This was referenced on ''Nathan for You'' on the eighth episode of the second season, when Nathan tried to get a similar reality TV deal for a security guard who had also appeared in season one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nathan For You: "Toy Company/Movie Theatre" |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/nathan-you-toy-companymovie-theatre-208354 |first=John |last=Teti |publisher=A.

==Reception==
''Nathan for You'' has received critical acclaim. [[Neil Genzlinger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed it "the television series with the most incisive take on the 21st-century economy," praising Fielder for "illuminating the relationship between the economy and absurdity."&lt;ref name="nyt15"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Nathan for You,’ on Comedy Central, Mixes Absurdity and Economics|date=October 13, 2015|author=[[Neil Genzlinger]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/arts/television/nathan-for-you-on-comedy-central-mixes-absurdity-and-economics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Thorp of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called its central concept "genius," finding it "functions as a razor-sharp satire of commercialism, with a surprising undercurrent of genuine pathos."&lt;ref name="tg15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nathan For You: finding the comedy in awkward commercialism|date=October 15, 2015|author= John Thorp |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 29, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/oct/15/nathan-for-you-finding-the-comedy-in-awkward-commercialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willa Paskin of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' found it "brilliant, fascinating, and uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="s15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Insanity Defense

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15265">A '''non-executive director''' (abbreviated to '''non-exec''', '''NED''' or '''NXD'''), '''independent director''' or '''external director''' is a member of the [[board of directors]] of a [[company]] or [[organisation]], but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from [[executive director]]s, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as [[corporate officer]]s). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.iod.com/MainWebSite/Resources/Document/roleofnxds_1006.pdf|title = The role of the non-executive director|date = 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = Institute of Directors|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404182211/http://www.iod.com/MainWebSite/Resources/Document/roleofnxds_1006.pdf|archivedate = 4 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Business Journalism: How to Report on Business and Economics|last = Hayes|first = Keith|publisher = Apress|year = 2014|isbn = 1-4302-6349-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coachdirectors.co.uk/executive-coaching/|title=Executive Coaching|work=CoachDirectors|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Professional Issues in Information Technology - Second edition|last = Bott|first = Frank|publisher = BCS Learning &amp; Development Limited|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-78017-180-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Role==
Fundamentally, the non-executive director role is to provide a creative contribution and improvement to the board by providing dispassionate and objective criticism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their role may change depending on the organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bupa.com/corporate/about-us/corporate-governance/role-of-the-non-executive-director|title = Role of the Non-Executive Director|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = BUPA|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Get Started in Shares|last = Arnold|first = Glen|publisher = FT Publishing International|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-273-77122-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are usually not involved in the day-to-day management of the company but monitor the executive activity and contribute to the development strategy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mondaq.com/x/96906/Directors+Officers/The+Increasing+Importance+Of+NonExecutive+Directors|title = The Increasing Importance Of Non-Executive Directors|date = 29 March 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = mondaq|publisher = |last = Wilson|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-executive directors can also be referred to as external directors; they are usually people of stature and experience who can act as both a source of wise independent advice and a check on any wilder elements on a board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 30 Day MBA, 3rd Edition|last = Colin|first = Barrow|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-7494-6990-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UK [[Institute of Directors]], non-executive directors are expected to focus on board matters and not stray into ‘executive direction,’ thus providing an independent view of the company that is removed from day-to-day running.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Non-executive directors, then, are appointed to bring to the board: 
* Independence;
* Impartiality;
* Wide experience;
* Special knowledge;
* Personal qualities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to the above five key qualities an effective non-executive director would influence the achievement of balance of the board of directors as a whole as well as commitment, perception and a broad perspective of the area or industry. More key responsibilities may include:
* Contributing to the strategic direction of the company;
* Efficiently solving problems that arise;
* Communicating with third parties;
* Ensuring all the audit requirements are satisfied;
* Remuneration of the executive directors;
* Appointing the board of directors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.comsuregroup.com/the-increasing-importance-of-non-executive-directors/|title = The Increasing Importance Of Non-Executive Directors|date = 28 February 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = Comsure Group|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key responsibilities==
Non-executive directors have responsibilities in the following areas, according to the [[Review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors]] (the Higgs report), published by the [[British government]] in 2003:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Strategy:''' Non-executive directors should constructively challenge and contribute to the development of strategy. As an external member of an organisation, the NED may have a clearer or wider view of possible factors affecting the company and its business environment, more-so than executive directors.
* '''Performance:''' Non-executive directors should scrutinise the performance of management in meeting-agreed goals and objectives and monitoring and, where necessary, removing senior management, and in [[succession planning]].
* '''Risk:''' Non-executive directors should satisfy themselves that financial information is accurate and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible.
* '''People:''' Non-executive directors can benefit the company's and board's effectiveness through outside contacts and opinions. Helping the business and board connect with networks of useful people and organisations become an important function for the NED to fulfill.

NEDs should also provide independent views on:
* Resources
* Appointments
* Standards of conduct

Boards (and the non-executive directors on them) also have a responsibility to evaluate their own performance. Reasons for undertaking a board evaluation might include: 

* to address specific issues;
* to benchmark performance against other companies;
* the need to ensure that the board is doing the best it can; and
* the need to be seen to be doing something.

Much has been written about how best to go about evaluating board performance and it remains a key topic of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-boards-should-evaluate-their-own-performance|title=How Boards Should Evaluate Their Own Performance|date=2017-03-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1998/01/appraising-boardroom-performance|title=Appraising Boardroom Performance|date=1998-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nurole.com/news_and_guides/how-to-evaluate-board-performance|title=How do you evaluate board performance?|date=2018-04-18|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icaew.com/technical/corporate-governance/uk-corporate-governance/board-evaluations-and-effectiveness-reviews|title=Board evaluations and effectiveness reviews|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative and positive contributions==
Having a non-executive director in a business may seem necessary due to the benefits having one can provide, however it is possible a NED may contribute to a dynamic of deteriorating board relationships. Executives could come to resent or be frustrated by non-executive contributions that they perceive to be either ill-informed or inappropriate. This in turn can contribute to a dynamic of deteriorating board relationships, characterized by withholding of information and mistrust.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00444.x/full|title = Beyond Agency Conceptions of the Work of the Non-Executive Director: Creating Accountability in the Boardroom|last = Roberts|first = John|date = 8 March 2005|journal = British Journal of Management|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00444.x|pmid = |access-date = 3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one executive described it:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘When a non-executive director displays insight and real knowledge and undertakes a role in a very serious fashion, asks brave questions, takes an interest in issues the directors know that they are going to be kept on their toes in relation to these issues, and the respect level rises. Then that person becomes an approachable person … it is actually cumulative in terms of the benefits that can come from that … it can go completely the other way because it is just, “well, they don't know anything about the business, they had to ask the obligatory three questions” and then the respect gets lost between the parties and you do not have a relationship that is built. It gets back down to what is the ability of the person and what is driving them to become engaged … When that engagement actually adds value and can be seen to add value, then very quickly you get a dynamic where you improve the situation.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Audit==
It is the duty of the whole board to ensure that the company accounts properly to its shareholders by presenting a true and fair reflection of its actions and financial performance and that the necessary internal control systems are put into place and monitored regularly and rigorously. A non-executive director has an important part to play in fulfilling this responsibility whether or not a formal audit committee (composed of non-executive directors) of the board has been constituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Director's Handbook|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 2010|isbn = 9780749460587|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
It is vitally important that all Non-executive directors are aware of their duties and liabilities as well as developing the softer skills associated with the role such as board behaviour and effective challenge. There are a number of organisations who provide this type of training such as the Institute of Directors and The Financial Times, who offer a fully accredited Level 7 Diploma for those who wish to embark on a successful portfolio career.

==Types of organisation==
A non-executive director can be appointed in different organisations:
* The Private Sector
* The Public Sector
* Academic Sector
* Third Sector
Duties will depend on whether they represent the interest of shareholders, in the private sector, or the interest of the society in public organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thenonexecrole.nedonboard.com/ |title = What to Expect of the NED Role, NEDonBoard |date = 6 June 2017|accessdate = 3 June 2017 |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appraisal objectives==
Some organisations appraise non-executive directors on general overall performance criteria such as in the Higgs Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbs.com/content/dam/rbs/Documents/about/boards-committees/Terms-and-Conditions-non-executive-directors.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085006/http://www.rbs.com/content/dam/rbs/Documents/about/boards-committees/Terms-and-Conditions-non-executive-directors.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colchesterhospital.nhs.uk/meetings_minutes/supporting_docs/january_2014/16jan14COG%20Agenda%20item%2016%20-%20Chair%20and%20NED%20Appraisals.pdf |format=PDF |title=Council of Governor Meeting: 16 January 2014 |website=Colchesterhospital.nhs.uk |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iod.com/Guidance/briefings/bis-board-and-director-appraisal|title=Resources and factsheets|website=Iod.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others in addition set specific individual objectives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.neas.nhs.uk/media/60190/item_9_-_perf_apr_of_neds__obj_13.pdf|title = PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT &amp; APPRAISAL OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 2012/13 AND OBJECTIVES FOR 2013/14|date = 12 April 2013|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = neas|publisher = |last = Winter|first = A J G}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be specifically linked to the overall organisation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabp.nhs.uk/members/about/13%20Process%20for%20NED.pdf |format=PDF |title=Council of Governor Meeting: 2 March 2009 |website=Sabp.nhs.uk |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">'''Oldřich Klimecký''' (* 16 February 1940) [[Entrepreneurship|Czech entrepreneur]], [[researcher]], [[Management|manager]], and former director of Mostecká uhelná společnost.

== Career ==
After graduating from [[Technical University of Ostrava|VSB-Technical University of Ostrava]] (VSB-TUO), he spent most of his life devoted to [[Brown coal|brown-coal mining]] research in then [[Czechoslovakia]]. At VSB-TUO he also earned the academic title of CSc (a Doctoral-equivalent degree). After the [[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989, he became the director of the Brown Coal Research Institute (Výzkumný ústav pro hnědé uhlí) in Most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-60034470-mostecka-uhelna-svycarsko-soud|title=Kauza Mostecká uhelná, dějství druhé: Soud si předvolal absentéry Koláčka a Klimeckého|first=|last=ČTK|date=9 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade began to address the very poor situation at Mostecká uhelná společnost (MUS) in 1995, it started looking for a new CEO for the mining company. The winner of the selection procedure was Oldřich Klimecký, who was tasked with restructuring MUS as quickly as possible, so that for the future Czech power supply, mining would continue on prospective sites only and end everywhere else.

Upon agreement with the representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the National Property Fund, the regions and major shareholders, all of whom were members of the Board of Directors of MUS, Oldřich Klimecký initiated fundamental changes in the management of the entire company and the company’s transition to a [[market economy]]. In cooperation with the new management of MUS, he created new economic and business rules for MUS and succeeded in stabilising MUS within a few short years and securing its future.

Oldřich Klimecký has long been interest in the development of the entire Most region and has supported the development of the municipalities located there. Under his direction, MUS provided financial support in the tens of millions of crowns. He was also greatly involved in the construction of the Hippodrome, which was built on former mining dumps. The [[Hippodrome]] project in Most, which is part of the Velebudice land rehabilitation park, is one of the most important projects of the Czech land rehabilitation school.&lt;ref name="penize.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rejstrik.penize.cz/oldrich-klimecky|title=Oldřich Klimecký, 7. 2. 2017 - Obchodní rejstřík - Peníze.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldřich Klimecký has also long been engaged in politics in the Most region. He became a member of the Most municipal council in 1994, representing ODS. Oldřich Klimecký still lives in Most, now as a retiree and is no longer involved in either business or politics.&lt;ref name="penize.cz"/&gt;

== MUS case ==
In October 2013, he was sentenced to 37 months in prison by the [[Swiss]] court of first instance in [[Bellinzona]] for fraud and money laundering in connection with Appian’s purchase of a minority package of MUS shares from the Czech government in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/246882-kraus-mus-jsme-nevytunelovali-ale-zachranili/?mobileRedirect=off|title=Kraus: MUS jsme nevytunelovali, ale zachránili|first=Česká|last=televize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his advanced age and poor health, he has not attended any of the court hearings, always using the possibility to be represented by an [[Attorney at law|attorney]]. As all of his assets and even part of his old-age pension have been seized in the Czech Republic due to the criminal proceedings, he has to be represented by an attorney appointed to him ex officio. After 15 years of continuous investigation, Oldřich Klimecký has given up on justice, lives a secluded life, does not comment on the case and does not communicate with the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/oldrich-klimecky-se-nedostavil-ke-svycarskemu-soudu-v-kauze-mus-je-doma-v-moste--1211768|title=Oldřich Klimecký se nedostavil ke švýcarskému soudu v kauze MUS.

[[File:Primo Nebiolo.jpg|thumb|200px|Primo Nebiolo in the 1970s]]
'''Primo Nebiolo''' (14 July 1923, [[Turin]] – 7 November 1999, Rome) was an Italian sports official, best known as president of the worldwide athletics federation [[International Association of Athletics Federations]].

Primo Nebiolo was the ideator of the [[IAAF Continental Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mini/centenary/News/NewsDetail.aspx?id=63195|title=Past Presidents of the IAAF|publisher=iaaf.org|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Primo Nebiolo Stadium eastern.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The external of [[Stadio Primo Nebiolo|Primo Nebiolo Stadium]] in [[Messina]]]]
As an active athlete in his younger days, Nebiolo was a [[long jump]]er. He later studied law and [[political science]] and became a businessman in construction. Nebiolo became president of the [[International University Sports Federation]], which among other things arranges the [[Universiade]], in 1961. From 1969 to 1989 he was the president of the [[Italian Athletics Federation]]. He became a member of the IAAF council in 1972, president of the [[Association of Summer Olympic International Federations]] in 1983 and a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1992. He played a role in winning the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] bid for his home city Turin.

In 1981 Nebiolo became president of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] as a result of [[Horst Dassler]] of [[International Sport and Leisure|ISL]]'s desire to gain more influence within the IAAF and to ensure that ISL retained the IAAF's marketing rights. Unsure of his influence with the IAAF president [[Adriaan Paulen]], Dassler saw Nebiolo as a potentially more friendly ally and so put into action a plan to replace Paulen with Nebiolo. With the next presidential vote scheduled to happen in Moscow in 1980, Dassler used the US boycott as an excuse to have it postponed until the IAAF's next congress in Rome the following year, giving him more time to garner support for Nebiolo. He then advised Paulen that it would be wise for him to declare his candidacy early, as it would discourage candidates other than Nebiolo from announcing they were running and potentially diluting Nebiolo's vote. Dassler's last act was to convince Paulen that Nebiolo had already gained too much support for Paulen to win and that in his own interests, he should bow out. Paulen did so allowing Nebiolo to win the IAAF presidency unopposed.

As president Nebiolo oversaw its restructuring from the International Amateur Athletics Federation, as well as the introduction of regular events such as the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] and allowed athletes to be paid for their participation and endorsement, however his leadership was dogged by accusations of corruption and scandal. For example, it was alleged that in 1995 Nebiolo unsuccessfully offered [[Giorgio de Stefani]], a life member of the [[International Olympic Committee]], 50 million lire to resign his position, thus opening up a position for Nebiolo on the committee. This was followed in 1997 by accusations related to his alleged rigging of the long jump measurement by Italian officials to ensure that Italy's [[Giovanni Evangelisti]] won the bronze medal at the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|1987 World Championships]] in Rome. Although Evangelisti was laterstripped of his medal and disciplinary measures were taken against track officials, Nebiolo, managed to retain his position as president.

Nebiolo was also accused of having a lax attitude toward doping. While he oversaw the establishment of IAAF urine testing laboratories and spoke of the need to eject athletes who doped out of athletics, many questioned how high a priority anti-doping measures really were for him.

His term as president ended when he died from a heart attack in 1999. He was succeeded by vice president [[Lamine Diack]] as acting president; Diack was later elected president. IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] described Nebiolo as "one of the greatest leading sportsmen of this century". However, in contrast Italy's 1960 200 metres Olympic champion [[Livio Berruti]],  described Nebiolo as a person "who trampled over and polluted the sporting ideals that I believed in and which young people today believe in as well. Unfortunately, it is death that has removed Nebiolo from sport and not a movement from within the sporting world itself to defend certain basic rules such as respect, justice, impartiality and love. These are values which were amply forgotten by Primo Nebiolo."

The [[Stadio Primo Nebiolo]] was named in his honour. A street in [[Bucharest]], the capital of Romania, is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37008">'''Production''' is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). It is the act of creating [[output (economics)|output]], a [[goods and  services|good or service]] which has [[value (economics)|value]] and contributes to the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Kotler", P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) ''Marketing'', 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic well-being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and [[need]]s. The degree to which the needs are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic well-being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic well-being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production.

The most important forms of production are:
* [[Market (economics)|market production]]
* [[Public economics|public production]]
* [[household production]]

In order to understand the origin of the economic well-being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have value and contribute to well-being of individuals.

The satisfaction of needs originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to compensated with the growth of sales volume.

Economic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic well-being and therefore here under review.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==As a source of economic well-being==
In principle there are two main activities in an economy, production and consumption. Similarly there are two kinds of actors, producers and consumers. Well-being is made possible by efficient production and by the interaction between producers and consumers. In the interaction, consumers can be identified in two roles both of which generate well-being. Consumers can be both customers of the producers and suppliers to the producers. The customers’ well-being arises from the commodities they are buying and the suppliers’ well-being is related to the income they receive as compensation for the production inputs they have delivered to the producers.

===Stakeholders of production===

Stakeholders of production are persons, groups or organizations with an interest in a producing company. Economic well-being originates in efficient production and it is distributed through the interaction between the company’s stakeholders. The stakeholders of companies are economic actors which have an economic interest in a company. Based on the similarities of their interests, stakeholders can be classified into three groups in order to differentiate their interests and mutual relations. The three groups are as follows:
[[File:Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders.png|400 px|thumb|right|Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders (Saari, 2011,4)]]

*Customers
*Suppliers
*Producers.
The interests of these stakeholders and their relations to companies are described briefly below. Our purpose is to establish a framework for further analysis. 
 
''Customers''

The customers of a company are typically consumers, other market producers or producers in the public sector. Each of them has their individual production functions. Due to competition, the price-quality-ratios of commodities tend to improve and this brings the benefits of better productivity to customers. Customers get more for less. In households and the public sector this means that more need satisfaction is achieved at less cost. For this reason the productivity of customers can increase over time even though their incomes remain unchanged.

''Suppliers''

The suppliers of companies are typically producers of materials, energy, capital, and services. They all have their individual production functions. The changes in prices or qualities of supplied commodities have an effect on both actors’ (company and suppliers) production functions. We come to the conclusion that the production functions of the company and its suppliers are in a state of continuous change.

''Producer community''

The incomes are generated for those participating in production, i.e., the labour force, society and owners. These stakeholders are referred to here as producer communities or, in shorter form, as producers. The producer communities have a common interest in maximizing their incomes. These parties that contribute to production receive increased incomes from the growing and developing production.

The well-being gained through commodities stems from the price-quality relations of the commodities. Due to competition and development in the market, the price-quality relations of commodities tend to improve over time. Typically the quality of a commodity goes up and the price goes down over time. This development favourably affects the production functions of customers. Customers get more for less. Consumer customers get more satisfaction at less cost. This type of well-being generation can only partially be calculated from the production data. The situation is presented in this study.
The producer community (labour force, society, and owners) earns income as compensation for the inputs they have delivered to the production. When the production grows and becomes more efficient, the income tends to increase. In production this brings about an increased ability to pay salaries, taxes and profits. The growth of production and improved productivity generate additional income for the producing community. Similarly the high income level achieved in the community is a result of the high volume of production and its good performance. This type of well-being generation – as mentioned earlier - can be reliably calculated from the production data.

===Main processes of a producing company===
A producing company can be divided into sub-processes in different ways; yet, the following five are identified as main processes, each with a logic, objectives, theory and key figures of its own. It is important to examine each of them individually, yet, as a part of the whole, in order to be able to measure and understand them. The main processes of a company are as follows:
[[File:Main processes of a company.png|400px|thumb|Main processes of a producing company (Saari 2006,3)]]
* real process.
* income distribution process
* production process.
* monetary process.
* market value process.
Production output is created in the real process, gains of production are distributed in the income distribution process and these two processes constitute the production process. The production process and its sub-processes, the real process and income distribution process occur simultaneously, and only the production process is identifiable and measurable by the traditional [[accounting]] practices. The real process and income distribution process can be identified and measured by extra calculation, and this is why they need to be analyzed separately in order to understand the logic of production and its performance.

Real process generates the production output from input, and it can be described by means of the [[production function]]. It refers to a series of events in production in which production inputs of different quality and quantity are combined into products of different quality and quantity. Products can be physical goods, immaterial services and most often combinations of both. The characteristics created into the product by the producer imply [[surplus value]] to the consumer, and on the basis of the market price this value is shared by the consumer and the producer in the marketplace. This is the mechanism through which surplus value originates to the consumer and the producer likewise. Surplus values to customers cannot be measured from any production data. Instead the surplus value to a producer can be measured. It can be expressed both in terms of nominal and real values. The real surplus value to the producer is an outcome of the real process, real income, and measured proportionally it means productivity.

The concept “real process” in the meaning quantitative structure of production process was introduced in Finnish management accounting in 1960s. Since then it has been a cornerstone in the Finnish management accounting theory. (Riistama et al. 1971)

Income distribution process of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. [[Productivity]] gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product sales prices or to staff as higher income pay.

The production process consists of the real process and the income distribution process. A result and a criterion of success of the owner is profitability. The profitability of production is the share of the real process result the owner has been able to keep to himself in the income distribution process. Factors describing the production process are the components of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], i.e., returns and costs. They differ from the factors of the real process in that the components of profitability are given at nominal prices whereas in the real process the factors are at periodically fixed prices.

Monetary process refers to events related to financing the business. Market value process refers to a series of events in which investors determine the market value of the company in the investment markets.

===Production growth and performance===
{{Main article|Economic growth}}
Economic growth is often defined as a production increase of an output of a production process. It is usually expressed as a growth percentage depicting growth of the real production output. The real output is the real value of products produced in a production process and when we subtract the real input from the real output we get the real income. The real output and the real income are generated by the real process of production from the real inputs.

The real process can be described by means of the production function. The production function is a graphical or mathematical expression showing the relationship between the inputs used in production and the output achieved. Both graphical and mathematical expressions are presented and demonstrated. The production function is a simple description of the mechanism of income generation in production process.  It consists of two components. These components are a change in production input and a change in productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Genesca &amp; Grifell 1992, Saari 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Components of economic growth.png|left|thumb|300px|Components of economic growth (Saari 2006,2)]]

The figure illustrates an income generation process(exaggerated for clarity). The Value T2 (value at time 2) represents the growth in output from Value T1 (value at time 1). Each time of measurement has its own graph of the production function for that time (the straight lines). The output measured at time 2 is greater than the output measured at time one for both of the components of growth: an increase of inputs and an increase of productivity. The portion of growth caused by the increase in inputs is shown on line 1 and does not change the relation between inputs and outputs. The portion of growth caused by an increase in productivity is shown on line 2 with a steeper slope. So increased productivity represents greater output per unit of input.

The growth of production output does not reveal anything about the performance of the production process. The performance of production measures production’s ability to generate income. Because the income from production is generated in the real process, we call it the real income. Similarly, as the production function is an expression of the real process, we could also call it “income generated by the production function”.

The real income generation follows the logic of the production function. Two components can also be distinguished in the income change: the income growth caused by an increase in production input (production volume) and the income growth caused by an increase in productivity. The income growth caused by increased production volume is determined by moving along the production function graph. The income growth corresponding to a shift of the production function is generated by the increase in productivity. The change of real income so signifies a move from the point 1 to the point 2 on the production function (above). When we want to maximize the production performance we have to maximize the income generated by the production function.

The sources of productivity growth and production volume growth are explained as follows. Productivity growth is seen as the key economic indicator of innovation. The successful introduction of new products and new or altered processes, organization structures, systems, and business models generates growth of output that exceeds the growth of inputs. This results in growth in productivity or output per unit of input. Income growth can also take place without innovation through replication of established technologies. With only replication and without innovation, output will increase in proportion to inputs. (Jorgenson et al. 2014,2) This is the case of income growth through production volume growth.

Jorgenson et al. (2014,2) give an empiric example. They show that the great preponderance of economic growth in the US since 1947 involves the replication of existing technologies through investment in equipment, structures, and software and expansion of the labor force. Further they show that innovation accounts for only about twenty percent of US economic growth.

In the case of a single production process (described above) the output is defined as an economic value of products and services produced in the process. When we want to examine an entity of many production processes we have to sum up the value-added created in the single processes. This is done in order to avoid the double accounting of intermediate inputs. Value-added is obtained by subtracting the intermediate inputs from the outputs. The most well-known and used measure of value-added is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It is widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries.

===Absolute (total) and average income===

The production performance can be measured as an average or an absolute income. Expressing performance both in average (avg.) and absolute (abs.) quantities is helpful for understanding the welfare effects of production. For measurement of the average production performance, we use the known productivity ratio

* Real output / Real input.

The absolute income of performance is obtained by subtracting the real input from the real output as follows:
* Real income (abs.) = Real output&amp;nbsp;– Real input

The growth of the real income is the increase of the economic value which can be distributed between the production stakeholders. With the aid of the production model we can perform the average and absolute accounting in one calculation. Maximizing production performance requires using the absolute measure, i.e. the real income and its derivatives as a criterion of production performance.

Maximizing productivity also leads to the phenomenon called "[[jobless recovery|jobless growth]]" This refers to economic growth as a result of productivity growth but without creation of new jobs and new incomes from them. A practical example illustrates the case. When a jobless person obtains a job in market production we may assume it is a low productivity job. As a result, average productivity decreases but the real income per capita increases. Furthermore, the well-being of the society also grows. This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the total productivity change correctly. The combination of volume increase and total productivity decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and total productivity increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are. Therefore, a correct interpretation of a performance change is obtained only by measuring the real income change.

==Production models==
A production model is a numerical description of the production process and is based on the prices and the quantities of inputs and outputs. There are two main approaches to operationalize the concept of production function. We can use mathematical formulae, which are typically used in macroeconomics (in growth accounting) or arithmetical models, which are typically used in microeconomics and management accounting. We do not present the former approach here but refer to the survey “Growth accounting” by Hulten 2009.

We use here arithmetical models because they are like the models of management accounting, illustrative and easily understood and applied in practice. Furthermore, they are integrated to management accounting, which is a practical advantage. A major advantage of the arithmetical model is its capability to depict production function as a part of production process. Consequently, production function can be understood, measured, and examined as a part of production process.

There are different production models according to different interests. Here we use a production income model and a production analysis model in order to demonstrate production function as a phenomenon and a measureable quantity.

===Production income model===
[[File:Profitability of production measured by surplus value.png|left|thumb|400px|Profitability of production measured by surplus value (Saari 2006,3)]]

The scale of success run by a going concern is manifold, and there are no criteria that might be universally applicable to success. Nevertheless, there is one criterion by which we can generalise the rate of success in production. This criterion is the ability to produce surplus value. As a criterion of profitability, surplus value refers to the difference between returns and costs, taking into consideration the costs of equity in addition to the costs included in the profit and loss statement as usual. Surplus value indicates that the output has more value than the sacrifice made for it, in other words, the output value is higher than the value (production costs) of the used inputs. If the surplus value is positive, the owner’s profit expectation has been surpassed.

The table presents a surplus value calculation. We call this set of production data a basic example and we use the data through the article in illustrative production models. The basic example is a simplified profitability calculation used for illustration and modelling. Even as reduced, it comprises all phenomena of a real measuring situation and most importantly the change in the output-input mix between two periods. Hence, the basic example works as an illustrative “scale model” of production without any features of a real measuring situation being lost. In practice, there may be hundreds of products and inputs but the logic of measuring does not differ from that presented in the basic example.

In this context we define the quality requirements for the production data used in productivity accounting. The most important criterion of good measurement is the homogenous quality of the measurement object. If the object is not homogenous, then the measurement result may include changes in both quantity and quality but their respective shares will remain unclear. In productivity accounting this criterion requires that every item of output and input must appear in accounting as being homogenous. In other words, the inputs and the outputs are not allowed to be aggregated in measuring and accounting. If they are aggregated, they are no longer homogenous and hence the measurement results may be biased.

Both the absolute and relative surplus value have been calculated in the example. Absolute value is the difference of the output and input values and the relative value is their relation, respectively. The surplus value calculation in the example is at a nominal price, calculated at the market price of each period.

===Production analysis model===
[[File:Productivity model.png|350px|thumb|[http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%202004%20e.htm Production Model Saari 2004] (Saari 2006,4)]]
A model &lt;ref&gt;Courbois &amp; Temple 1975, Gollop 1979, Kurosawa 1975, Saari 1976, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; used here is a typical production analysis model by help of which it is possible to calculate the outcome of the real process, income distribution process and production process. The starting point is a profitability calculation using surplus value as a criterion of profitability. The surplus value calculation is the only valid measure for understanding the connection between profitability and productivity or understanding the connection between real process and production process. A valid measurement of total productivity necessitates considering all production inputs, and the surplus value calculation is the only calculation to conform to the requirement. If we omit an input in productivity or income accounting, this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any cost impact on accounting results.

===Accounting and interpreting ===
The process of calculating is best understood by applying the term ''ceteris paribus'', i.e. "all other things being the same," stating that at a time only the impact of one changing factor be introduced to the phenomenon being examined. Therefore, the calculation can be presented as a process advancing step by step. First, the impacts of the income distribution process are calculated, and then, the impacts of the real process on the profitability of the production.

The first step of the calculation is to separate the impacts of the real process and the income distribution process, respectively, from the change in profitability (285.12&amp;nbsp;– 266.00 = 19.12). This takes place by simply creating one auxiliary column (4) in which a surplus value calculation is compiled using the quantities of Period 1 and the prices of Period 2. In the resulting profitability calculation, Columns 3 and 4 depict the impact of a change in income distribution process on the profitability and in Columns 4 and 7 the impact of a change in real process on the profitability.

The accounting results are easily interpreted and understood. We see that the real income has increased by 58.12 units from which 41.12 units come from the increase of productivity growth and the rest 17.00 units come from the production volume growth. The total increase of real income (58.12) is distributed to the stakeholders of production, in this case 39.00 units to the customers and to the suppliers of inputs and the rest 19.12 units to the owners.

Here we can make an important conclusion. Income formation of production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income change created in a real process  (i.e. by production function) is always distributed to the stakeholders as economic values within the review period. Accordingly, the changes in real income and income distribution are always equal in terms of economic value.

Based on the accounted changes of productivity and production volume values we can explicitly conclude on which part of the production function the production is. The rules of interpretations are the following:

The production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity and production volume increase or
* productivity and production volume decrease

The production is on the part of “diminishing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity decreases and volume increases or
* productivity increases and volume decreases.

In the basic example the combination of volume growth (+17.00) and productivity growth (+41.12) reports explicitly that the production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function (Saari 2006 a, 138–144).

Another production model ([http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%201989%20e.htm Production Model Saari 1989]) also gives details of the income distribution (Saari 2011,14). Because the accounting techniques of the two models are different, they give differing, although complementary, analytical information. The accounting results are, however, identical. We do not present the model here in detail but we only use its detailed data on income distribution, when the objective functions are formulated in the next section.

==Objective functions==
An efficient way to improve the understanding of production performance is to formulate different objective functions according to the objectives of the different interest groups. Formulating the [[objective function]] necessitates defining the variable to be maximized (or minimized). After that other variables are considered as constraints or free variables. The most familiar objective function is profit maximization which is also included in this case. [[Profit maximization]] is an objective function that stems from the owner’s interest and all other variables are constraints in relation to maximizing of profits in the organization.

[[File:Income formation.png|300px|right|thumb|Summary of objective function formulations (Saari 2011,17)]]

===The procedure for formulating objective functions===
The procedure for formulating different objective functions, in terms of the production model, is introduced next. In the income formation from production the following objective functions can be identified:
* Maximizing the real income
* Maximizing the producer income
* Maximizing the owner income.
These cases are illustrated using the numbers from the basic example. The following symbols are used in the presentation:
The equal sign (=) signifies the starting point of the computation or the result of computing and the plus or minus sign (+ / -) signifies a variable that is to be added or subtracted from the function. A producer means here the producer community, i.e. labour force, society and owners.

Objective function formulations can be expressed in a single calculation which concisely illustrates the logic of the income generation, the income distribution and the variables to be maximized.

The calculation resembles an [[income statement]] starting with the income generation and ending with the income distribution. The income generation and the distribution are always in balance so that their amounts are equal. In this case it is 58.12 units. The income which has been generated in the real process is distributed to the stakeholders during the same period. There are three variables which can be maximized. They are the real income, the producer income and the owner income. Producer income and owner income are practical quantities because they are addable quantities and they can be computed quite easily. Real income is normally not an addable quantity and in many cases it is difficult to calculate.

===The dual approach for the formulation===
Here we have to add that the change of real income can also be computed from the changes in income distribution. We have to identify the unit price changes of outputs and inputs and calculate their profit impacts (i.e. unit price change x quantity). The change of real income is the sum of these profit impacts and the change of owner income. This approach is called the dual approach because the framework is seen in terms of prices instead of quantities (ONS 3, 23).

The dual approach has been recognized in growth accounting for long but its interpretation has remained unclear. The following question has remained unanswered: “Quantity based estimates of the residual are interpreted as a shift in the production function, but what is the interpretation of the price-based growth estimates?” (Hulten 2009, 18). We have demonstrated above that the real income change is achieved by quantitative changes in production and the income distribution change to the stakeholders is its dual. In this case the duality means that the same accounting result is obtained by accounting the change of the total income generation (real income) and by accounting the change of the total income distribution.

'''Property management''' is the operation, control, and oversight of [[real estate]]. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of [[management]] in any [[business]].

Property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and manpower required to manage the [[Property Cycle|life cycle]] of all acquired property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

For example, an owner of a single family may engage the services of a property management company. The company will then advertise the rental property, handle tenant inquiries, screen applicants, select suitable candidates, draw up a lease agreement, conduct a move in inspection,
move the tenant(s) into the property and collect rental income.
The company will then coordinate any maintenance issues,supply the owner(s) with financial statements and any relevant information regarding the property etc.


== Roles ==

There are many facets to this profession, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager.  Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.

== Licensing ==

=== Australia ===
Every state of [[Australia]] has different licensing and compliance requirements. Generally, to be able to provide property management services, a real estate licence is required.
State of Victoria Australia information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theocguide.com.au|title=theOCguide – Owners Corporation Guide – Melbourne, Victoria|website=www.theocguide.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All tenancy applications received are reference checked inclusive of identification, means of income, previous tenancy references and workplace references.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Additionally tenants are checked against the National Tenancy Information Centre of Australia which records details of defaulting tenants.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the Province of Quebec where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.

British Columbia – The licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BC Real Estate Council (RECBC).
The Real Estate Council of British Columbia is a regulatory agency established by the provincial government in 1958. Its mandate is to protect the public interest by enforcing the licensing and licensee conduct requirements of the Real Estate Services Act. The Council is responsible for licensing individuals and brokerages engaged in real estate sales, rental and strata property management. The Council also enforces entry qualifications, investigates complaints against licensees and imposes disciplinary sanctions under the Act.

The Council is responsible for ensuring that the interests of consumers who use the services of real estate licensees are adequately protected against wrongful actions by the licensees. A wrongful action may be deliberate or may be the consequence of inadequate exercise of reasonable judgment by a licensee in carrying out their duties and responsibilities.

The Council is responsible for determining what is appropriate education in real estate matters for individuals seeking to be licensed as real estate practitioners and arranging for licensing courses and examinations as part of the qualification requirement for licensing. Under the authority of the Council, licensing courses are delivered by the UBC Sauder School of Business, Real Estate Division.

Ontario – no licensing is required to operate, however ACMO – the [[Association of Condo Managers of Ontario]] is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO) the [[Real Estate Council of Ontario]], regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its [[Ontario Condominium Act, 1998|condominium act]]. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.

Saskatchewan and Alberta both require property managers to hold a real estate license.

=== India ===
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet, but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.

=== New Zealand ===
Commercial Property Management leasing agents in New Zealand are required to have a real estate agents licence and operate and audited trust bank account.  Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952. 

Residential property management in New Zealand is an unlicensed and unregulated industry.  Property managers in New Zealand do not require any registration, minimum knowledge or skill.  The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/property-managers-review-underway|title=Property managers review underway|website=The Beehive|language=en-nz|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/no-additional-regulation-property-managers|title=No additional regulation for property managers|website=The Beehive|language=en-nz|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to there already being existing laws which could be used to protect consumers. 

New Zealand licensed Real Estate Agents may offer Residential Property Management service with qualified Real Estate Agents as Property Managers, or property manager's working under the Licensed Real estate agency.  Member Agents are supposed to adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reinz.co.nz/Media/Default/pdf/Codes%20of%20Practice/REINZ%20Code%20of%20Practice%20for%20RPM%20-%20changes%202016.pdf|title=REINZ Property Management Code of Practice|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to the REAA outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Critics state the Real Estate Agents Authority complaint committee as having less scope or jurisdiction for adverse judgement against negligent Property Management licences as they would otherwise to those in "real estate agency work",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/property-managers#article-complaints|title=Consumer Article Property Management Complaints|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; unsatisfactory property management conduct cases can receive findings of "no further action" as opposed to "unsatisfactory conduct"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0066/latest/DLM1152058.html|title=Real Estate Agents Act 2008 No 66 (as at 01 September 2017), Public Act 72 Unsatisfactory conduct – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to "conduct unrelated to estate agency work".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://decisions.dotnous.com/reaa/v2/abstract.aspx?case=2269|title=C07283 Abstract {{!}} Complaint Determinations {{!}} Real Estate Agents Authority|website=decisions.dotnous.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Best practice guidelines&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; imply Licensed Real Estate agencies conducting property management business should collect rent through an audited trust account which brings some certainty to the security of the Landlord and Tenants rental Monies though REAA cases implies that this is not always so.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The Tenancy Tribunal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/about/|title=About the Tribunal {{!}} New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its adjudicators/mediators hear and make judgement on disputes (between landlord and tenants) in relation to any breaches of The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and The Unit Titles Act 2010.

The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate.  A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbh.govt.nz/unit-titles-intro-to-uta-2010|title=Building performance|publisher=Department of Building and Housing NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments, and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.

Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.

The [[National Consumer Agency]] (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.

=== Romania ===
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under Financial business law, Any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities.  Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies.  Companies which manage rented residential property are often members of the [[Association of Residential Letting Agents]]. Companies or individual [[landlord]]s who accept [[tenancy deposit]]s for "[[Assured shorthold tenancy|assured shorthold tenancies]]" (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a [[Tenancy Deposit Scheme (England and Wales)|Tenancy Deposit Scheme]].

Companies which manage apartment buildings are often members of the [[Association of Residential Managing Agents]] (ARMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arma.org.uk |title=AMRA |date=19 March 2013 |publisher=Amber Management|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England &amp; Wales. ARMA promotes high standards of leasehold management by providing advice, training and guidance to its member firms of managing agents. ARMA also produces guidance materials for leaseholders and Residents Management Companies. With over 280 firms in membership, ARMA also campaigns for improvements in the legislation governing the leasehold sector.

=== United States ===
Most states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chasse|first1=Terrance|title=New York State Property Management Law|url=http://www.nycpropertypartners.com/new-york-state-property-management-law/|publisher=NYCPP|quote=all New York property management companies must {{sic|posses}} a real estate broker’s license.

A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp|title=Public License Information|publisher=California Bureau of Real Estate|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpropertymanagement.com/propertylaw/|title=Property Management Requirements by State|date=10 September 2012|publisher=All Property Management|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Some states with high tourism numbers, such as Hawaii&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/hawaii/articles/2017-03-23/hawaii-committees-pass-new-versions-of-vacation-rental-bills|title=Hawaii Committees Pass New Versions of Vacation Rental Bills|last=|first=|date=23 March 2017|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, have strict property management rules.

In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the [[California Bureau of Real Estate]] as a [[Real estate broker|Real Estate Broker]].  A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/business/10131.html|title=California Business and Professions Code  Section 10131 – California Attorney Resources – California Laws|website=law.onecle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/02/realestate/re-aptlife2|title=On-Site Managers Aren't Always Required|first=KEVIN|last=POSTEMA|date=2 June 2002|publisher=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation [[Real Estate Broker]] is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as [[Realtor]], [[Real estate broker|Agent]], or [[Salesperson]].

=== Panama ===

In order to be able to manage properties in Panama, at that moment, no licenses are required, as long as the company is focussed on managing properties. Nevertheless, a real estate company which plans to buy and sell properties requieres a license.

=== Kenya ===
In [[Kenya]] the [[Estate Agents Registration Board]] (EARB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estateagentsboard.or.ke |title=Estate Agents Registration Board (EARB) |date=25 October 2018 |publisher=estateagentsboard.or.ke |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the regulatory body for estate agency practice in Kenya and it derives its mandate from Estate Agents Act, 1984 Cap 533&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saccotek.co.ke/docs/Estate%20Agents%20Act%2017%20of%201984%20Cap%20533.pdf |title=Estate Agents Act Cap 533 |last=|first=|date=|publisher=saccotek.co.ke |website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was operationalized in 1987. As per the provisions of the Act, the Board is charged with the responsibility of registering estate agents and ensuring that the competence and conduct of practicing estate agents are of a standard sufficiently high to ensure the protection of the public.
The Board also keeps a list of registered members on its website that is accessible to members of public, In ACCORDANCE with section 9 of the Estate Agents Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estateagentsboard.or.ke/members.html |title=registered members list |date=25 October 2018 |publisher=estateagentsboard.or.ke |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board recently drafted a proposal with a set of amendments to the Estate Agents Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saccotek.co.ke/docs/Proposed%20Amendments%20to%20the%20Estate%20Agents%20Act%20Cap%20533-2017.pdf |title=Proposed Amendments to the Estate Agents Act Cap 533-2017 |last=|publisher=saccotek.co.ke |first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Associations that real estate agents and property developers can join include: [[Kenya Property Developers Association]] (KPDA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kpda.or.ke |title=Kenya Property Developers Association - Development Brings Development |date=25 October 2018 |publisher=kpda.or.ke |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPDA was established in [[Nairobi]] in 2006 as the representative body of the residential, commercial and industrial property development sector in [[Kenya]]. It is an emerging Business Member Organisation which works in proactive partnership with policy-makers, financiers and citizens to ensure that the property development industry grows rapidly but in an organized, efficient, economical and ethical manner. Another Association is the [[Kenya Professional Realtors Association]] (KPRA) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kprakenya.co.ke |title=KPRA - The Voice Of Real Estate Professionals In Kenya |date=25 October 2018 |publisher=Kangai Technologies|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Property management software ==
Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers are able to function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a major cause of the price declines.  In addition to the core property management software options, there is a quickly growing number of closely related software products being introduced to the industry.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Property management system, also known as a PMS, is a comprehensive software application used to cover objectives like coordinating the operational functions of the front office, bookings, communication with guests, planning, reporting etc. This kind of software is used to run large-scale hotels and vacation properties.

== Business models ==

=== Percentage of rent ===
This is the most common model, and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don't usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount, and shares the rest with the property owner.

=== Fixed fee ===
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.

=== Guaranteed rent ===
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company's income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.

=== Revenue share ===
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue.{{cn|date=February 2017}} There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

'''Raoul Warocqué''' ([[Brussels]], 4 February 1870 – [[Brussels]], 28 May 1917), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist from [[Wallonia]].

==Biography==
Raoul was the great-grandson of [[Nicolas Warocqué]], the founder of the prominent Warocqué family. His father was [[Arthur Warocqué]], (1835–80),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907064944/http://www.morlanwelz.be/histoire/vandeneynde/arthur_warocque.htm Arthur Warocqué (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; a promotor of Belgian horticulture, after whom the [[Araceae|arum]] ''[[Anthurium warocqueanum]]'' was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[James Herbert Veitch]]| title=Hortus Veitchii| publisher=[[Caradoc Doy]] | year=2006|edition=reprint|pages=227| isbn=0-9553515-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warocqué was a [[philanthropist]] and a believer in [[paternalism]]. He was a [[freemason]] of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], Belgian [[patriotism|patriot]] and a [[monarchist|royalist]]. At the [[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB), he participated in the ''Jeune Garde libérale'' (Young Liberal Guard). 

[[File:Université de Mons-Hainaut (1).JPG|thumb|Building of the former ''École de Commerce'' in [[Mons]] which Warocqué founded]]
Raoul Warocqué made the coal mines of [[Morlanwelz|Mariemont]] successful, and at 21 years of age had established a considerable fortune. A careful investment policy made him the richest man in Belgium at the beginning of the 20th century. His industrial ventures were numerous, such as in the coal mines of [[Campine]] as well as in other industrial sectors including [[Clabecq]], Gas and Electricity of Hainaut, railroads and coal mines in [[China]], tobacco in [[Portugal]], and others.

As a politician he was mayor of [[Morlanwelz]] and liberal deputy of [[Thuin]]. In [[Mariemont, Belgium|Mariemont]] and in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], he founded liberal organizations. He supported bills favorable to the [[working class]], while at the same time he was opposed to the right to strike. His most noted interventions relate to the [[Belgian Congo]], military service, compulsory education and coal mining.

As a philanthropist, he created open dormitories in Brussels (1891) which distributed soup and bread to the poor. He supported the ULB, the ''Ecole des Mines'' (School of Mining), and founded the ''Institut commercial'' (Commercial Institute) in [[Mons]] as well as the ''Athénée du Centre'' (Central Athenaeum) in [[Morlanwelz]], an orphanage, a childcare facility, a maternity hospital, and some other institutions.

He was also one of the financiers of the [[List of world expositions|World Fair of Brussels]] ([[Brussels International (1897)|1897]] and 1910) and of [[Charleroi]] (1911). He fell ill and died during [[World War I]], in 1917. On his death in 1917, his art and antiquities collections were donated to the Belgian state and now form the basis for the [[Musée royal de Mariemont]].

'''Small Business Majority''' is a [[small business]] [[advocacy]] organization in the [[United States]]. It is based in [[San Francisco]], with offices in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[New York City]], [[Denver]] and [[St. Louis]]. 

Small Business Majority performs opinion polling and writes studies to highlight questions and opinions on issues affecting small businesses. It uses this information to provide small business owners with information on how [[law]]s affect their bottom line, and to educate [[policymaker]]s on a diverse set of issues that they can then advocate for, such as [[healthcare reform]], access to credit and [[Job creation program|job creation]].

== History ==
John Arensmeyer founded Small Business Majority in 2005.

== Healthcare reform ==
Small Business Majority opines on how the [[healthcare system]] affects small businesses, and lobbies to influence the implementation of [[Health care reform in the United States|healthcare reform]]. 

During the push for passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], Small Business Majority lobbied in support for the act. Policy papers and materials the organization developed were used by healthcare reform advocates and small business groups to push the message of small business support for healthcare legislation. Small Business Majority organized small business forums at the [[White House]] with cabinet members and with the [[Senate Small Business Committee|US Senate Small Business Committee]], along with House committees and [[caucus]]es on healthcare issues. The ''[[National Journal]]'' noted that Small Business Majority's work on this issue "gained prominence on [[Capitol Hill]] and at the White House during the health care debate.&lt;ref&gt;Vaida, Bara. "Steering Small Biz Left." ''National Journal''. January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; " Small Business Majority continues to inform [[lawmaker]]s, [[employer]]s and the public on key provisions of the law, and on the various aspects of its implementation, particularly state [[health insurance exchange]]s and the small business healthcare tax credits.

==Clean Energy==
Since Small Business Majority began working on [[clean energy]] issues in 2010, the organization has commissioned a wide body of  opinion research to determine small business owners’ views on clean energy policies and the perceived effect of those policies on their businesses and the [[economy]] as a whole. The organization also conducts in-depth economic research analyzing the economic impact of state and federal clean energy policies on small firms. 

Small Business Majority uses its scientific opinion polling and economic research to lobby for clean energy measures. This has included meetings with national and state policymakers including [[U.S. senators]], representatives and [[Obama administration]] officials.

Small and medium-sized enterprises divided into two groups in Azerbaijan.
* Individual entrepreneurs, so without creating legal person the sole owner of the enterprise. Individual entrepreneurs are persons involved in the business sphere without the formation of any legal entity and possess unlimited liability.
* Small and medium-sized enterprises, that is, legal entities, which individual entrepreneurs legally considered as small businesses. Individuals who registered as a legal person classifies according to two kinds of indicators: the amount of employees and in accordance with its annual turnover.

The number of small entrepreneurs has increased in 2015 about 9 429 people compared to 2014. In addition, 178 163 of them were individual entrepreneurs. Individual entrepreneur mostly agglomerated in the sectors, especially trade, and where take more revenues instead of minimum investments. Only a little amount of entrepreneurs takes part in business activities, which require high early investments and make profit in a long-term. On average, individual entrepreneurs employ less people and by this way, they decrease their expenditures and make more profit.

Legal entities registered by central administrations of ministries and agencies, and inspected carefully by them. Small enterprise is an entrepreneurship that controlled by legal entity and indicated in the disposal of the Ministry Cabinet. In this disposal the main principles for small and medium-sized enterprises are indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cesd.az/new/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CESD_Report-SMEs_Azerbaijan.pdf|title=Small and Medium Entrepreneurship in Azerbaijan; Country Assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Juffali was the chairman of [[E. A. Juffali and Brothers]],&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; a position he has held since at least 2005.&lt;ref name=Albawaba&gt;{{cite news|title=Entrepreneurial Reality Show, "The Investor"|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/mbc-signs-walid-juffali-front-new-entrepreneurial-reality-show-investor-0|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=Albawaba|date=11 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Juffali was also chairman of [[Saudi American Bank]], deputy chairman of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Honorary Consul-General for Denmark.&lt;ref name=Albawaba /&gt;

In December 2005, the [[Middle East Broadcasting Corporation]] (MBC) announced that Juffali would host its entrepreneurial reality show, ''The Investor'', which would be shown early in 2006.&lt;ref name=Albawaba /&gt; In her book ''Arab Television Today'', Naomi Sakr, compared the show to ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', but noted that each of the 13 pairs of would-be entrepreneurs had to be from the same family, to reflect the "family aspect of business in the Arab world".&lt;ref name="Sakr2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi Sakr|title=Arab Television Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhpGsXK5EPYC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=15 December 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-564-7|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juffali also had a separate company, W Investments, a private wealth management company.&lt;ref name=ImperialCollege /&gt; The CEO is [[Jamil El Imad]], who is also managing director and chief scientist of his NeuroPro company.&lt;ref name=neuropro&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Management Team|url=http://www.neuropro.ch/about/management-team/|website=neuropro|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal immunity==
On 9 November 2015, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Juffali had gained [[legal immunity]] in the UK, having been appointed as [[St Lucia]]'s "Permanent Representative" to the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which is headquartered in London.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blair |first1=David |title= Saudi billionaire gains legal immunity in Britain with career as Caribbean diplomat |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11984928/Saudi-billionaire-gains-legal-immunity-in-Britain-with-career-as-Caribbean-diplomat.html |accessdate=11 November 2015 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location= London |date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, St Lucia's Office of the Prime Minister issued a statement, confirming that Juffali was appointed to the role in April 2014, "that all necessary due diligence was done prior to the appointment", and it declined the request from his ex-wife's lawyers to "lift the diplomatic immunity of Dr. Juffali to compel Dr. Juffali to testify in the civil suit ... this is a civil matter in which it does not desire to get involved."&lt;ref name=SaintLucia&gt;{{cite press release |title=Statement on Dr. Walid Juffali |url= http://education.govt.lc/news/statement-on-dr-walid-juffali |accessdate=18 November 2015 |publisher=St Lucia Ministry of Education, Human Resource Development and Labour |date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 December 2015, ''The Daily Telegraph'' reported that it understood that the British Foreign Office had intervened to ask St Lucia to waive Juffali's immunity, amid concerns that he was using it to protect his wealth from his ex-wife during divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_20151226&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alexander |first1=Harriet |title=Britain intervenes to strip Saudi billionaire of diplomatic immunity ahead of divorce case |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/saintlucia/12070077/Britain-intervenes-to-strip-Saudi-billionaire-of-diplomatic-immunity-ahead-of-divorce-case.html |accessdate=2 January 2016 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2016, ''The Daily Telegraph'' reported that the High Court had ordered [[Philip Hammond]], the British Foreign Secretary to certify whether Juffali had been formally accepted by the UK as a diplomat representing St Lucia, as his ex-wife's lawyer stated that Juffali had never attended an IMO meeting.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_20160121_1&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blair |first1=David |title=Philip Hammond ordered to certify if Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali is a Caribbean diplomat |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/saintlucia/12111257/Philip-Hammond-ordered-to-certify-if-Saudi-billionaire-Walid-Juffali-is-a-Caribbean-diplomat.html |accessdate=28 January 2016 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge lifted restrictions on reporting his ex-wife's claim that Juffali was seriously ill with cancer in a Swiss hospital since, if he were to die before the case is concluded, her claim would become irrelevant, and she and their daughter would receive no further monthly payments.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_20160121_2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blair |first1=David |title=Saudi billionaire in London court battle is 'suffering from cancer', says ex-wife |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/saintlucia/12113293/Saudi-billionaire-in-London-court-battle-is-suffering-from-cancer-says-ex-wife.html |accessdate=28 January 2016 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the High Court dismissed Juffali's claim of diplomatic immunity as 'spurious'. Juffali appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeal, and was supported by an intervention from the Foreign Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramesh |first1=Randeep |title=Hammond criticises judge for stripping diplomatic immunity from Saudi billionaire |url= https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/22/hammond-criticises-judge-for-stripping-diplomatic-immunity-from-saudi-billionaire |accessdate=22 March 2016 |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's dismissal of Juffali's immunity, but ruled that his immunity was not relevant to the divorce claim, which it allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramesh |first1=Randeep |title=Ex-wife of Saudi billionaire wins right to claim slice of his fortune |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/ex-wife-saudi-billionaire-sheikh-walid-juffali-right-claim-slice-fortune |accessdate=23 March 2016 |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divorce of Juffali and his second wife, Christina Estrada, was concluded in the British courts in July 2016 with Estrada being awarded £75&amp;nbsp;million, the largest such settlement in English legal history.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/former-pirelli-calendar-model-awarded-75m-in-largest-divorce-set/|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|title=Former Pirelli calendar model awarded £75m in largest divorce settlement in English legal history|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 20 July 2016, Juffali died in Zurich, Switzerland, after a lengthy period with cancer. &lt;ref name="Mail_20160722"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Amie|title=Saudi billionaire dies just two weeks after his supermodel ex-wife was awarded £75m in high court divorce settlement|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3703765/Ex-supermodel-awarded-75million-kind-divorce-settlement-Saudi-billionaire-ex-wait-payout-died.html|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Juffali's first wife was fellow Saudi, Basma Al-Sulaiman, who received £40&amp;nbsp;million in a divorce settlement in 2000.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_20150614 /&gt; They married in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia in 1980, where they lived in a marble palace. Guests of Juffali in Jeddah included [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[John Major]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=Mail_20040123&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kay |first1=Richard |title= The beauty who cost lover Pounds 40m |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-228583/The-beauty-cost-lover-Pounds-40m.html |accessdate=11 November 2015 |work=Daily Mail |location= London |date=23 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children.&lt;ref name=highbeam&gt;{{cite news |title= Mother in dark on Christina's 'baby' |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77754608.html |work=Daily Mail |location= London |author= Dempster, Nigel |date=31 August 2001 |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Juffali married Christina Estrada, an American former [[Pirelli Calendar]] model, but they divorced in 2014.&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; Estrada started divorce proceedings in 2012, after he married Loujain Adada (Saudi law allows up to four wives), and has made a claim against Juffali for at least his three UK properties, which include a seven-bedroom home in [[Knightsbridge]], London, in a converted church, valued in total at about £60&amp;nbsp;million. Juffali and Estrada have a teenage daughter.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_20150614&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ex-model once linked to Prince Andrew 'in divorce battle with husband worth £4bn'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11673981/Ex-model-once-linked-to-Prince-Andrew-in-divorce-battle-with-husband-worth-4bn.html|accessdate=11 November 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juffali also owned [[Bishopsgate House, Egham|Bishopsgate House]] in [[Egham]], Surrey, which he acquired from his parents in about 2001.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/inside-british-homes-saudi-billionaire-walid-juffali-three-butlers/|title=Inside the British homes of Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali... with three butlers, six gardeners, £4m of art|first=Rosa|last=Silverman|date=3 February 2018|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 February 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were "three butlers, six gardeners, five maids, two laundry girls, two drivers, two personal assistants, two nannies and an estate manager on the staff".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"/&gt; Juffali's art collection, estimated at £4 million, will be auctioned onsite at Bishopsgate House by Bonham's on 26 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/25446/|title=Bonhams : THE WALID JUFFALI COLLECTIONOffered by Bonhams Onsite at Bishopsgate House, Surrey|author=|date=|website=www.bonhams.com|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Loop&amp;ndash;LaSalle Street Historic District''' is a historic district centered on [[LaSalle Street]] in the western [[Chicago Loop]]. The district encompasses Chicago's financial center, which is anchored by the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], and also includes several of its major government buildings. Development in the district began in 1873 and, with the exception of a lull during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], has continued through the present day. Most of the district's buildings are [[high-rise building|high-rises]] with at least ten stories, with the tallest being the 49-story [[One North LaSalle Building]]. Many of Chicago's prominent architectural firms designed buildings within the district, and the buildings feature styles such as [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]], [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], [[Art Deco]], [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]], and [[International Style (architecture)|International]]. Significant buildings within the district include the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], [[Chicago City Hall]], and several office buildings for large banks and insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Euer|first1=Danielle|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: West Loop - LaSalle Street Historic District|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/801903.pdf|publisher=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Peter Barber''' (10 September 1857 – 15 January 1943) was a New Zealand [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Newtown (New Zealand electorate)|Newtown]] in [[Wellington]].

==Early life and family==
Born in Wellington in 1857, Barber was educated at St Peter's School.  He began work in his father's dyeing firm of Barber and Company, and eventually became its head. He married Emily Clarke, of Somerset, England in 1879, and had three sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name="EP obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19430115.2.26 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]] |volume=CXXXV|issue=12|date=15 January 1943|page=3|title=Obituary Mr. W.H.P.

William Barber represented the [[Wellington]] electorate of [[Newtown (New Zealand electorate)|Newtown]] for the whole of its existence, from [[New Zealand general election, 1902|1902]] to 1908. In [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908]] he was defeated for the reconstituted electorate of [[Wellington South (New Zealand electorate)|Wellington South]].

===New Liberal Party===
Barber was associated with the [[New Liberal Party (New Zealand)|New Liberal Party]]. His favourite idea was one shared by the other New Liberals-that the institutions of local government should be strengthened and given more scope and power. He heartily supported [[Harry Ell]]'s 1904 Municipal Corporations Bill, which provided for borough councils to hold referenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal = New Zealand Parliamentary Debates  
 |volume = 123 |pages = 372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber also advocated state fire insurance, state coal mines, and the old radical favourite, reduction of taxes on the necessities of life. However, he did not favour the elective executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal = New Zealand Times |date = 24 November 1902|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==

'''William Percy Carpmael''' (May 1864&amp;nbsp;– 27 December 1936) was the founder and first president of the [[rugby union]] [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarian Football Club]]. Carpmael was born the eldest of eight in [[Briscobel]], [[Streatham]] in England.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith13"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Carpmael was educated at [[Christ's College, Finchley]] where he was a boarder, and later at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=CRPL883WP|name=Carpmael, William Percy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On completing university he joined his father's firm of patent agents; Carpmaels and Ransford of Chancery Lane. He would eventually become senior partner of the firm.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith13"/&gt;

While at Cambridge, Carpmael, or 'Tottie' as he was known, was a keen sportsman. He played cricket, rowed for the Lent Boat and was a keen steeplechaser; but it was rugby that he enjoyed playing the most. In 1885 he won his [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] in a varsity match as a forward. Due to Carpmael's close ties with his university the Barbarians, as a club, were also close to Cambridge and Blackheath.

==The Barbarians==
In the early 1880s there were very few touring teams; clubs would travel to matches, but rarely would they undertake a schedule of matches that stretched over days. In December 1884, Jesus College undertook such a 'tour', playing four northern clubs over five days in [[Yorkshire]]. Carpmael was part of the touring team, and believed it to be a very successful venture.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith14"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 Carpmael himself organised a tour with Clapham Rovers, in which the team faced five or six clubs in the Midlands and Yorkshire areas.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith15"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year saw a tour with the Southern Nomads and later the first Barbarian tour. On 8 April 1890 at Leuchter's Restaurant in Darley Street, [[Bradford]]; Carpmael took his Southern Nomads for a meal to put forward his idea of a touring rugby club. Later that night, at the Alexandra Hotel, the 'high-spirited' team agreed to Carpmael's plan and the Barbarians were formed.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith20"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 20.&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was to create a touring team that would play the provinces at holiday times and not only contain Englishmen but players from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and Ireland.

Carpmael took the Barbarians very seriously and it was his dedication over the early years that created the foundations for a club that would last the coming decades. Not only would he organise and promote, but he also administered the club, writing up the club records on manuscript every season.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith16"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the club's first Honorary Secretary and Treasurer, running the club from his father's business at 24 Southampton Buildings in Chancery Lane. In 1902 he resigned his role as secretary, but in 1913 he took up the role of club President.

Carpmael not only ran the Barbarians but also played for the club. He represented the Ba-Baa's on twenty occasions usually as a forward.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith16"/&gt;

==Later life and death==
Carpmael's later years were plagued by ill health, and in 1925 he retired from work, suffering from chronic [[arthritis]]. In 1927 he emigrated to [[Menton]] in the South of France for health reasons. He remained in close touch with his Barbarians, sending a telegram to their headquarters, at the Esplanade in [[Penarth]], every Easter. On 27 December 1936, Carpmael died at his home in France after a long struggle with cancer. He was laid to rest on the hill above Menton and the Barbarian match played against Leicester on 28 December saw both teams wearing black armbands in his honour.&lt;ref name="Starmer-Smith18"&gt;Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2011, during halftime of the Barbarians' match against [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], Carpmael and the Barbarians were inducted to the [[IRB Hall of Fame]] in recognition of their unique contributions to the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2043073.html#carpmael+barbarians+hall+fame |title=Carpmael and Barbarians in Hall of Fame |publisher=[[International Rugby Board]] |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great-nephew George William Thomas Carpmael was a Barbarian mascot for the match.

== Early life  ==
Xavier Lopez Ancona Martinez was born in [[Mexico City]] on April 4, 1964. His father, Isidro Lopez Martinez, worked at a variety of businesses, largely in the food industry and real estate. His mother was a housewife who raised seven children. As child, he wanted to be a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]], and performed in nursing homes and orphanages.

López comes from a large family. He has no children, but he has 16 nephews and enjoys taking them on trips, skiing and diving. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.promotexasmagazine.com/xavier-lopez-ancona-exportando-diversion-al-mundo-con-kidzania/|title=Exportando diversion al mundo con Kidzania|last=|first=|date=|website=promo texas magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==
When his father's real estate company in the San Juan Ixhuatepec area went bankrupt in 1984, López supported his father. As a result he was given the task of selling most of the properties to avoid large losses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/255050|title=Tips Xavier Lopez Ancona|last=|first=|date=|website=entrepreneur.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López studied marketing under [[Philip Kotler]], while working toward his master’s degree. Kotler's classes, leadership and knowledge were key factors when López decided to start and launch the concept of KidZania.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing de ciudades. Edición Mexico: Crear y prosperar en mercados de alto crecimiento.|last=|first=|publisher=LID Editorial|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Ancona founded Kidzania with the goal of making entertainment inclusive, as well as to increase its educational value.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jugaad Innovation: Think Frugal, Be flexible, Generate Breakthrough Growth.|last=|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important lessons López learned during the process of taking KidZania from an entrepreneurial project to a [[multinational company]] was that businesses and cities are highly intertwined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Kidzania ==
Ten million children have visited Kidzania to date.{{When|date=May 2017}}{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Due to the success of the Mexico City park, López plans to open more parks in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
