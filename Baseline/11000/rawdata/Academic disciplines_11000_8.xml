== Background ==
Utilization of halogen containing materials in processes such as water treatment, bleaching, or even general synthesis to create the final product, generates a number of organic halides. These organic halides are released in wastewater from the oil, chemical, and paper industries,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wan Osman|first=Wan Hasnidah|last2=Sheik Abdullah|first2=Siti Rozaimah|last3=Mohamad|first3=Abu Baker|last4=Kadhum|first4=Abdul Amir H.|last5=Abd Rahman|first5=Ramki|orig-year=2013|title=Simultaneous removal of AOX and COD from real recycled paper wastewater using GAC-SBBR|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=121|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.005|year=2013|pages=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find their way to the consumer and eventually to a landfill or oceanic dumps. Within the soil, the halo compounds resist degradation and often react with metal ions, resulting in non-degradable metal complexes, increasing soil toxicity and accumulating in the food chain of aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savant|first=D.V.|last2=Abdul-Rahman|first2=R.|last3=Ranade|first3=D.R.|year=2005|title=Anaerobic degradation of adsorbable organic halides (AOX) from pulp and paper industry wastewater|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=97|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2000 ppm of these bio-accumulative organic chlorides were detected in fat of fish from the waters where bleaching effluents were disposed by paper mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjørseth|first=Alf|last2=Carlberg|first2=George E.|last3=Møller|first3=Mona|date=1979-03-01|title=Determination of halogenated organic compounds and mutagenicity testing of spent bleach liquors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969779900275|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=11|issue=2|pages=197–211|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(79)90027-5|bibcode=1979ScTEn..11..197B}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a 2% water concentration is considered toxic for the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxicity of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent: a Literature Review|last=Hutchins|first=Floyd E|publisher=National Service Center for Environmental Publications|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While strict regulations from the government have reduced the high level of past emissions, these compounds find their way to water sources through improper consumer disposal of items that contain chlorinated compounds. The presence of any organic halides in natural water has been considered an indication of contamination with [[xenobiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grøn|first=Christian|date=1993-08-01|title=Organic Halogen Group Parameters as Indicators of Ground Water Contamination|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x/abstract|journal=Ground Water Monitoring &amp; Remediation|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=148–158|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x|issn=1745-6592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in water, the naturally occurring [[Humic acid|fulvic acids]] and [[humic acid]]s can lead to formation of [[mutagen]]ic compounds such as halogenated furanone MX (Z-3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Långvik|first=Vivi-Ann|last2=Holmbom|first2=Bjarne|date=1994-03-01|title=Formation of mutagenic organic by-products and AOX by chlorination of fractions of humic water|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004313549490006X|journal=Water Research|volume=28|issue=3|pages=553–557|doi=10.1016/0043-1354(94)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of these [[mutagen]]ic compounds could cause several abnormalities in development and reproduction in humans through long half-lives and mimicking hormone receptors. For example, compounds like [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] can inhibit the actions of sex hormones by binding to steroid receptors along with causing long lasting cell disruption in several tissues.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Determination of AOX ==
Persistent organic pollutants such as [[DDT|dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDT), [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenols]], [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], are all assessed in AOX analysis. Generally, the higher the amount of chlorine in an organic compound, the more toxic it is considered.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While there are several biochemical or electrochemical methods to remove organic halides, AOX has been preferred due to its low cost of operation and simplicity of design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a lab, the determination of AOX parameter consists of adsorption of organic halides from the sample on to an [[activated carbon]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The activated carbon can be [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|powdered]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bornhardt|first=C.|last2=Drewes|first2=J. E.|last3=Jekel|first3=M.|date=1997-01-01|title=Removal of organic halogens (AOX) from municipal wastewater by powdered activated carbon (PAC) / activated sludge (AS) treatment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122397002072|journal=Water Science and Technology|series=Advanced wastewater treatment: Nutrient removal and anaerobic processes|volume=35|issue=10|pages=147–153|doi=10.1016/S0273-1223(97)00207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or granular&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and adsorbed using microcolumns&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or a batch process, if the samples are rich in [[humic acid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Vigorous shaking is often employed in the event of a batch process to favor the adsorption of organic halide on to the activated carbon due to its electronegativity and presence of lone pairs. The inorganic halides that are also adsorbed are washed away using a strong acid such as [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The carbon with adsorbed organic halide is obtained by filtration, after which the filter containing the carbon is burnt in the presence of oxygen. While combustion of hydrocarbon part of the compounds form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, halo acids are formed from the halogens. These haloacids are absorbed into acetic acid. Subsequent use of microcolumetric titration, an electrochemical quantification method, provides the AOX content in the sample. Using the dilution ratio, the total AOX content at the location can be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgi.tu-harburg.de/~awwweb/wbt/emwater/lessons/lesson_a1/lm_pg_1055.html|title=ILIAS 3|website=cgi.tu-harburg.de|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the chlorinated compounds in the sample can be determined by using [[pentane]] extraction followed by capillary [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatography]] and [[electron capture]] ([[Gas chromatography|GC-ECD]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The organic carbon that was remaining after the nitric acid purge can be analyzed using UV-persulfate wet oxidation followed by Infrared-detection ([[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several other analytical techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)]] could also be implemented to quantify AOX levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general [[adsorption]] procedure is given below:

&lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_) + R-X (a.q)\longrightarrow {C^*}-X-R_(s_) + H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_)&lt;/math&gt; is the activated carbon and &lt;math&gt;R-X&lt;/math&gt; is any organic halide.

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;{C^*}-X-R_(s_)

&lt;/math&gt;is the organic halide - activated carbon complex that can be filtered out.

== Treatment ==

=== Physical separation ===
In water treatment plants, organic halides are adsorbed using [[Activated carbon|GAC]] or [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|PAC]] in agitated tanks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The loaded carbon is separated using a membrane made out of materials like polypropylene &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or cellulose nitrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Measuring the AOX levels into and out of the treatment zone shows a drop in organic halide concentrations. Some processes use a two-step [[Activated carbon|GAC]] filtration to remove AOX precursors, and thus reduce the amount of AOX in treated waters.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahala|first=R.|last2=Långvik|first2=V. -A.|last3=Laukkanen|first3=R.|date=1999-01-01|title=Controlling adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and trihalomethanes (THM) formation by ozonation and two-step granule activated carbon (GAC) filtration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122399006630|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=40|issue=9|pages=249–256|doi=10.1016/S0273-1223(99)00663-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two step filtration process consists of two GAC filters in series. The first filter is loaded with exhausted GAC, while the second filter is loaded with fresh GAC. This set up is preferred for its increased efficiency and higher throughput capacity. The GAC is replaced cyclically and the extracted organic halide-carbon mixture is then sent for subsequent biological or chemical treatment such as ozonation to regenerate the GAC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Often, these chemical treatments, while effective, pose economical challenges to the treatment plants.

=== Biological treatment ===
A more economically attractive option for treatment of the organic halides is through utilization of biological agents. Recently, bacteria ''(Ancylobacter aquaticus),'' fungi (''Phanerochaete chrysosporium'' and ''Coiriolus versicolor''), or synthetic enzymes have been used in the degradation of chlorinated organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The microorganisms degrade halocompounds using either aerobic or anaerobic processes. The mechanisms of degradation include utilization of the compound as carbon source for energy, cometabolite, or as an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0102076|title=Biotechnology in the Pulp and Paper Industry|last=Bajpai|first=Pratima|last2=Bajpai|first2=Pramod K.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540618683|editor-last=Eriksson|editor-first=K.-E.

An example of a microbe that can degrade AOX is shown below in Figures 1&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and 2.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=YAMADA|first=Takashi|last2=TAKAHAMA|first2=Yuhki|last3=YAMADA|first3=Yasuhiro|date=2008-05-23|title=Biodegradation of 2,4,6-Tribromophenol by Ochrobactrum sp.

[[File:PCE Degradation Chemistry.jpg|center|frame|Figure 1: Step wise degradation of PCE]]

A sample dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) such as [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (PCE) by ''[[Dehalococcoides|Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' has been illustrated above. PCE is one of the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chunlong|last2=Bennett|first2=George N.|date=2005-01-26|title=Biodegradation of xenobiotics by anaerobic bacteria|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=600–618|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to competition from [[methanogen]]s for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiehm|first=Andreas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Kathrin R|title=Sequential anaerobic/aerobic biodegradation of chloroethenes—aspects of field application|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166911000309|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=415–421|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2011.02.003|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions–PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to [[1,2-Dichloroethene|''cis''-dichloroethene]] (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to [[vinyl chloride]] (VC) and [[ethylene]] are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethylene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as ''[[Desulfomonile]]'', ''[[Dehalobacter]]'', ''[[Desulfuromonas]]''...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] to [[Ethylene|ethene]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In addition to dechlorination of CAHs, microbes have also been reported to act on chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Xueping|last2=Pei|first2=Yong|last3=Su|first3=Jingjing|last4=Qin|first4=Chengrong|last5=Wang|first5=Shuangfei|last6=Nie|first6=Shuangxi|date=2016-07-19|title=Kinetics of Adsorbable Organic Halides (AOX) Reduction in Laccase-Aided Chlorine Dioxide Bleaching of Bagasse Pulp|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_11_3_7462_Song_Kinetics_Adsorbable_Organic_Halides|journal=BioResources|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=7462–7475|doi=10.15376/biores.11.3.7462-7475|issn=1930-2126}}&lt;/ref&gt; While little is known about the dehalogenation mechanisms of polyhalogenated phenols (PHPs) and polyhalogenated benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of [[2,4,6-Tribromophenol|2,4,6-tribromophenol]] (2,4,6-TBP) by ''[[Ochrobactrum|Ochrabactrum]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of ''ortho''-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield [[2,4-Dibromophenol|2,4-dibromophenol]] (2,4-DBP). Since there are two ''ortho'' bromines, debromination of either ''ortho'' carbons would yield the same product . Other species such as ''[[Pseudomonas glathei|Pseudomonas galthei]]'' or ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' showed preference for ''para''-halide over the ''meta''- ''or ortho'' -halides. For example, the ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' degrades [[2,4,6-Trichlorophenol|2,4,6-trichlorophenol]] (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between ''ortho-'' and ''para''-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo-phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the ''para-''carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and [[phenol]] in the final step. [[Phenol]] can be metabolized by microorganisms to make [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] or can be extracted easier than AOXs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Organic halides, [[extractable organic halides]] (EOX), and [[total organic halides]] (TOX) are related content for this topic. EOX provides information on how halides can be extracted using a solvent while TOX provides information about the total organic halide content in the sample. This value can be used to estimate [[Basic oxygen demand]] (BOD) or [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), a key factor in estimating the required oxygen to burn the organic compounds to estimate the percentage of AOX’s and Extractable organic halides.

Books are commonly used to identify animal tracks, which may look different based on the weight of the particular animal and the type of strata in which they are made.&lt;ref name="NT-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Jonah |title=Field Guides to Animal Tracks |url=http://www.naturetracking.com/books/ |date=2014 |work=NatureTracking.com |accessdate=April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracks can be [[Fossil trackway|fossil]]ized over millions of years.&lt;ref name="UCMP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitkus |first1=Allison |last2=Chin |first2=Karen |last3=Lockley |first3=Martin |title=Fossil footprints through geologic time |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/science/trackways/index.php |date= |work=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |accessdate=April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is for this reason we are able to see fossilized dinosaur tracks in some types of rock formations.  These types of fossils are called [[trace fossils]] since they are a trace of an animal left behind rather than the animal itself. In paleontology, tracks often preserve as sandstone infill, forming a natural mold of the track.&lt;ref name="KAP-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milàn, J. |author2=Christiansen, P. |author3=Mateus, O. |title=A three-dimensionally preserved sauropod manus impression from the Upper Jurassic of Portugal: implications for sauropod manus shape and locomotor mechanics. |url=http://docentes.fct.unl.pt/omateus/publications/three-dimensionally-preserved-sauropod-manus-impression-upper-jurassic-portugal |date=2005 |journal=''Kaupia'' |volume=14 |pages=47–52 |accessdate=March 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known for the black stone temple built by the [[Western Chalukya Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2201/stories/20050114000106500.htm |title=The Chalukyan magnificence |publisher= |accessdate=2008-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717210433/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2201/stories/20050114000106500.htm |archivedate=17 July 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Amruteshwara Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:View from the rear of Amritesvara temple at Annigeri.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Amruteshwara Temple in Annigeri]]
Annigeri was an important political and cultural center in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Annigeri was the last capital of the Chalukyas, Someshwara 4 (during 1184-89)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Annigeri comes under the core area of Western Chalukya architectural activity in the modern Karnataka state. The Amrtesvara Temple is the finest examples produced by the Kalyani Chalukyas ([[Western Chalukya architecture]]).

In 1157 the Kalachuris under [[Bijjala II]] captured [[Basavakalyan]] and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their [[capital city]] to Annigeri in the present-day Dharwad district.

To Provide education at the primary and Vedic levels, Annigeri had five Brahmapuris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Annigeri skulls==
In 2010, over 100 human skulls were found in a drain at Annigeri. According to the preliminary theories, the area may have been a mass grave around some 150–200 years ago, or it may have been a battle ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Bride service''' has traditionally been portrayed in the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature as the service rendered by the [[bridegroom]] to a bride's family as a [[bride price]] or part of one (see [[dowry]]).

==Example==
An example of bride service occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16-29|NIV}}, when [[Jacob]] labored for [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] for fourteen years to marry [[Rachel]]. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him [[Leah]] on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

A '''building code''' (also '''building control''' or '''building regulations''') is a set of rules that specify the standards for constructed objects such as [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure]]s. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain [[planning permission]], usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is to protect [[public health]], safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and structures.  The building code becomes [[law]] of a particular jurisdiction when formally [[enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the appropriate governmental or private authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=danQCwAAQBAJ|title=Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2015 International Building Code|last=Ching|first=Francis D.

Building codes are generally intended to be applied by [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, constructors and [[regulatory agency|regulators]] but are also used for various purposes by [[fire safety inspector|safety inspectors]], [[environmental scientist]]s, [[real estate developer]]s, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials, [[insurance]] companies, facility managers, [[leasehold estate|tenants]], and others. Codes regulate the design and construction of structures where adopted into law.

The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies considerably among nations.  In some countries building codes are developed by the government agencies or quasi-governmental [[standards organizations]] and then enforced across the country by the [[central government]]. Such codes are known as the '''national building codes''' (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).

In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire [[safety]] is vested in [[local authorities]], a system of [[model building code]]s is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as ''adoption by reference''. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the [[model building code|model code]] adopted, it is usually required by the [[model building code|model code]] developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.

There are instances when some [[local authorities|local jurisdictions]] choose to develop their own building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the [[United States]] had their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country have chosen to adopt [[model building code|model codes]] instead. For example, in 2008 New York City abandoned its proprietary ''1968 New York City Building Code'' in favor of a customized version of the [[International Building Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml NYC Construction Codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702014751/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml |date=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardnewyork.com/building-code/|title=Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=Vanguard New York|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of [[Chicago]] remains the only [[municipality]] in America that continues to use a building code the city developed on its own as part of the ''[[Municipal Code of Chicago]]''.

In Europe, the [[Eurocode]] is a pan-European building code that has superseded the older national building codes.  Each country now has National Annexes to localize the contents of the Eurocode.

Similarly, in [[India]], each municipality and urban development authority has its own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a [http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm National Building Code], which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating building construction activity.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is included in the [[Code of Hammurabi]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which dates from circa 1772 BC.

The book of [[Deuteronomy]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] stipulated that [[parapet]]s must be constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation.&lt;ref&gt;'Charles II, 1666: An Act for rebuilding the City of London.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819), pp. 603–12. URL: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47390 british-history.ac.uk], date accessed: 08 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn up by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], the Act regulated the rebuilding of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and authorised the [[City of London Corporation]] to reopen and widen roads.&lt;ref&gt;'Book 1, Ch. 15: From the Fire to the death of Charles II', A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 230–55. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46732. Date accessed: 07 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laws of the Indies]] were passed in the 1680s by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] to regulate the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain's worldwide imperial possessions.

The first systematic national building standard was established with the London Building Act of 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of [[chimney]]s, [[fireplace]]s and [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npt.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=478|title=A Brief History of Building Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Buildings Office]] was formed to regulate the construction and use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]].

The City of [[Baltimore]] passed its first building code in 1859. The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] occurred in February, 1904. Subsequent changes were made that matched other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore: The Building of an American City, Sherry H. Olson, Published 1997, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (Md.), {{ISBN|0-8018-5640-X}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.

In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire (1852–70)]], great blocks of apartments were erected&lt;ref name="New International Encyclopedia"&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the height of buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.

== Scope ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Hageman, Jack M., and Brian E. P. Beeston. ''Contractor's guide to the building code''. 6th ed. Carlsbad, CA: Craftsman Book Co., 2008. 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Harry J., and Richard Peck. ''Housing and local government: a research guide for policy makers and planners''. Lexington, Mass. u.a.: Lexington Books, 1974. 53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building codes generally include:
* Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies, fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage &amp; storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy rules, and swimming pool regulations.
* Rules regarding [[parking]] and [[traffic]] impact
* [[Fire code]] rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe evacuation in the event of such an emergency[citation needed]
* Requirements for [[earthquake]] ([[seismic code]]), [[hurricane]], [[flood]], and [[tsunami]] resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure would be catastrophic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
* Energy provisions and consumption
* [[Grandfathering]] provisions: Unless the building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
* [[Specification]]s on components
* Allowable installation methodologies
* Minimum and maximum room and exit sizes and location
* Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
* For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft

Building codes are generally separate from [[zoning]] ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to [[dwelling]]s or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, [[pedestrian]] walkways, [[parking lot]]s, and radio and [[television antenna]]s.

===Energy codes in the United States===

The energy codes of the United States are adopted at the state and municipal levels and are based on the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC). Previously, they were based on the Model Energy Code (MEC).

As of March 2017, the following residential codes have been partially or fully adopted by states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcapcodes.org/code-status/residential/|title=Residential Code Status {{!}} The Building Codes Assistance Project|website=bcapcodes.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Collegio Carlo Alberto''' is a private research and teaching institution, located in the city of [[Turin]], northern Italy, in the [[province of Turin]]. The institution was created in 2004 as a joint initiative of the [[:it:Compagnia di San Paolo|Compagnia di San Paolo]] and the [[University of Turin]], at first located in [[Moncalieri]]. Its mission is to foster research and education in social sciences. President of the Collegio is Pietro Terna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/collegio/about-us/governance/ Governance] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio's research community consists of full-time junior and senior faculty hired on the international academic job market, faculty of the University of Turin, and visiting scholars. They conduct research within the social sciences with both empirical and theoretical emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/research/ Research] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research interactions are fostered by seminar series and scientific conferences. Since 2006 the Collegio has hosted hundreds of international speakers, including Nobel laureates, and leaders of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/events/overview/ Events] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio coordinates the ''Allievi'' Honors Program, organizes five one-year master's degree programs (Economics, Economics and Complexity, Finance, Insurance and Risk Management, Public Policy and Social Change), and hosts two doctoral programs of the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/education/ Education] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
English is the official operating language of the Collegio.

Historically, prior to the 1990s, the ''Collegio Carlo Alberto'' referred to a [[Piedmont]] boys boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realcollegio.carloalberto.org/ History of Real Collego Carlo Alberto] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The school has since closed, but the building retains its name.

In [[graphic design]] and [[advertising]], a '''comprehensive layout''' or '''comprehensive,''' usually shortened to '''comp''', is the [[page layout]] of a proposed design as initially presented by the designer to a client, showing the relative positions of [[typography|text]] and [[illustration]]s before the final content of those elements has been decided upon. The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.

Traditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art creation (e.g., advertisement) are:
* Sketch&amp;nbsp;— the initial idea roughly "sketched out" in order to quickly transfer the idea on to a physical substrate
* Layout&amp;nbsp;— the idea laid out in relative position for further development
* Comp&amp;nbsp;— the idea created in such a way as to closely mimic the final creation, usually as a step toward approval by decision-makers
* Finish&amp;nbsp;— the idea rendered in the appropriate medium for sale, display, or reproduction

For traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for [[computer-generated art]]. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.

With computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media.  Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials to avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a "physical comp" is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing Möbius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from "[[Nitpicking (pastime)|nitpicking]]" the production quality and focus on the design idea.

In the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish render and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the final rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the final version is created.

The illustration element may incorporate [[stock photography]], [[clip art]], or other found material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated, before entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image for the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the hope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a "positional" image) will end up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes mistakenly believed that "comp" is short for "complimentary," as it is in some other promotional contexts.

The word "comp" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may "comp something up"; that is, they will create a comp.  "Comp" may also stand for "composition" or "composite layout".

'''Convia, Inc.''', based in [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois]], is an American [[manufacturer]] of [[Electronic component|components]] which provide an integrated [[energy management]] platform that allows for the control and [[Light meter|metering]] of [[lighting]], [[Plug load meter|plug-loads]] and [[HVAC]]. It is notable as one of the first companies to deliver and control power while at the same time monitoring energy and adapting its use in real-time.

==History==
In the late 1990s, Herman Miller, Inc., Convia’s [[parent company]], realized that they could not create truly flexible environments until the [[infrastructure]] of the building became more flexible. They decided that if a building infrastructure embraced technology then the applications, including [[systems furniture]], could also take advantage of that infrastructure and become more intelligent. The need for intelligent infrastructure led Herman Miller to partner with a leading technology [[think tank]] called [[Applied Minds]] in [[Glendale, California]] and their founder [[Danny Hillis]]. Danny Hillis is considered a pioneer of the [[parallel computing]] industry and is the lead designer of Convia. Convia was launched in 2004.

==Partners==
In 2009, Herman Miller, Inc., and [[Legrand (company)|Legrand North America]], an innovative{{cn|date=January 2018}} manufacturer of [[Electrical infrastructure|electrical]] and network infrastructure [[solution]]s, announced a strategic alliance designed to broaden the reach of energy management strategies to fuel the adoption of flexible, sustainable spaces, ultimately reducing [[real estate]] and building [[operating cost]]s while improving worker [[productivity]]. Under the terms of the agreement, technology from Herman Miller’s Convia, Inc. subsidiary is embedded into Wiremold wire and [[cable management]] systems from Legrand. These include [[Modular power supply|modular power]] and lighting distribution systems, floor boxes, poke-thru devices and architectural columns, which provide flexible, accessible [[power distribution]] to building owners and managers. Convia technology integrates a facility's [[power delivery]] and other infrastructure and technology applications, including lighting, HVAC, and occupancy and [[daylight harvesting]] sensors into an energy efficient, easy-to manage platform. Under the new alliance, “Convia-enabled” Wiremold systems enhanced this capability by adding control and monitoring of office plug loads (the amount of energy drawn by devices from an [[electrical outlet]]) and lighting loads.

Also in 2009, recognizing that workers spend approximately 50 percent of their time away from their desks, Convia developed the Energy Manager for Herman Miller to bring energy management strategies to the [[workstation]]. The system connects building power with the modular power in a cluster of Herman Miller workstations—including Vivo interiors, My Studio Environments, Ethospace system, Prospects, and [[Action Office]] system.

===Three Comprehensive Categories of Knowledge===
[[Image:Universal Categories.jpg|right|thumb|The Three Peircean Categories]]
Using the [[trikonic]] categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness developed by American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Earthscore splits knowledge into three modes of being: firstness (positive quality), secondness (actual fact), and thirdness (laws that will govern facts in the future), and defines these categories as "a theory of everything".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Three Person Solution: Creating Sustainable Collaborative Relationships|author=Ryan, P.|date=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535047|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EQk8oG7wFPUC|page=60|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earthscore3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102039/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=The Earthscore Notational System|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstness is positive quality in the realm of spontaneity, freshness, possibility, and freedom. Earthscore defines firstness as being "as is", without regard for any other. Examples include: the taste of banana, warmth, redness, and feeling gloomy.&lt;ref name="experimentaltvcenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/pview.php3?id=42|title=People &amp;#124; The History Project|publisher=experimentaltvcenter.org|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondness is a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance engendered by being up against brute facts. Earthscore defines secondness as the "facticity", or "thisness", of something, as it exists, here and now, without rhyme or reason. Examples include: pushing against an unlocked door and meeting silent, unseen resistance.&lt;ref name="stichting-mai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716215839/http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-date=2004-07-16|dead-url=yes|title=M.J.Bijvoet - Art As Inquiry|author=Marga Bijvoet|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdness mediates between secondness and firstness, between fact and possibility. ''Earthscore'' defines thirdness as the realm of habit and laws that will govern facts in the future, and posits that a knowledge of thirdness can allow predictions of how certain future events will turn out. It is an 'if...then' sort of knowledge. Thirdness consists in the reality that future facts of secondness will conform to general laws.&lt;ref name="earthscore3"/&gt;

===The Relational Circuit===

The relational circuit is a self-penetrating, tubular continuum with six unambiguous positions which attempts to supply a [[Continuum (topology)|topological continuum]] to the [[trikonic]] categories. The circuit organizes differences in terms of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, and three "in-between" positions that connect them within the continuum. The relational circuit is to the Earthscore System what the staff and bars are to classical music notation, and is the basis of the third component, threeing.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/leonardo/v039/39.3ryan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthscore.org/articles/ed_creating_curriculum_two.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electricity-tool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two:-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710181115/http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two%3A-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-date=2011-07-10|dead-url=yes|title=Component Two: The Relational Circuit-Electricity Tool &amp;#124; electricity tool|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threeing===

Threeing is a practice in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator, in an attempt to solve relational confusion. The roles correspond to the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness. Through role playing, the three individuals interact with each other spontaneously and recursively, following the relational circuit.&lt;ref name="earthscore4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/Curriculae/threeing_curriculum.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102108/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/Curriculae/threeing_curriculum.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=Threeing Relationships|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threeing is further broken down into ten different subsections:&lt;ref name="earthscore5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/threeing/threeing_lesson_intro.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102709/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/threeing/threeing_lesson_intro.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=Introduction to Lessons in Verbal Threeing|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Firstness of Thirdness===

Earthscore utilizes the Firstness of Thirdness as a means of creativity, in an attempt to imagine an ecologically sustainable life before living it. By incorporating pure firstness as the realm of spontaneity, Earthscore uses the disciplines of [[Zen]], [[yoga]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] to cultivate the human capacity to be comfortable in pure firstness and yield new insights and visions.

===The Semiotic System for Interpretation===

Earthscore approaches knowledge as a process of generating signs, and incorporates the semiotic system of Charles Sanders Peirce consistent with the trikonic categories: A sign (firstness) representing an object (secondness) for an interpretant (thirdness). Earthscore exfoliates the threefold division into  a sixty-six-fold classification of signs that is inclusive of everything in nature, in order to systematize both interdisciplinary and multimedia representations of ecosystems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11445">An '''endangered species recovery plan''' is a document describing the current status, threats and intended methods for increasing [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]] population sizes. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973 requires that all species considered endangered must have a plan implemented for their recovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1533|title=16 U.S. Code § 1533 - Determination of endangered species and threatened species|work=LII / Legal Information Institute | accessdate= 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the format is also useful when considering the conservation of any endangered species. Recovery plans act as a foundation from which you can build a conservation effort and they can help to make conservation more effective.&lt;ref name ="Guidance"&gt;{{Cite journal | author =  National Marine Fisheries Service | title = Interim Endangered and Threatened Species Recovery Planning Guidance | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/guidance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The United States congress said in 1973 that endangered species "are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/species/why-save-species.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Species - Why Save Species?|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore set laws to protect endangered species. Section 4(f) of the United States [[Endangered Species Act]] from 1973 directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to develop and implement recovery plans to promote the conservation of endangered and threatened species.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/recovery/|title=Recovery of Species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service are responsible for administering the act. The recovery plan is a document which specifies what research and management actions are necessary to support recovery, but does not itself commit manpower or funds. Recovery plans are used in setting funding priorities and provide direction to local, regional, and state planning efforts. Recovery is when the threats to species survival are neutralized and the species will be able to survive in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esrp.csustan.edu/publications/pubhtml.php?doc=sjvrp&amp;file=cover.html#guide|title=Recovery Plan for Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley, California|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] also create similar documents, Species Action Plans, which are used to outline the conservation strategies of species, normally between set dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |title=IUCN - Species Action Plans |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325163018/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |archivedate=25 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are used to clearly define the status and threats to the species, and set aims for conservation so that parties involved can work towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/action_plans/index_en.htm|title=Species Action Plan - Conservation - Environment - European Commission|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==

[[FIle:Status_ESA.svg|thumb|220px|U.S. Endangered Species Act Categories]]

An [[endangered species]] is a species which is likely to become extinct.
The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] has 17 categories of species status. These categories are used in the documents produced for the U.S. Endangered species act. The categories include:
*Endangered (E) for species “in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Threatened (T) for species “likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Candidate (C) for species currently under consideration
*Species endangered due to “similarity of appearance” (SAE)
*Species of concern (SC) for species that are considered “important to monitor” but have not been categorized as E,T or C
*Delisted species removed from the list due to species recovery or extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/about/listing-status-codes.html|title=Endangered Species Program - About Us - Frequently Asked Questions - Species Status Codes|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species Program|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Status iucn3.1.svg|thumb|right|220px|IUCN red list categories]]

The IUCN also has categories that it uses to classify species, which are more widely used in conservation. These are:
*[[Extinct]] (EX) – there are no individuals remaining of that species at all
*[[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – there are no individuals remaining of that species in the wild at all
*[[Critically Endangered]] (CR) – there is a very high risk that the species will soon go extinct in the wild, for example because there is only a very small population remaining
*[[Endangered]] (EN) – there is a high risk of the species soon becoming extinct in the wild 
*[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – there is a high risk that the species will soon become endangered 
*[[Near threatened]] (NT) – there is a risk that the species will become threatened in the near future
*[[Least concern]] (LC) – there is a low risk that the species will become threatened. This category is used for “widespread and abundant taxa”
*[[Data Deficient]] (DD) – there is not enough data on the species to be able to make a reliable assessment on the status of the species
*[[Not evaluated]] (NE) – the species has not yet been evaluated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1|title=2001 Categories &amp; Criteria (version 3.1)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of a recovery plan==
The recovery plan must contain at least:
#A description of what is needed to return the species to a healthy state
#Criteria for what this healthy state would be, so that the species can be removed from the endangered list when it is achieved
#Estimates of how long the recovery will take and how much it will cost &lt;ref name="noaa.gov"/&gt;

A recovery plan often contains the following sections:
*Background of the species - a description of the species, its taxonomy, population structure and life history. This includes the distribution, food sources, reproduction and abundance
*Threats - the main reasons why the species is now at risk of extinction
*Recovery strategy - details of how the species can be returned to a healthy state, including the goals, timeline, methods and criteria for delisting.&lt;ref name= "Guidance"/&gt;

==Adaptive management==

When recovery plans are carried out well, they do not simply act as stop gaps to prevent extinction, but can restore species to a state of health so they are self-sustaining. There is evidence to suggest that the best plans are adaptive and dynamic, responding to changing conditions. However, [[adaptive management]] requires the system to be constantly monitored so that changes are identified.&lt;ref name="Clark2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Clark JA et. al. | title= Improving U.S. Endangered Species Act Recovery Plans: Key Findings and Recommendations of the SCB Recovery Plan Project | journal=''Conservation Biology'' | volume=16 | year=2002 | pages=1510–1519 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01376.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly this is frequently not done, even for species that have already been [[IUCN Red List|red listed]].&lt;ref name="Grouse"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Storch, I | title= Grouse: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan 2006-2010 | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2007-034.pdf }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The species must be monitored throughout the recovery period (and beyond) to ensure that the plan is working as intended. The framework for this monitoring should be planned before the start of the implementation, and the details included in the recovery plan. Information on how and when the data will be collected should be supplied.&lt;ref name="Bonobo"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Aveling, C. et. al. | title= Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'') | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2012-083.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat conservation plan==

An alternative method of conserving a species is to conserve the habitat that the species is found in. In this process, there is no target species for conservation, but rather the habitat as a whole is protected and managed, often with a view to returning the habitat to a more natural state. In theory, this method of conservation can be beneficial because it allows for the entire ecosystem and the many species within to benefit from conservation, rather than just the single target species.&lt;ref name="Rohlf1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Rohlf, DJ. | title= Six Biological Reasons Why the Endangered Species Act Doesn't Work - And What to Do About It | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=5 | year=1991 | pages=273–282 | jstor=2385897 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1991.tb00139.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] suggest there is evidence that habitat based approaches do not have enough focus on individual species to protect them sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |title=IUCN - Conservation Planning |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215803/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However much research now is turning towards area-based strategies in preference to individual species approaches such as endangered species recovery plans.&lt;ref name= "Rohlf1991"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10941">An '''equivalence group''' is a set of unspecified cells that have the same developmental potential or ability to adopt various [[Cell fate determination|fates]]. Our{{Who|date=October 2012}} current understanding suggests that equivalence groups are limited to cells of the same ancestry, also known as sibling cells.&lt;ref name=satoh89&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida and Satoh|title=Determination and regulation in the pigment cell lineage of the ascidian embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=132|issue=2 |pages=355–67|year=1989 |pmid=2494088 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(89)90232-7 |last2=Satoh |first2=N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, cells of an equivalence group adopt different fates from one another.&lt;ref name=greenwald&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwald and Rubin|title=Making a difference: the role of cell-cell interactions in establishing separate identities for equivalent cells|journal=Cell|volume=68|issue=2|pages=271–81|year=1992|pmid=1365402 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90470-W |last2=Rubin |first2=GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalence groups assume various potential fates in two general, non-mutually exclusive ways.  One mechanism, induction, occurs when a signal originating from outside of the equivalence group specifies a subset of the naïve cells.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;  Another mode, known as [[lateral inhibition]], arises when a signal within an equivalence group causes one cell to adopt a dominant fate while others in the group are inhibited from doing so.&lt;ref name=Nishida97&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida|title=Notch homologue from Halocynthia roretzi is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system during ascidian embryogenesis|journal=Dev Genes Evol|volume=207|pages=371–380|year=1997|doi=10.1007/s004270050126 |last2=Saitoh |first2=Takashi |last3=Matsumoto |first3=Midori |last4=Makabe |first4=Kazuhiro W. |last5=Nishida |first5=H. |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many examples of equivalence groups, both induction and lateral inhibition are used to define patterns of distinct cell types.  

Cells of an equivalence group that do not receive a signal adopt a default fate.  Alternatively, cells that receive a signal take on different fates.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang and Weisblat|title=Cell fate determination in an annelid equivalence group|journal=Development|volume=122|issue=6|pages=1839–47|year=1996|pmid=8674423 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a certain point, the fates of cells within an equivalence group become irreversibly determined, thus they lose their [[multipotent]] potential.  The following provides examples of equivalence groups studied in [[nematodes]] and [[ascidians]].

==Vulva Precursor Cell Equivalence Group==

===Introduction===
A classic example of an equivalence group is the vulva precursor cells (VPCs) of nematodes.  In ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' self-fertilized eggs exit the body through the [[vulva]].  This organ develops from a subset of cell of an equivalence group consisting of six VPCs, P3.p-P8.p, which lie ventrally along the anterior-posterior axis.&lt;ref name=Kornfeld&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kornfeld|title=Vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Trends Genet|volume=13|issue=2 |pages=55–61|year=1997|pmid=9055606 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(97)01005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example a single overlying somatic cells, the anchor cell, induces nearby VPCs to take on vulva fates 1° (P6.p) and 2° (P5.p and P7.p).  VPCs that are not induced form the 3° lineage (P3.p, P4.p and P8.p), which make epidermal cells that fuse to a large syncytial epidermis (see image).&lt;ref name=Sternberg86&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg and Horvitz|title=Pattern formation during vulval development in C. elegans|journal=Cell|volume=44|issue=5 |pages=761–72|year=1986|pmid=3753901 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90842-1 |last2=Horvitz |first2=HR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six VPCs form an equivalence group because all of the six cells are competent to take on any of the available fates (1°, 2°, and 3°) dependent on their proximity to the anchor cell.  Ablation experiments indicate that all VPCs are able to adopt vulva fates.  For example, if the P6.p cell that normally becomes 1° is ablated then the VPC closest to the anchor cell, either P5.p or P7.p, assumes the 1° fate.  Furthermore, if all VPCs are destroyed except the most anterior P3.p cell then the anchor cell designates this cell the 1° fate.  However, if the anchor cell is killed, in the absence of an inductive signal, then all of the VPCs assume the default 3° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg|title=Vulva Development|journal=Sternberg|volume=25|pages=1–28|year=2005|pmid=18050418|doi=10.1895/wormbook.1.6.1|pmc=4781130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular Mechanism===
The anchor cell directly induces the vulva fates by secreting the [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF)-like ligand LIN-3.  The P6.p cell receives the LIN-3 signal via the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] LET-23 (P5.p and P7.p also receive LIN-3 but to a lesser extent).  Activation of LET-23 in P6.p results in the activation of LIN-12 ([[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]]) in P5.p and P7.p.  Experimental evidence shows that LIN-12 is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the 2° fate.  Through lateral inhibition LIN-12 prevents the P5.p and P7.p cells from adopting the 1° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook /&gt;  Thus, in this example both inductive EGF signaling and lateral Notch activation patterns the VPC equivalence group.

==Ascidian Pigment Precursor Equivalence Group==

[[Image:Otolith Ocellus.png|thumb|400px|alt=Otolith and Ocellus|Two bilateral pigment precursor cells form an equivalence group that eventually interacts to seal mutually exclusive fates (otolith and ocellus). Shown is a timeline of the developing Halocythia roretzi embryo (anterior is to the left). Pigment precursor cells (gray circles) remain equivalent until they align after neurulation. At 21 hours post fertilization the ocellus (white circle) and otolith (black circle) are determined.]]

===Introduction===
The larvae of ascidians (sea squirts) contain a pair of sensory [[melanocyte|pigment cells]] known as the [[otolith]] and [[ocellus]].  The otolith is used to sense gravity, whereas the ocellus responds to light.  During embryogenesis the otolith and ocellus develop from two bilateral equivalent precursors.  Either the left or right pigment precursor cell has equal probability of developing into the otolith or ocellus.  The decision to adopt either fate is determined after neural tube closure during the early tailbud stage (see image), via a poorly defined mechanism of induction.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  

During normal development, after [[neural tube]] closure, the pigment precursors align dorsally along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube.  Whichever cell aligns anteriorly will become the otolith, while the posterior cell will form the ocellus.  In the absence of cell-cell interactions both cells develop into ocelli, which is the default fate.&lt;ref name=Nishida97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Akanuma&gt;{{cite journal |author=Akanuma|title=Notch signaling is involved in nervous system formation in ascidian embryos|journal=Development Genes and Evolution|volume=212|issue=10|pages=459–72|year=2002|pmid=12424517|doi=10.1007/s00427-002-0264-x |display-authors=1 |last2=Hori |first2=Sawako |last3=Darras |first3=S&amp;#x000E9;Bastien |last4=Nishida |first4=Hiroki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental Methods for Studying Equivalence in ''Halocynthia roretzi''===
To elucidate whether the fates of the otolith and ocellus are determined in the early embryo or after the precursors align during neural tube closure, ablation and drug treatment techniques were used in the ascidian species ''[[Sea pineapple|Halocythia roretzi]]''. 

Cells that are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FDX) can be selectively photoablated by fluorescent excitation.&lt;ref name=Shankland&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shankland and Weisblat|title=Stepwise commitment of blast cell fates during the positional specification of the O and P cell lines in the leech embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=106|issue=2|pages=326–42|year=1984|pmid=6500176 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(84)90231-8 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When one FDX labeled pigment precursor cells is photoablated during the mid-neurula stage (15 hrs) the other will almost always develop into an ocellus.  However, if the ablations are performed during the late tailbud stage (22.5 hrs) then the remaining cell has an equal likelihood of becoming an otolith or ocellus.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt; 

Inhibiting cell division and [[morphogenesis]] with [[cytochalasin B]] is another method used to determine when the pigment precursor equivalence group is specified.  Cytochalasin treatment of early tailbud stage embryos (17 hrs), while the two bilateral cells are still separated, results in both cells becoming ocelli.  When the drug was used after the two cells aligned at the dorsal midline, the anterior cell developed into the otolith and the posterior cell became the ocellus without exception.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  Both experiments suggest that fates of the pigment precursor cells are irreversibly determined by approximately the mid-tailbud stage (21 hrs).

==Other Equivalence Groups==

Equivalence groups have also been described in the [[ganglion]] mother cells in grasshopper and the O/P [[teloblasts]] in the [[leech]].&lt;ref name="Kuwada and Goodman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuwada and Goodman|title=Neuronal determination during embryonic development of the grasshopper nervous system|journal=Dev Biol|volume=110|issue=1|pages=114–26|year=1985|pmid=4007260 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(85)90069-7 |last2=Goodman |first2=CS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuo and Shankland|title=Evolutionary diversification of specification mechanisms within the O/P equivalence group of the leech genus Helobdella|journal=Development|volume=131|issue=23|pages=5859–69|year=2004|pmid=15525668|doi=10.1242/dev.01452 |last2=Shankland |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other instances of equivalence groups, progeny cells are born equivalent and become specified through cell interactions.  Equivalence groups are a common theme in the development of many organisms from diverse [[Phylum|phyla]].

      <comment>c/e. Power plants &amp; factories with once-through cooling systems don't use cooling towers or intake towers; see the diagram. Fish screens are used in all kinds of intake systems.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8203">[[File:Fish screen-Redlands Canal.jpg|thumb|right|Fish screen at Redlands Canal, near [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]]]
A '''fish screen''' is designed to prevent [[fish]] from swimming or being drawn into an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water intake]], [[intake tower]], [[dam]] or other diversion on a [[river]], [[lake]] or waterway where water is taken for human use. They are intended to supply debris-free water without harming aquatic life. Fish screens are typically installed to protect [[endangered species]] of fishes that would otherwise be harmed or killed when passing through industrial facilities such as [[steam electric power plant]]s, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[electrical generator|generator]]s, [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, farm [[irrigation]] water and municipal [[water purification|drinking water treatment]] plants. However, many fish are killed or injured on screens or elsewhere in the intake structures.

==Design==
Fish screens may be '''positive barriers''' (devices such as a perforated metal plate that physically prevents fish from passing) or '''behavioral barriers''' (devices that encourage fish to swim away). Most behavioral barriers are experimental and of unproven effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD"&gt;{{cite report |date=2004 |title=Technical Development Document for the Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule |chapter=Chapter 4. Efficacy of Cooling Water Intake Structure Technologies |url=https://www.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes/support-documents-phase-ii-cooling-water-intake-rule-2004-withdrawn |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 821-R-04-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 4–19}}

[[File:Cooling water intake &amp; travelling screens.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of typical vertical traveling screens used with industrial cooling water intake structures]]
Positive barriers are often effective at keeping aquatic organisms from entering a cooling system, but may also kill them by impinging them on the screens.&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite news |title=One Fish, Two Fish, 46 Million Lake Erie Dead Fish |author=Schmitz, Christy |url= |newspaper=Toledo City Paper |publisher=Adams Street Publishing Co. |location=Toledo, OH |date=2009-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These barrier types are widely used and include:
* Modified traveling screens
* Fish handling and return systems
* Horizontal, flat-plate screens with bypass water return systems
* Cylindrical wedgewire screens
* Fine-mesh screens
* Fish net barriers.
Besides simply preventing fish from passing, fish screens are designed to minimize stress and injury that occur when fish impact the screen or are subjected to changes in water velocity and direction caused by the diversion.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4-3ff}}

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has evaluated other barrier technologies and identified some as potentially effective, although not widely demonstrated (as of 2004):
* Aquatic microfiltration barriers
* Angled and modular inclined screens
* Velocity caps.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4–15ff}}

Some fish screens are designed to protect a single species of fish (for example, [[salmon]]) and are not necessarily effective at protecting other fish species. Some screens are capable of protecting more than one species or type of life. Additionally, some screens may effectively protect juvenile and adult fish, but not fish eggs and [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="EPA 2002"&gt;EPA (2002). "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System—Proposed Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Phase II Existing Facilities; Proposed Rule." {{USFR|67|17136}}. 2002-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a fish screen varies from thousands of US dollars for small, low-flow-rate screens to millions of US dollars in the case of very large custom-designed systems that filter a large flow of water. Maintenance costs can be significant, including repairs, removing trash, and adjusting the equipment for changes in stream conditions.

For some low volume, non-industrial water diversion applications, there are screens available that have no moving parts, do not require electricity, and have very little need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Farmers Screen |url=http://farmerscreen.org/farmers-screen/about/intro/|publisher=Farmers Conservation Alliance |location=Hood River, OR |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on aquatic life==
[[File:Indian Point.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in New York. Over a billion fish eggs and larvae are killed in its cooling system each year.]]
Many power plants and other industries in the U.S. continue to use screens that impinge fish. For example, the cooling system at the [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGeehan |first=Patrick |date=2015-05-12 |title=Fire Prompts Renewed Calls to Close the Indian Point Nuclear Plant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/nyregion/fire-prompts-renewed-calls-to-close-the-indian-point-nuclear-plant.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Bay Shore Power Plant in [[Ohio]], 46 million fish were killed over an 18-month period.&lt;ref name="Schmitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite news |title=FirstEnergy to install devices to divert fish |first=Tom |last=Henry |url=http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2010/03/30/FirstEnergy-to-install-devices-to-divert-fish.html |newspaper=Toledo Blade |date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that pass through the screens are killed or stressed (depending on the species) as they become entrained in the cooling system.&lt;ref name="EPA 2002" /&gt; 208 million fish eggs and over 2 billion small and larval fish were entrained at the Bay Shore plant over the same 18 months.&lt;ref name="Henry" /&gt; EPA estimates that billions of fish and other organisms are killed each year in cooling water intakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2014 |title=Fact Sheet: Final Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Existing Facilities |url=https://www.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes/support-documents-final-rule-existing-electric-generating-plants-and-factories |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 821-F-14-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==
In the [[United States]], the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], a division of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], mandates positive-barrier fishscreens in most new diversions from waterways where endangered or threatened fish species occur. Some existing unscreened diversions whose construction pre-dates fish-screen mandates are allowed to continue operating by [[grandfather clause|grandfather rule]].

'''Fractography''' is the study of the fracture surfaces of materials. Fractographic methods are routinely used to determine the cause of failure in engineering structures, especially in product failure and the practice of [[forensic engineering]] or [[failure analysis]]. In [[material science]] research, fractography is used to develop and evaluate theoretical models of crack growth behavior.

One of the aims of fractographic examination is to determine the cause of failure by studying the characteristics of a fractured surface.  Different types of crack growth (e.g. [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[stress corrosion cracking]], [[hydrogen embrittlement]]) produce characteristic features on the surface, which can be used to help identify the failure mode. The overall pattern of cracking can be more important than a single crack, however, especially in the case of brittle materials like [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]]es.

==Methods==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|right|Crankshaft fatigue fracture]]
An important aim of fractography is to establish and examine the origin of cracking, as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation.  Initial fractographic examination is commonly carried out on a macro scale utilising low power [[optical microscopy]] and oblique lighting techniques to identify the extent of cracking, possible modes and likely origins. Optical microscopy or [[macrophotography]] are often enough to pinpoint the nature of the failure and the causes of crack initiation and growth if the loading pattern is known. 

Common features that may cause crack initiation are [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s, [[Cavitation|void]]s or empty holes in the material, [[contamination]], and [[stress concentration]]s.  "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a surface defect near the bulb at lower centre, the single brittle crack growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]].  The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to the origin of the fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was faulty when loaded, or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.
[[Image:Fractured breast implant.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fractured breast implant catheter in SEM]]
A [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]] is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the [[catheter]] on a [[breast implant]] in [[silicone rubber]]. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.
===USB Microscopy===
[[USB microscope]]s are especially useful for examining fracture surface features since they are small enough to be hand-held. A variety of camera sizes and resolution are available commercially at low cost. The camera cable plugs into the computer via a [[USB]] plug and most such devices come with illumination at the camera supplied by [[LED light]]s.
==Fracture surface map==
[[Image:Fract map1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fracture map of failed breast implant]]
A schematic fracture surface map is a valuable result of visual or microscopic examination. It seeks to isolate and identify the features on the surface which show how the product failed. Such a map can be a valuable way of presenting information which shows clearly how a crack was initiated which grew with time. In the case of the failed breast implant catheter, the crack path was very simple, but the cause more subtle. Further [[scanning electron microscopy]] showed numerous microcracks between the bag and the catheter, indicating that the adhesive bond between the two components had failed prematurely, perhaps through faulty manufacture. The material of construction of both bag and catheter, silicone rubber is a physically weak elastomer, and product design must allow for the low tear or [[shear strength]] of the material.

==Scanning electron microscopy==
{{Main|Scanning Electron Microscopy}}
In many cases, fractography requires examination at a finer scale, which is usually carried out in a scanning electron microscope or SEM. The resolution is much higher than the optical microscope, although samples are examined in a partial vacuum and colour is absent. Improved SEM's now allow examination at near atmospheric pressures, so allowing examination of sensitive materials such as  those of biological origin. 
The SEM is especially useful when combined with [[Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or EDX, which can be performed in the microscope, so very small areas of the sample can be analysed for their elemental composition.

==Applications==

Fractography is a widely used technique in [[forensic engineering]], [[forensic materials engineering]] and [[fracture mechanics]] to understand the causes of failures and also to verify theoretical failure predictions with real life failures. It is of use in [[forensic science]] for analysing broken products which have been used as weapons, such as broken bottles for example. Thus a defendant might claim that a bottle was faulty and broke accidentally when it impacted a victim of an assault. Fractography could show the allegation to be false, and that considerable force was needed to smash the bottle before using the broken end as a weapon to deliberately attack the victim. [[Bullet]] holes in glass [[windscreen]]s or windows can also indicate the direction of impact and the energy of the projectile. In these cases, the overall pattern of cracking is vital to reconstructing the sequence of events, rather than the specific characteristics of a single crack. Fractography can determine whether a cause of train derailment was a faulty rail, or if a wing of a plane had fatigue cracks before a crash.

Fractography is used also in materials research, since fracture properties can correlate with other properties and with structure of materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16284">'''Groundwater remediation''' is the process that is used to treat [[groundwater pollution|polluted groundwater]] by removing the pollutants or converting them into harmless products. [[Groundwater]] is water present below the ground surface that saturates the pore space in the subsurface. Globally, between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the world's [[drinking water]] is drawn from boreholes and dug [[water well|well]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228024655/http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater is also used by farmers to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and by industries to produce everyday goods. Most groundwater is clean, but groundwater can become polluted, or contaminated as a [[human impact on the environment|result of human activities]] or as a result of natural conditions.

The many and diverse activities of humans produce innumerable [[waste]] materials and by-products. Historically, the disposal of such waste have not been subject to many regulatory controls. Consequently, waste materials have often been disposed of or stored on land surfaces where they percolate into the underlying groundwater. As a result, the contaminated groundwater is unsuitable for use.

Current practices can still impact groundwater, such as the over application of [[fertilizer]] or [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical spill|spills]] from [[industrialization|industrial]] operations, infiltration from [[urban runoff]], and leaking from [[landfill]]s. Using contaminated groundwater causes hazards to [[public health]] through [[poisoning]] or the spread of disease, and the practice of groundwater remediation has been developed to address these issues. Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Pollutants and contaminants can be removed from groundwater by applying various techniques, thereby bringing the water to a standard that is commensurate with various intended uses.

== Techniques ==
Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical [[water treatment|treatment]] technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include [[bioaugmentation]], [[bioventing]], [[biosparging]], [[bioslurping]], and [[phytoremediation]]. Some chemical treatment techniques include [[ozone and oxygen gas injection]], [[chemical precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]], [[ion exchange]], [[carbon absorption]], [[aqueous chemical oxidation]], and [[surfactant enhanced recovery]]. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using [[nanoremediation|nanomaterials]]. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, [[pump and treat]], [[air sparging]], and [[dual phase extraction]].

=== Biological treatment technologies ===

==== Bioaugmentation ====
If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the [[bioremediation]] system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Hayman, M, &amp; Dupont, R. R. (2001). Groundwater and Soil Remediation: Process Design and Cost Estimating of Proven Technologies. Reston, Virginia: ASCE Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bioventing ====
Bioventing is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses [[microorganism]]s to biodegrade [[organic matter|organic]] constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of [[hydrocarbon]]s by inducing air or [[oxygen]] flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akaya FAQs|url = http://www.akayaenvironmental.com/faqs.html|website = Akaya|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bioven.htm "Bioventing"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biosparging ====
Biosparging is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the saturated zone. In biosparging, air (or oxygen) and nutrients (if needed) are injected into the [[saturated zone]] to increase the biological activity of the indigenous microorganisms. Biosparging can be used to reduce concentrations of [[petroleum]] constituents that are dissolved in groundwater, adsorbed to [[soil]] below the [[water table]], and within the [[capillary fringe]].

==== Bioslurping ====
Bioslurping combines elements of bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water ([[light non-aqueous phase liquid]] or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a “slurp” tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw in a glass draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, off the top of the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term “bioslurping” refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bislurp.htm "Bioslurping"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoremediation ====
In the [[phytoremediation]] process [[:Category:Phytoremediation plants|certain plants and trees]] are planted, whose roots absorb contaminants from ground water over time. This process can be carried out in areas where the roots can tap the ground water. Few examples of plants that are used in this process are [[Chinese Ladder fern]] Pteris vittata, also known as the brake fern, is a highly efficient accumulator of [[arsenic]]. Genetically altered [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] trees are good absorbers of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and transgenic Indian mustard plants soak up [[selenium]] well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Robert. [http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/groundwaterremediation.html "Groundwater Remediation"], 2008-12-23. Retrieved on 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Certain types of [[permeable reactive barriers]] utilize biological organisms in order to remediate groundwater.

=== Chemical treatment technologies ===

==== Chemical precipitation ====
[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Chemical precipitation]] is commonly used in [[wastewater treatment]] to remove [[Water hardness|hardness]] and [[heavy metals]]. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering.

==== Ion exchange ====
[[Ion exchange]] for ground water remediation is virtually always carried out by passing the water downward under pressure through a fixed bed of granular medium (either cation exchange media and anion exchange media) or spherical beads. [[Cations]] are displaced by certain cations from the solutions and [[ions]] are displaced by certain anions from the solution. Ion exchange media most often used for remediation are [[zeolite]]s (both natural and synthetic) and synthetic resins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

==== Carbon absorption ====
The most common activated carbon used for remediation is derived from [[bituminous coal]]. [[Activated carbon]] absorbs volatile organic compounds from ground water by chemically binding them to the carbon atoms.

==== Chemical oxidation ====
In this process, called [[In situ oxidation|In Situ Chemical Oxidation]] or ISCO, chemical [[oxidant]]s are delivered in the subsurface to destroy (converted to water and carbon dioxide or to nontoxic substances) the organics molecules. The oxidants are introduced as either liquids or gasses. Oxidants include air or oxygen, [[ozone]], and certain liquid chemicals such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[permanganate]] and [[persulfate]].
[[Ozone and oxygen]] gas can be generated on site from air and electricity and directly injected into soil and groundwater contamination. The process has the potential to oxidize and/or enhance naturally occurring aerobic degradation. Chemical oxidation has proven to be an effective technique for [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] or DNAPL when it is present.

==== Surfactant enhanced recovery ====
Surfactant enhanced recovery increases the mobility and solubility of the  contaminants absorbed to the saturated soil matrix or present as [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]. Surfactant-enhanced recovery injects [[surfactant]]s (surface-active agents that are primary ingredient in soap and detergent) into contaminated  groundwater. A typical system uses an extraction pump to remove groundwater downstream from the injection point. The extracted groundwater is treated aboveground to separate the injected surfactants from the contaminants and groundwater. Once the surfactants have separated from the groundwater they are re-used. The surfactants used are non-toxic, food-grade, and biodegradable. Surfactant enhanced recovery is used most often when the groundwater is contaminated by [[dense non-aqueous phase liquids]] (DNAPLs). These dense compounds, such as [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), sink in groundwater because they have a higher density than water. They then act as a continuous source for [[contaminant plume]]s that can stretch for miles within an aquifer. These compounds may biodegrade very slowly. They are commonly found in the vicinity of the original spill or leak where capillary forces have trapped them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/surfenh.htm "Surfactant Enhanced Recovery"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Some permeable reactive barriers utilize chemical processes to achieve groundwater remediation.

=== Physical treatment technologies ===

==== Pump and treat ====
Pump and treat is one of the most widely used ground water remediation technologies. In this process ground water is pumped to the surface and is coupled with either biological or chemical treatments to remove the impurities.

==== Air sparging ====
Air sparging is the process of blowing air directly into the ground water. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air (i.e., stripping) and are carried up into the unsaturated zone (i.e., soil). As the contaminants move into the soil, a [[soil vapor extraction]] system is usually used to remove vapors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/airspa.htm "Air Sparging"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dual phase vacuum extraction ====
Dual-phase vacuum extraction (DPVE), also known as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from above and below the water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the [[capillary fringe]], is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the [[capillary fringe]] is often the most contaminated area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/dualphex.htm "Dual Phase Extraction"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monitoring-Well Oil Skimming ====
Monitoring-wells are often drilled for the purpose of collecting ground water samples for analysis. These wells, which are usually six inches or less in diameter, can also be used to remove hydrocarbons from the contaminant plume within a groundwater aquifer by using a belt-style oil skimmer. Belt oil skimmers, which are simple in design, are commonly used to remove oil and other floating hydrocarbon contaminants from industrial water systems.

A monitoring-well oil skimmer remediates various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or kerosene to heavy products such as No. 6 oil, creosote and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for [[hydrocarbon]] liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that [[DNAPL]] hydrocarbons settle at the bottom of a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer.

Typically, belt skimmers remove very little water with the contaminant, so simple weir-type separators can be used to collect any remaining hydrocarbon liquid, which often makes the water suitable for its return to the aquifer. Because the small electric motor uses little electricity, it can be powered from [[solar panels]] or a [[wind turbine]], making the system self-sufficient and eliminating the cost of running electricity to a remote location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateronline.com/article.mvc/The-Alternative-To-Pump-And-Treat-0001 "The Alternative To Pump And Treat"] Bob Thibodeau, Water Online Magazine, December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy and medieval temporal finitism==
In [[medieval philosophy]], there was much debate over whether the universe had a finite or infinite past (see [[Temporal finitism]]). The philosophy of [[Aristotle]] held that the universe had an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who were unable to reconcile the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] conception of the eternal with the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[Creation according to Genesis|view of creation]].&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gersonides' Proofs for the Creation of the Universe|author=Seymour Feldman|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=35|date=1967|pages=113–137|doi=10.2307/3622478|publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 35|jstor=3622478}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the universe having a finite past were developed by [[John Philoponus]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], among others.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 [165–6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1225 treatise ''De Luce'' (''On Light''), English theologian [[Robert Grosseteste]] explored the nature of matter and the cosmos. He described the birth of the universe in an explosion and the crystallization of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. ''De Luce'' is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140313]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, [[Johannes Kepler]] used the dark night sky to argue for a finite universe. Seventy-seven years later, [[Isaac Newton]] described large-scale motion throughout the universe.

The description of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by [[Erasmus Darwin]]. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848  essay titled ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''; it is obviously not a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge. Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.

According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single "Primordial Particle". "Divine Volition", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason [[Poe]] anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.&lt;ref name=Cappi&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Edgar Allan Poe's Physical Cosmology|first=Alberto|last=Cappi|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=35|date=1994|pages=177–192|bibcode=1994QJRAS..35..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early 20th century scientific developments==
Observationally, in the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] and later, [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]], determined that most spiral nebulae (now correctly called [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]) were receding from Earth. Slipher used [[spectroscopy]] to investigate the rotation periods of planets, the composition of planetary atmospheres, and was the first to observe the radial velocities of galaxies. Wirtz observed a systematic redshift of nebulae, which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmology in which the universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae. They weren't aware of the cosmological implications, nor that the supposed nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Also in that decade, [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] was found to admit no [[static universe|static cosmological solutions]], given the basic assumptions of cosmology described in the [[Big Bang#Theoretical underpinnings|Big Bang's theoretical underpinnings]]. The universe (i.e., the space-time metric) was described by a [[metric tensor]] that was either expanding or shrinking (i.e., was not constant or invariant). This result, coming from an evaluation of the field equations of the general theory, at first led Einstein himself to consider that his formulation of the field equations of the general theory may be in error, and he tried to correct it by adding a [[cosmological constant]].  This constant would restore to the general theory's description of space-time an invariant metric tensor for the fabric of space/existence.  The first person to seriously apply general relativity to cosmology without the stabilizing cosmological constant was [[Alexander Friedmann]]. Friedmann derived the expanding-universe solution to general relativity field equations in 1922. Friedmann's 1924 papers included "''Über die Möglichkeit einer Welt mit konstanter negativer Krümmung des Raumes''" (''About the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature'') which was published by the Berlin Academy of Sciences on 7 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1922 |title=Über die Krümmung des Raumes |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=377–386 |doi=10.1007/BF01332580 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F }} (English translation in: Gen.

&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann's equations describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] universe.

In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] proposed an expanding model for the universe to explain the observed redshifts of spiral nebulae, and calculated the [[Hubble law]]. He based his theory on the work of Einstein and [[De Sitter]], and independently derived Friedmann's equations for an expanding universe.  Also, the red shifts themselves were not constant, but varied in such manner as to lead to the conclusion that there was a definite relationship between amount of red-shift of nebulae, and their distance from observers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided a comprehensive observational foundation for Lemaître's theory. Hubble's experimental observations discovered that, relative to the Earth and all other observed bodies, galaxies are receding in every direction at velocities (calculated from their observed red-shifts) directly proportional to their distance from the Earth and each other. In 1929, Hubble and [[Milton Humason]] formulated the empirical Redshift Distance Law of galaxies, nowadays known as [[Hubble's law]], which, once the redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein's General Relativity Equations for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space.  The isotropic nature of the expansion was direct proof that it was the space (the fabric of existence) itself that was expanding, not the bodies in space that were simply moving further outward and apart into an infinitely larger preexisting empty void. It was this interpretation that led to the concept of the expanding universe. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. This discovery later resulted in the formulation of the Big Bang model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1931, Lemaître proposed in his "''hypothèse de l'atome primitif''" (hypothesis of the primeval atom) that the universe began with the "explosion" of the "primeval [[atom]]" — what was later called the Big Bang. Lemaître first took [[cosmic ray]]s to be the remnants of the event, although it is now known that they originate within the local [[galaxy]]. Lemaître had to wait until shortly before his death to learn of the discovery of [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], the remnant radiation of a dense and hot phase in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georges Lemaître, Father of the Big Bang |url=http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117044852/http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Bang theory vs. Steady State theory===
Hubble's Law suggested that the universe was expanding, contradicting the [[cosmological principle]] whereby the universe, when viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, has no preferred directions or preferred places.  Hubble's idea allowed for two opposing hypotheses to be suggested. One was Lemaître's Big Bang, advocated and developed by [[George Gamow]]. The other model was [[Fred Hoyle]]'s [[Steady State theory]], in which new matter would be created as the galaxies moved away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. It was actually Hoyle who coined the name of Lemaître's theory, referring to it  as "this 'big bang' idea" during a radio broadcast on 28 March 1949, on the [[BBC]] [[Third Programme]]. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hoyle repeated the term in further broadcasts in early 1950, as part of a series of five lectures entitled ''The Nature of The Universe''. The text of each lecture was published in [[The Listener (British magazine)|''The Listener'']] a week after the broadcast, the first time that the term "big bang" appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;The book in question can [no longer] be downloaded here: [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309093139/html/136.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence in favour of the Big Bang model mounted, and the consensus became widespread, Hoyle himself, albeit somewhat reluctantly, admitted to it by formulating a new cosmological model that other scientists later referred to as the "Steady Bang".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., Just Six Minutes, Orion Books, London (2003), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950 to 1990s==
[[File:WMAP power spectrum.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Comparison of the predictions of the standard Big Bang model with experimental measurements. The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy is plotted in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]) (top).]]

From around 1950 to 1965, the support for these theories was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising from the fact that the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as [[quasars]] and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and [[physical paradox|physically paradoxical]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as [[Richard Tolman]]'s [[oscillating universe]]. In the sixties, [[Stephen Hawking]] and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of [[quantum gravity]], there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, most cosmologists accepted the Big Bang, but several puzzles remained, including the non-discovery of anisotropies in the CMB, and occasional observations hinting at deviations from a black-body spectrum; thus the theory was not very strongly confirmed.

==1990 onwards==
Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the 1990s and the early 21st century, as a result of major advances in [[telescope]] technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data, such as [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[WMAP]]. 

In 1990, measurements from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite showed that the spectrum of the CMB matches a 2.725 K [[black-body]] to very high precision; deviations do not exceed 2 parts in {{val|100000}}. This showed that earlier claims of spectral deviations were incorrect, and essentially proved that the universe was hot and dense in the past, since no other known mechanism can produce a black-body to such high accuracy. Further observations from COBE in 1992 discovered the very small anisotropies of the CMB on large scales, approximately as predicted from Big Bang models with [[dark matter]]. From then on, models of [[non-standard cosmology]] without some form of Big Bang became very rare in the mainstream astronomy journals.

In 1998, measurements of distant supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this was supported by other observations including ground-based CMB observations and large galaxy redshift surveys. In 1999-2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] and Maxima balloon-borne
CMB observations showed that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, then in 2001 the
[[2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey estimated the mean matter density around 25-30 percent of critical density. 
 
From 2003 to 2010, [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] spacecraft took very detailed pictures of the universe by means of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and the [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflationary theory]] are correct. No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic microwave background, the observed higher abundance of [[active galaxies|active galactic nuclei]] in the early universe and the observed masses of [[clusters of galaxies]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2013 and 2015, ESA's [[Planck_(spacecraft)|Planck]] spacecraft released even more detailed images of the cosmic microwave background, showing consistency with the [[Lambda-CDM model]] to still higher precision. 

Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding what happened in the earliest times after the Big Bang, and reconciling observations with the basic theory. Cosmologists continue to calculate many of the parameters of the Big Bang to a new level of precision, and carry out more detailed observations which are hoped to provide clues to the nature of [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]], and to test the theory of [[General Relativity]] on cosmic scales.

Its main features are that it is [[Direct method (computational mathematics)|direct]] (that is, non-iterative) and that it mathematically guarantees a consistent selection of the correct operative branch of the multivalued problem, also signalling the condition of voltage collapse when there is no solution. These properties are relevant not only for the reliability of existing off-line and real-time applications, but also because they enable new types of analytical tools that would be impossible to build with existing iterative load flow methods (due to their convergence problems). An example of this would be [[decision support software|decision-support tools]] providing validated action plans in real time.

A detailed description was presented at the 2012 IEEE PES General Meeting and subsequently published.&lt;ref name="helmpaper"&gt;A. Trias, "The Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method", ''IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011'', 22–26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The method is founded on advanced concepts and results from [[complex analysis]], such as [[Holomorphic function|holomorphicity]], the theory of [[algebraic curve]]s, and [[analytic continuation]]. However, the numerical implementation is rather straightforward as it uses standard linear algebra and the [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]]. Additionally, since the limiting part of the computation is the factorization of the admittance matrix and this is done only once, its performance is competitive with established fast-decoupled loadflows.  The method is currently implemented into industrial-strength real-time and off-line packaged [[Energy management system|EMS]] applications.

== Background ==

The [[Power flow study|load-flow]] calculation is one of the most fundamental components in the analysis of power systems and is the
cornerstone for almost all other tools used in [[power system simulation]] and [[Energy management system|management]].  The load-flow equations can be written in the following general form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} V_k + Y_i^{\text{sh}} V_i = \frac{S_i^*}{V_i^*}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where the given (complex) parameters are the admittance matrix
{{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, the bus shunt admittances
{{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the bus power
injections {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} representing
constant-power loads and generators.

To solve this non-linear system of algebraic equations, traditional
load-flow algorithms were developed based on three iterative
techniques: the [[Gauss-Seidel]] method

properties, but it is computationally costly; and the Fast Decoupled

, which is based on Newton-Raphson, but greatly reduces its computational cost by means of a decoupling approximation that is valid in most transmission networks. Many other incremental improvements exist; however, the underlying technique in all of them is still an iterative solver, either of Gauss-Seidel or of Newton type. There are two fundamental problems with all iterative schemes of this type. On the one hand, there is no guarantee that the iteration will always converge to a solution; on the other, since the system has multiple solutions,&lt;ref group="note" name="multsol"&gt;It is well-known that the load flow equations for a power system have multiple solutions. For a network with {{math|&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;}} non-swing buses, the system may have up to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} possible solutions, but only one is actually possible in the real electrical system. This fact is used in stability studies, see for instance: Y. Tamura, H. Mori, and S. Iwamoto,"Relationship Between Voltage Instability and Multiple Load Flow Solutions in Electric Power Systems", '' IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems'', vol. PAS-102 , no.5, pp.1115-1125, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not possible to control which solution will be selected. As the power system approaches the point of voltage collapse, spurious solutions get closer to the correct one, and the iterative scheme may be easily attracted to one of them because of the phenomenon of Newton fractals: when the Newton method is applied to complex functions, the basins of attraction for the various solutions show fractal behavior.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is a general phenomenon affecting the Newton-Raphson method when applied to equations in
''complex'' variables. See for instance [[Newton's method#Complex functions]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, no matter how close the chosen initial point of the iterations (seed) is to the correct solution, there is always some non-zero chance of straying off to a different solution. These fundamental problems of iterative loadflows have been extensively documented.&lt;ref&gt;R. Klump and T.

&lt;/ref&gt;  A simple
illustration for the two-bus model is provided in&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elequant.com/products/agora/demo/iterativeloadflow/ Problems with Iterative Load Flow], Elequant, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there exist [[Homotopy|homotopic]] [[Numerical continuation|continuation]] techniques that alleviate the problem to some degree,&lt;ref&gt;V.

The key differential advantage of the HELM is that it is fully deterministic and unambiguous: it guarantees that the solution always
corresponds to the correct operative solution, when it exists; and it signals the non-existence of the solution when the conditions are such that there is no solution (voltage collapse). Additionally, the method is competitive with the FDNR method in terms of computational cost. It brings a solid mathematical treatment of the load-flow problem that provides new insights not previously available with the iterative numerical methods.

== Methodology and applications ==

HELM is grounded on a rigorous mathematical theory, and in practical terms it could be summarized as follows:
# Define a specific (holomorphic) embedding for the equations in terms of a complex parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}, such that for {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} the system has an obvious correct solution, and for {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} one recovers the original problem.
# Given this holomorphic embedding, it is now possible to compute univocally power series for voltages as analytic functions of {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}. The correct load-flow solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} will be obtained by analytic continuation of the known correct solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}.
# Perform the analytic continuation using algebraic approximants, which in this case are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist (voltage collapse).

HELM provides a solution to a long-standing problem of all iterative load-flow methods, namely the unreliability of the iterations in finding the correct solution (or any solution at all).

This makes HELM particularly suited for real-time applications, and mandatory for any EMS software based on exploratory algorithms, such as contingency analysis, and under alert and emergency conditions solving operational limits violations and restoration providing guidance through action plans.

== Holomorphic embedding ==

For the purposes of the discussion, we will omit the treatment of controls, but the method can accommodate all types of controls. For the constraint equations imposed by these controls, an appropriate holomorphic embedding must be also defined.

The method uses an embedding technique by means of a complex parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}.
The first key ingredient in the method lies in requiring the embedding to be holomorphic, that is, that the system of equations for voltages {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} is turned into a system of equations for functions {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} in such a way that the new system defines {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as holomorphic functions (i.e. complex analytic) of the new complex variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}. The aim is to be able to use the process of analytic continuation which will allow the calculation of {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}}. Looking at equations ({{EquationNote|1}}), a necessary condition for the embedding to be holomorphic is that {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} is replaced under the embedding with {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}}, not {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s)&lt;/var&gt;}}. This is because complex conjugation itself is not a holomorphic function. On the other hand, it is easy to see that the replacement {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(s&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}} does allow the equations to define a holomorphic function {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}}. However, for a given arbitrary embedding, it remains to be proven that {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} is indeed holomorphic. Taking into account all these considerations, an embedding of this type is proposed:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} V_k(s) + Y_i^{\text{sh}} V_i(s)  = s\frac{S_i^*}{V_i ^*(s^*)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

With this choice, at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} the right hand side terms become zero, (provided that the denominator is not zero), this corresponds to the case where all
the injections are zero and this case has a well known and simple operational solution: all voltages are equal and all flow intensities are zero. Therefore, this choice for the embedding provides at s=0 a well known operational solution.

Now using classical techniques for variable elimination in polynomial systems&lt;ref&gt;B. Sturmfels, "Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations”, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics 97, AMS, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; (results from the theory of [[Resultants]] and [[Gröbner basis#Elimination|Gröbner basis]] it can be proven that equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) do in fact define {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as holomorphic functions. More significantly, they define {{math|&lt;var&gt;V(s)&lt;/var&gt;}} as [[algebraic curves]]. It is this specific fact, which becomes true because the embedding is holomorphic that guarantees the uniqueness of the result. The solution at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} determines uniquely the solution everywhere (except on a finite number of branch cuts), thus getting rid of the multi-valuedness of the load-flow problem.

The technique to obtain the coefficients for the power series expansion (on {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}) of voltages {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} is quite straightforward, once one realizes that equations ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be used to obtain them order after order.  Consider the power series expansion for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V(s)=\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a[n] s^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1/V(s)=\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b[n] s^n&lt;/math&gt;. By substitution into equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) and identifying terms at each order in {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, one obtains:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_k Y_{ik} a_k[n] + Y_i^{\text{sh}} a_i[n]  = S_i^* b_i^*[n-1] \qquad (n=0, \ldots, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

It is then straightforward to solve the sequence of linear systems ({{EquationNote|2}}) successively order after order, starting from {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}}. Note that the coefficients of the expansions for {{math|&lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;1/V&lt;/var&gt;}} are related by the simple convolution formulas derived from the following identity:
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1 &amp; = V(s)V^{- 1} (s) \\
   &amp; = \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n s^n\right) \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n s^n\right) \\
   &amp; = a_0 b_0  + \left(\sum_{k=0}^1 a_{1-k} b_k\right) s + \left(\sum_{k=0}^2 a_{2-k} b_k\right) s^2  +  \cdots  + \left(\sum_{k = 0}^n a_{n-k} b_k\right) s^n  +  \ldots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
so that the right-hand side in ({{EquationNote|2}}) can always be calculated from the solution of the system at the previous order. Note also how the procedure works by solving just [[System of linear equations|linear systems]], in which the matrix remains constant.

A more detailed discussion about this procedure is offered in Ref.&lt;ref name="helmpaper" /&gt;

== Analytic continuation ==
Once the power series at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0}} are calculated to the desired order, the problem of calculating them at {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}1}} becomes one of [[analytic continuation]]. It should be strongly remarked that this does not have anything in common with the techniques of [[Homotopy#Applications|homotopic continuation]]. Homotopy is powerful since it only makes use of the concept of continuity and thus it is applicable to general smooth nonlinear systems, but on the other hand it does not always provide a reliable method to approximate the functions (as it relies on iterative schemes such as Newton-Raphson).

It can be proven&lt;ref&gt;L. Ahlfors, ''Complex analysis (3rd ed.)'', McGraw Hill, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; that algebraic curves are complete [[global analytic function]]s, that is, knowledge of the power series expansion at one point (the so-called germ of the function) uniquely determines the function everywhere on the complex plane, except on a finite number of [[Branch point#Branch cuts|branch cuts]]. Stahl’s extremal domain theorem&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, ''Padé Approximants'' (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; further asserts that there exists a maximal domain for the analytic continuation of the function, which corresponds to the choice of branch cuts with minimal [[Conformal radius#Version from infinity: transfinite diameter and logarithmic capacity|logarithmic capacity]] measure. In the case of algebraic curves the number of cuts is finite, therefore it would be feasible to find maximal continuations by finding the combination of cuts with minimal capacity. For further improvements, Stahl’s theorem on the convergence of Padé Approximants&lt;ref&gt;H. Stahl, “The Convergence of Padé Approximants to Functions with Branch Points”, ''J. Approx. Theory'', '''91''' (1997), 139-204.
* G. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, ''Padé Approximants'' (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the diagonal and supra-diagonal Padé (or equivalently, the continued fraction approximants to the power series) converge to the maximal analytic continuation. The zeros and poles of the approximants remarkably accumulate on the set of [[Branch point#Branch cuts|branch cuts]] having minimal capacity.

These properties confer the load-flow method with the ability to unequivocally detect the condition of voltage collapse: the algebraic approximations are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist.

[[File:Hot and high takeoff.png|thumb|440px]]

In [[aviation]], '''hot and high''' is a condition of low [[air density]] due to high [[ambient temperature]] and high airport [[elevation]]. Air density decreases with increasing temperature and altitude. The reduced density reduces the performance of the [[aircraft engine|aircraft's engine]]. Aviators gauge air density by calculating the [[density altitude]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/library/documents/2011/Aug/56396/FAA%20P-8740-02%20DensityAltitude[hi-res]%20branded.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hot" and "high" do not have to be mutually inclusive of one another, though this tends to be the exception. If an airport is especially hot ''or'' high, the other condition need not be present. Temperature and [[pressure altitude]] can change from one hour to the next. The fact that temperature decreases as altitude increases mitigates the "hot and high" effect to a small extent.

==Negative effects of reduced engine power due to hot and high conditions==
* Airplanes require a longer takeoff run, potentially exceeding the amount of available runway.
* Reduced take-off power hampers an aircraft's ability to climb. In some cases, an aircraft may be unable to climb rapidly enough to clear terrain surrounding a mountain airport.
* Helicopters may be forced to operate in the shaded portion of the [[height-velocity diagram]] in order to become airborne at all. This creates the potential for an uncontrollable descent in the event of an engine failure.
* In some cases, aircraft have landed at high-altitude airports by taking advantage of cold temperatures only to become stranded as temperatures warmed and air density decreased.
* While unsafe at any altitude, an overloaded aircraft is much more dangerous under hot and high conditions.

==Improving hot and high performance==
Some ways to increase aircraft performance in hot and high conditions include:
* Reduce aircraft weight. Weight can be reduced by carrying only enough fuel to reach the (lower-altitude) destination rather than filling the tanks completely. In some cases, unnecessary equipment can be removed from the aircraft. In many cases, however, the only practical way to adequately reduce aircraft weight is to depart with a smaller passenger, cargo, or weapons load. Consequently, hot and high conditions at the originating airport may prevent a commercial aircraft from operating with a load large enough to be profitable, or may constrain the firepower that a combat aircraft can bring to bear when conducting a long-range [[airstrike]].
* Increase engine power. More powerful engines can improve an airplane's acceleration and reduce its takeoff run. More powerful engines are generally larger and heavier and use more fuel during cruise, however, increasing the fuel load needed to reach the same destination. The added weight of the fuel and engines may negate the potential performance gain, and the added cost of the extra fuel may constrain the profitability of a commercial aircraft. On the other hand, replacing an older, less efficient engine with a newer engine of more advanced design can increase both power output and efficiency while sometimes even decreasing weight. In this situation, the only real disadvantage is the cost of the upgrade.
* Utilize [[assisted take off]] devices, such as [[RATO|rockets]], to increase lift and acceleration.
* Inject [[distilled water]] during takeoff in the engine (compressor or combustor). The primary purpose of water injection into jet engines is to increase the mass being accelerated, thereby increasing the force created by the engine. A secondary purpose is to cool the engine so that higher power settings may be used without causing an engine overheat.

==Jet or rocket assisted take off==
{{Main|JATO}}
Auxiliary rockets and/or [[jet engines]] can help a fully loaded aircraft to take off within the length of the runway. The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff. This practice was common in the 1950s and 60s, when the lower levels of thrust from military [[turbojets]] was inadequate for takeoff from shorter runways or with very heavy payloads. It is now seldom used.

Auxiliary jets and rockets have rarely been used on civil aircraft due to the risk of aircraft damage and loss of control if something were to go wrong during their use. Boeing did, however, produce a version of its popular [[Boeing 727]] with JATO primarily for "hot and high" operations out of Mexico City Airport ([[Mexico City International Airport|MMMX]]) and La Paz, Bolivia. The boosters were located adjacent to the main landing gear at the wing root on each side of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tailsthroughtime.com/2010/04/ive-always-had-soft-spot-for-boeing-727.html|title=The Boeing 727 JATO Option|website=www.tailsthroughtime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized aircraft==
Several manufacturers of early [[jet airliner]]s offered variants optimized for hot and high operations. Such aircraft generally offered the largest wings and/or the most powerful engines in the model lineup coupled with a small [[fuselage]] to reduce weight. Some such aircraft include:

* The [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC One-Eleven 475]] combined the short body of the series 400 with the more powerful engines and improved wings of the series 500.  This aircraft also featured stronger landing gear for rough field operations.
* The [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707–220]], which was a 707–120 airframe fitted with more powerful [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A]] engines, civilian versions of the military J75. The 707-220 had extremely high fuel consumption, and only 5 were built, all for [[Braniff International Airways]]. The 707-220 was rendered redundant by the release of the [[turbofan]]-powered 707-120B, which had even greater power along with much lower fuel consumption.
*The [[Convair 880]]. Although Convair only offered one configuration of this aircraft, it had more power and a smaller fuselage than its competitors from Boeing and Douglas. Convair essentially wagered the success of the entire 880 model line on the appeal of an aircraft optimized for hot and high operations. The wager failed; only sixty-five 880s were sold and Convair's nascent airliner business soon collapsed.
*The [[Bombardier Dash 8|De Havilland Canada Dash 8-200]], which is a -100 airframe fitted with larger engines of the -300 for hot and high operations. They proved successful and are still a current option from Bombardier, having replaced the -100 production line. 
* The [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011-200]], which was otherwise an L-1011-100 with more powerful RB.211-524B engines.
* The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|McDonnell Douglas DC-9-20]], which combined the smaller fuselage of the DC-9-10 with the larger wings and more powerful engines of the DC-9-30, and was significantly outsold by both.
* The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15]], which combined the fuselage of the DC-10-10 with the larger engines of the DC-10-30. These were specifically designed for and sold to [[Aeromexico]] and [[Mexicana de Aviación|Mexicana]]. Only seven were built.
* The [[Vickers VC10]], which was designed to meet [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] requirements for a large airliner that could operate medium range flights from short runways in southern Asia and Africa. The rear-mounted engines gave a more efficient wing and made them less vulnerable to runway debris. The resulting high fuel consumption compared to the contemporary Boeing 707 prompted all other major airlines to dismiss the VC10. 
* The [[McDonnell Douglas MD-82]] was a hot and high version of the MD-80, and sold well, which was odd among hot and high aircraft

The marketing failure of these airplanes demonstrated that [[airline]]s were generally unwilling to accept reduced efficiency at cruise and smaller ultimate load-carrying capacity in return for a slight performance gain at particular airports. Rather than accepting these drawbacks, it was easier for airlines to demand the construction of longer runways, operate with smaller loads as conditions dictated, or simply drop the unprofitable destinations.

Furthermore, as the second generation of jet airliners began to appear in the 1970s, some aircraft were designed to eliminate the need for a special "hot and high" variant – for instance, the [[Airbus A300]] can perform a 15/0 takeoff, where the leading edge slats are adjusted to 15 degrees and the flaps kept retracted. This takeoff technique is only used at hot and high airports, for it enables a higher climb limit weight and improves second segment climb performance.

Most jetliner manufacturers have dropped the "hot and high" variants from their model lineups.

==Other uses==
Less formally, ''hot and high'' can also describe a botched [[final approach (aviation)|landing approach]], where a fixed-wing [[aircraft]] is too fast (''hot'') and too high above the [[glidepath]]: since the only way to slow the rate of descent is to increase speed, and the aircraft is already too fast, it is unlikely that the approach can be successfully carried to a safe landing.

'''Indian calligraphy''' is the [[Culture of India|Indian]] tradition of [[calligraphy]], or artistic writing. The art form has served multiple purposes since its inception in the second century BCE, including the duplication of religious texts and as a form of basic communication.

== History ==
===Early calligraphy (2nd century BCE-6th century CE)===
Beginning in the 2nd century AD, Indic language was transferred using [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark]] as a writing surface. Locally, the birch bark was called Bhojpatra in [[India]] - patra meaning leaf/bark/sheet in [[Sanskrit]]. Palm leaves were used as a substitute to paper, even after paper was available for Indic manuscripts. The leaves were commonly used because they were a good surface for pen writing, which created the delicate and decorative handwriting that is known as calligraphy today. Both sides of these leaves were used and they were stacked on top of each other. People then created holes on the leaves and held them together by string, thus creating the early Indian manuscripts, common in Southeast Asia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indic Calligraphy|last=Anderson|first=D.M.|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages (6th century-16th century)===
Indian calligraphy took off starting around 500 AD when Indian traders, colonists, military adventurers, [[Bhikku|Buddhist monks]] and missionaries brought the [[Indic script]] to Central Asia from [[South East Asia]]. Different concepts and ideas were being created throughout the late 400s to late 1400s, in a 1000-year span. The [[Gilgit]] scripts are the earliest notable form of calligraphy in India that date back to the 5th and 6th centuries. The earliest painted covers of manuscripts were created between the 7th and 9th centuries, and the earliest illustrated manuscript in South Asia was not formed until around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East|last=Stevens|first=John|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0877734585|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Qutb Minar Minaret Delhi India.jpg|160px|thumb|Inscriptions in the [[Kufic]] style of [[calligraphy]] form regular bands throughout the [[Qutb Minar]], [[Delhi]], built 1192 CE]]

The languages of South East Asia were influenced by Indic language and culture. The languages that were created came in the form of the basic internal structure, the arrangement and construction of syllabic units, manner of representation of characters, and the direction of writing (left to right). Before this left to right reading, the technique of [[Palm-leaf manuscript|Pothi]] was utilized, which is the format of a book that is written vertically. This was useful for the illustrations made in these early manuscripts. [[Persian people|Persian]] influence in Indian calligraphy gave rise to a unique and influential blend in Indian calligraphy, although a number of different calligraphic traditions existed in India already, and Indic scripts were fundamentally different from scripts used in Arabic and Persian traditions. The notable achievements of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]] included some of their fine manuscripts, which were usually autobiographies and chronicles of the noble class. They were initially written in flowing [[Persian language|Persian]] script, which was one of the main forms of communication during this time, and which showed a multi-directionality and mutuality of influence on Indic calligraphers.

From the 16th century onwards [[Sikhism]] played a key role in the history of Indian calligraphy. Sikhs have traditionally handwritten their holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and furnished it with illumination. [[Sikh]] calligrapher [[Pratap Singh Giani]] (1855–1920) is known for one of the first definitive translations of Sikh scriptures into [[English language|English]].[[Image:Asokan brahmi pillar edict.jpg|thumb|right|184x184px|A fragment of [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka's 6th pillar edict]].]]

=== Modern Period (16th century-today) ===
There was a bigger goal to this style of language than just to communicate with one another. There was no one true form of [[communication]] before this was created, and calligraphy helped to guide community members to connect in more than one aspect of life, that was not just language. A rich heritage of calligraphy was embraced as this was a time before [[printing]] technology was accessible to Indian counties. This brought people closer together as they began to communicate in the same ways. While it may be used as an art form today, it was essential for communication before the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Features of Indian calligraphy ==
[[Religious text]]s are the most frequent vehicle for calligraphy in India. [[Monastic]] Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0195099843|location=Oxford, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism|Jaina]] traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13800">[[File:19K1 IF stages.jpg|thumb|The IF stage from a Motorola 19K1 television set ''circa'' 1949.]]
In communications and [[electronic engineering]], an '''intermediate frequency''' ('''IF''') is a [[frequency]] to which a [[carrier wave]] is shifted as an intermediate step in [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or reception.&lt;ref name=Smith46/&gt; The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a [[local oscillator]] signal in a process called [[heterodyning]], resulting in a signal at the difference or [[beat frequency]].   Intermediate frequencies are used in [[Superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] [[radio receiver]]s, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for [[Amplifier|amplification]] before final [[Detector (radio)|detection]] is done.

Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons. When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune. Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required.  It's easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.

There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called  ''double'' (alternatively, ''dual'') or ''triple'' ''conversion'', respectively.

==Reasons for using IF==
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons.&lt;ref name="ArmyManual"&gt;{{cite book

 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very high ([[gigahertz]]) frequencies, signal processing circuitry performs poorly. Active devices such as [[transistor]]s cannot deliver much amplification ([[Gain (electronics)|gain]]).&lt;ref name="Smith46"&gt;F. Langford Smith (ed) ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'', 3rd Edition (Wireless Press 1946) Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1946 ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' observes on page 159 that some short-wave receivers operate with an IF of 1600 kHz and that "At such a high frequency one or two additional IF stages are required are necessary to provide sufficient gain."&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinary circuits using [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as [[stripline]]s and [[waveguide]]s. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing.  For example, in [[satellite dish]]es, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive [[coaxial cable]] to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building.  Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]].

A second reason, in receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage [[amplifier]]s, [[Electronic filter|filters]], and [[detector (radio)|detector]]s that can have all stages track in tuning different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable [[Electronic oscillator|oscillators]]. Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF.   Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency  was changed, as was necessary in the early [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s.   A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range.  The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency.  In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies its bandwidth increases.

The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Smith46" /&gt; In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out or extract signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency. This is called [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]]. Some examples are, picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the [[chrominance]] subcarrier from a TV signal. With all known filtering techniques the filter's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] increases proportionately with the  frequency. So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[television broadcasting]] with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as [[cell phone]]s and [[cable television]], would be impossible without using frequency conversion.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;{{cite book

==Uses==
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455&amp;nbsp;kHz for AM receivers and 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz for FM receivers. In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used. A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity. A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.&lt;ref name=ARRL77&gt;Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),''Solid state design for the radio amateur'', (American Radio Relay League, 1977) pp. 82-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In a digital receiver, the analog to digital converter ([[analog to digital converter|ADC]]) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency.   However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.

Modern [[satellite television]] receivers use several intermediate frequencies.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom"&gt;{{cite book

The downlink signal is received by a [[satellite dish]].  In the box at the focus of the dish, called a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950 - 2150&amp;nbsp;MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6&amp;nbsp;GHz.  One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators.   This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable.  At the cable company's [[set top box]], the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480&amp;nbsp;MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom" /&gt;  This is sent through a 30&amp;nbsp;MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the [[transponder]]s on the satellite, which carries several channels.  Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.

==History==

An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1918, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A member of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], Armstrong was building radio [[direction finding]] equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, however, it was easy to get them to [[Electronic oscillator|oscillate]] above that frequency.   Armstrong's solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal, and mix it with the incoming signal in a 'mixer' tube, creating a 'heterodyne' or signal at the lower difference frequency, where it could be amplified easily. For example, to pick up a signal at 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz. Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes.

After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], who subsequently sold it to [[RCA]]. The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier [[Regenerative receiver|regenerative]] or [[tuned radio frequency receiver]] designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were 'superhets'. During the development of [[radar]] in [[World War II]], the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies. Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

==Commonly used intermediate frequencies==
* 110&amp;nbsp;kHz was used in [[Long wave]] broadcast receivers.&lt;ref name="Smith46"/&gt;{{rp|159}}
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system M: 41.25&amp;nbsp;MHz (audio) and 45.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (video). Note, the channel is flipped over in the conversion process in an [[intercarrier method|intercarrier]] system, so the audio IF frequency is lower than the video IF frequency. Also, there is no audio local oscillator, the injected video carrier serves that purpose.
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system B and similar systems: 33.4&amp;nbsp;MHz. for aural and 38.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. for visual signal. (The discussion about the frequency conversion is the same as in system M).
*[[FM radio]] receivers: 262&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, 75&amp;nbsp;MHz and 98&amp;nbsp;MHz. In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz is often used, followed by a second intermediate frequency of 470&amp;nbsp;kHz. There are triple conversion designs used in police scanner receivers, high-end communications receivers, and many point-to-point microwave systems. Modern DSP chip consumer radios often use a 'low-IF' of 128kHz for FM.
*[[AM radio]] receivers: 450&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 460&amp;nbsp;kHz, 465&amp;nbsp;kHz, 467&amp;nbsp;kHz, 470&amp;nbsp;kHz, 475&amp;nbsp;kHz, 480&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Ravalico D. E., ''Radioelementi'', Milan, Hoepli, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Satellite [[uplink]]-[[downlink]] equipment: 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, 950–1450&amp;nbsp;MHz (L-band) downlink first IF.
*Terrestrial [[microwave]] equipment: 250&amp;nbsp;MHz, 70&amp;nbsp;MHz or 75&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radar]]: 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radio frequency|RF]] Test Equipment: 310.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 160&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The '''John H. Chapman Space Centre''' is the [[headquarters]] of the [[Canadian Space Agency]]. It is located in [[Longueuil]], [[Quebec]], Canada, in the borough of [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]].

==Location and name==

The centre has a total surface area of 41 hectares (101 acres)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/dfrp-rbif/pn-nb/11818-eng.aspx John H. Chapman Space Center].  Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. Retrieved on April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; located on the border of the [[Montréal/St-Hubert Airport|Saint Hubert airport]], a [[general aviation]] facility. The building is supposed to look somewhat like a [[space station]]. When seen from above however, it bears no resemblance to real stations like the [[International Space Station|ISS]] or to famous fictional ones.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Space Agency headquarters photo.  ''[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/674/1 Can we finally reach for the stars?]'', "The Space Review".  Retrieved on 2008-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was finished in 1992 and named Canadian Space Agency Headquarters, and in 1996, it was renamed the John H. Chapman Space Centre in honour of [[John H. Chapman|John Chapman]] for his accomplishments in the [[Canadian Space Program]] and because of his role in the [[Alouette 1]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=135 John Herbert Chapman - Builder of the Canadian space program]. ''Science Canada''. Retrieved on April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

The centre houses the Canadian [[astronaut]] office and most of the administrative and technical units supporting Canada's programs in space sciences and technology. This includes satellite control rooms, the Protein Crystal Growth Mission Support Centre, and simulators for the [[Canadarm2]], the [[Mobile Servicing System]], and the [[Advanced Space Vision System]].  It also houses the Mission Operations Centre (MOC) that includes the Remote Multi-Purpose Support Room (RMPSR) that is used to operate the [[Mobile Servicing System|MSS]] on-orbit in conjunction with the flight control and mission evaluation rooms at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] as well as the Operations and Engineering Centre (OEC) which supports the flight controllers at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|JSC]]. As the headquarters for the space agency, it also houses many offices for general administrative functions or for specific programs such as exchange activities with [[NASA]], [[ESA]], [[ISRO]] and other [[national space agencies]].

'''Lammas growth''', also called '''Lammas leaves''', '''Lammas flush''', '''second shoots''', or '''summer shoots''', is a season of renewed growth in some  trees in [[temperate]] regions put on in July and August (if in the northern hemisphere, January and February if in the southern), that is around [[Lammas]] day, August 1, which is the Celtic harvest festival. 

It can occur in both hardwoods and softwoods. Examples of common trees which exhibit regrowth are [[oak]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[sycamore]], [[taxus|yew]], [[scots pine]], [[sitka spruce]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]. This secondary growth may be an evolutionary strategy to compensate for leaf damage caused by insects during the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3352018/Late-summer-growth.html|title=Late summer growth|last=Guinness |first=Bunny |date=16 Aug 2006|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not present in [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]] or [[willow]].

Lammas growth declines with the age of the tree, being most vigorous and noticeable in young trees. It  differs in nature from spring growth which is fixed when leaves and shoots are laid down in the bud the previous year. The lammas flush is free growth of newly made leaves/needles throughout the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Battey|first=Nicholas H. |year=2003|title=August – learning about summer |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=  54|issue=  389|pages=1798|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/54/389/1797.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of the buds set in the Spring on the ends of terminal and lateral stems will break, and begin to grow, producing a new shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West |first=Richard F. |author2=Rogers, Robert  |year=1965|title=THE EFFECT OF LAMMAS SHOOT GROWTH ON THE STEM FORM OF YOUNG SCOTCH PINE|journal=Published as a Paper of the Journal Series, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station|url=http://www.rngr.net/Publications/neftic/17th-northeastern-forest-tree-improvement-conference-1971/the-effect-of-lammas-shoot-growth-on-the-stem-form-of-young-scotch-pine/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">==Physical limits==
There are several physical and practical limits to the amount of [[computation]] or [[data storage device|data storage]] that can be performed with a given amount of mass, volume, or energy:

* The [[Bekenstein bound]] limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.
* Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice it is a stronger bound than Bekenstein bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandberg|first=Anders|title=The Physics of Information Processing Superobjects: Daily Life Among the Jupiter Brains|date=22 December 1999|url=http://transhumanist.com/volume5/Brains2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Landauer's principle]] defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: {{math|''[[Boltzmann constant|k]]T'' ln 2}} [[joule]]s consumed per irreversible state change, where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the operating temperature of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The physics of forgetting: Landauer's erasure principle and information theory|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00107510010018916|pages=25–60|issn=0010-7514|eissn=1366-5812|last=Vitelli|first=M.B.|last2=Plenio|first2=V.|date=2001|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/55905.PDF|arxiv=quant-ph/0103108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reversible computing]] is not subject to this lower bound.  ''T'' cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 [[kelvins]], the approximate temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation.
* [[Bremermann's limit]] is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.
* The [[Margolus–Levitin theorem]] sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second per [[joule]]. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amount of energy/time per one elementary computation step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Stephen P.|title=Fast quantum computation at arbitrarily low energy|journal = Phys. Rev. A | volume = 95 | pages=032305 | year=2017 |arxiv = 1701.01175|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01175.pdf | doi=10.1103/physreva.95.032305|bibcode=2017PhRvA..95c2305J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinitsyn|first=Nikolai A.|title=Is there a quantum limit on speed of computation?|year=2017|arxiv = 1701.05550|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05550.pdf|bibcode=2018PhLA..382..477S|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building devices that approach physical limits==
Several methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits:
* A cold [[degenerate star]] could conceivably be used as a giant data storage device, by carefully perturbing it to various excited states, in the same manner as an atom or [[quantum well]] used for these purposes. Such a star would have to be artificially constructed, as no natural degenerate stars will cool to this temperature for an extremely long time. It is also possible that [[nucleon]]s on the surface of [[neutron star]]s could form complex "molecules",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title=Life on neutron stars |encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |publisher= |location= |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/neutronstarlife.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; which some have suggested might be used for computing purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/essays/femtotech.html |title=Femtotech? (Sub)Nuclear Scale Engineering and Computation |accessdate=2006-10-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025030505/http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/essays/femtotech.html |archivedate=October 25, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a type of [[computronium]] based on [[femtotechnology]], which would be faster and denser than computronium based on [[nanotechnology]].
* It may be possible to use a [[black hole]] as a data storage or computing device, if a practical mechanism for extraction of contained information can be found. Such extraction may in principle be possible ([[Stephen Hawking]]'s proposed resolution to the [[black hole information paradox]]). This would achieve storage density exactly equal to the [[Bekenstein bound]]. [[Seth Lloyd]] calculated&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9908043.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the computational abilities of an "ultimate laptop" formed by compressing a kilogram of matter into a black hole of radius 1.485 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; meters, concluding that it would only last about 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; seconds before [[Hawking radiation#Black hole evaporation|evaporating]] due to [[Hawking radiation]], but that during this brief time it could compute at a rate of about 5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second, ultimately performing about 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; operations on 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; bits (~1 [[petabyte|PB]]). Lloyd notes that "Interestingly, although this hypothetical computation is performed at ultra-high densities and speeds, the total number of bits available to be processed is not far from the number available to current computers operating in more familiar surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd |first=Seth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month= |title=Ultimate physical limits to computation |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=406 |issue=6799 |pages=1047–1054 |doi=10.1038/35023282 |url=http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/QM/lloyd_nature_406_1047_00.pdf |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10984064 |arxiv=quant-ph/9908043 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173904/http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/QM/lloyd_nature_406_1047_00.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'', Ray Kurzweil cites the calculations of Seth Lloyd that a universal-scale computer is capable of 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second. The mass of the universe can be estimated at 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms. If all matter in the universe was turned into a black hole it would have a lifetime of 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;139&lt;/sup&gt; seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation. During that lifetime such a universal-scale black hole computer would perform 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt; operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=New York: Viking|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is expected that a black hole computer cannot find exact solutions to all [[NP-completeness|NP-Complete]] problems in polynomial time since they scale as &lt;math&gt;O({2^N})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O({N!})&lt;/math&gt;. Searching for an exact solution to a [[Travelling salesman problem|Traveling Salesman Problem]] with an instance of 3000 locations would take both the standard [[Grover's algorithm]] with &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps and [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian]] [[Grover's algorithm]] with &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt[3]{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps more than 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt; operations.

==Abstract limits in computer science==
In the field of theoretical [[computer science]] the [[Computability Theory|computability]] and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computational problems are often sought-after.  Computability theory describes the degree to which problems are computable; whereas complexity theory describes the asymptotic degree of resource consumption.  Computational problems are therefore confined into [[complexity classes]].  The [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[polynomial hierarchy]] classify the degree to which problems are respectively computable and computable in polynomial time.  For instance, the level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy classifies computable, partial functions.  Moreover, this hierarchy is strict such that at any other class in the arithmetic hierarchy classifies strictly [[Uncomputable function|uncomputable]] functions.

==Loose and tight limits==
Many limits derived in terms of physical constants and abstract models of computation in Computer Science are loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markov |first=Igor |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2014 |month= |title=Limits on Fundamental Limits to Computation|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=512 |issue= |pages=147–154|doi=10.1038/nature13570 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=1408.3821 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..147M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few known limits directly obstruct leading-edge technologies, but many engineering obstacles currently cannot be explained by closed-form limits.

In [[astronomy]], '''long-slit spectroscopy''' involves observing an elongated [[Astronomical object|celestial object]] (such as a nebula or along the [[major axis]] of a [[disc galaxy]] at high [[inclination]]) through an elongated slit aperture, and [[refraction|refracting]] this light with a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] or [[diffraction grating]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spectrograph causes the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler shift]]-induced frequency distribution of the collected light to manifest as a spatial distribution through differential refraction, revealing the amplitude of the rotation curve.

==Velocity profiles==
[[File:Nebula velocity profiles.jpg|thumb|300px|Typical velocity profiles of several nebulae observed using long-slit spectroscopy.]]
This technique can be used to observe the [[rotation curve]] of a galaxy, as those stars moving towards the observer are [[blueshift|blue-shifted]], while stars moving away are [[redshift|red-shifted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Long-slit spectroscopy can also be used to observe the expansion of [[optical depth|optically-thin]] nebulae. When the spectrographic slit extends over the diameter of a nebula, the lines of the velocity profile meet at the edges. In the middle of the nebula, the line splits in two, since one component is redshifted and one is blueshifted. The blueshifted component will appear brighter as it is on the "near side" of the nebula, and is as such subject to a smaller degree of [[attenuation]] as the light coming from the far side of the nebula. The tapered edges of the velocity profile stem from the fact that the material at the edge of the nebula is moving perpendicular to the line of sight and so its line of sight velocity will be zero relative to the rest of the nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Several effects can contribute to the transverse broadening of the velocity profile. Individual stars themselves rotate as they orbit, so the side approaching will be blueshifted and the side moving away will be redshifted. Stars also have random (as well as [[orbit]]al) motion around the galaxy, meaning any individual star may depart significantly from the rest relative to its neighbours in the rotation curve. In [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] this random motion is small compared to the [[Orbital eccentricity|low-eccentricity]] orbital motion, but this is not true for an [[elliptical galaxy]]. Molecular-scale [[Doppler broadening]] will also contribute.

==Advantages==
Long-slit spectroscopy can ameliorate problems with [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] when observing structures near a very [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminous]] source. The structure in question can be observed through a slit, thus [[Occultation|occulting]] the luminous source and allowing a greater [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. An example of this application would be the observation of the [[kinematics]] of [[Herbig–Haro object|Herbig-Haro objects]] around their parent star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Lucretia Johanna van Winter''' (1785 – 1845) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art collector.

Winter was born in [[Amsterdam]] as the oldest child of the wealthy merchant Pieter van Winter who received visitors to his art gallery that he had installed at the rear of his house ''Saxenburg'', [[Keizersgracht]] 244. He had purchased the house for the astronomical sum of Dfl. 100,000 from [[Jean de Neufville]]. In 1800 her mother died and in 1807 her father died, leaving the collection as it then was in the family home, the portraits of which became the property of Lucretia's brother. The rest of the paintings were to be divided between Lucretia and her younger sister [[Annewies van Winter|Anna Louisa]], who would later amass her own art collection.

After her brother's marriage Lucretia bought the house [[Herengracht]] 440 in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/WinterLucretia Lucretia Johanna van Winter] in [[1001 Vrouwen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's art gallery remained available for viewing at her parent's home (now her brother's residence) and were to be split after the youngest sister Anna Louisa came of age. Anna Louisa took her portion of the collection when she married jonkheer Willem van Loon in 1815, but Lucretia had already made her first art purchases since 1810 with a view to forming her own art gallery and united her half of her father's collection with this modest collection of her own. She continued collecting in her own name until 1820, purchasing in total 71 paintings on her own. In 1822 at the age of 37 Lucretia married Hendrik Six van Hillegom (1790-1847) and the couple moved into his house at Herengracht 509-511. After that all art purchases were made in his name, but it is assumed that she remained an avid collector since there are no records of him making art purchases before his marriage. 

Among the most notable of the paintings Lucretia bought herself are Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|Milkmaid]]'' and ''[[The Little Street]]''. After the death of Lucretia the collection went to her husband and on his death in 1847 it fell to their sons. In 1877 the heirs of Anna Louisa sold the Van Loon-Winter collection as a block to the Paris Rothschild family, which caused a stir in the Dutch papers (it included the ''[[Pendant portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit]]'', among others). When Lucretia's children died her grandchildren also expected to sell the collection, but a large portion was acquired by the Rijksmuseum amidst debates about the value. They accepted an offer from the heirs for Vermeer's milkmaid plus 38 other paintings for Dfl. 750.000.

The '''M.E.M. (Master of Environmental Management)''' is a degree designed for students with primary interests in careers in [[environmental policy]] and [[analysis]], [[stewardship]], [[education]], [[Consultant|consulting]], or [[management]] dealing with [[natural resource]] or [[Environmental quality|environmental]] issues. The program requires course work in both the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, with a particular focus on the relationship among [[science]], management, and [[policy]]. The ultimate purpose of the [[degree program]] is to prepare students to address ecological and social systems with scientific understanding and an ability to make sense of the complex underlying social and ecological context.

The value of an interdisciplinary environmental degree is best espoused by [[Aldo Leopold]], who obtained a [[Master of Forestry]] degree.

''"One of the requisites for an ecological comprehension of land is an understanding of ecology, and this is by no means co-extensive with 'education'; in fact, much higher education seems deliberately to avoid ecological concepts. An understanding of ecology does not necessarily originate in courses bearing ecological labels; it is quite as likely to be labeled geography, botany, agronomy, history, or economics. This is as it should be...".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There|year=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, a '''notehead''' is the elliptical part of a [[Musical note|note]]. Noteheads may be the same shape but colored completely black or white, indicating the [[note value]] (i.e., rhythmic duration). In a [[whole note]], the notehead, shaped differently than shorter notes, is the only component of the note. Shorter note values attach a [[stem (music)|stem]] to the notehead, and possibly [[beam (music)|beam]]s or flags. The longer [[double whole note]] can be written with vertical lines surrounding it, two attached noteheads, or a rectangular notehead.&lt;ref name="Gerou"&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda: [https://books.google.es/books?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA210 ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation''.] Alfred Music, 1996, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; An "x" shaped notehead may be used to indicate percussion, percussive effects ([[ghost note]]s), or speaking. A square, diamond, or box shaped notehead may be used to indicate a [[harmonic|natural]] or [[artificial harmonic]].

==History==
Noteheads ultimately derive from the [[neume]]s used to notate [[Gregorian chant]]. The punctum, seen at right, is the simplest of the shapes and most clearly anticipates the modern notehead. When placed on a [[clef]], the position of a notehead indicates the relative pitch of a note. The development of different colors of noteheads, and the use of it to indicate rhythmic values, was the use of white [[mensural notation]], adopted around 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Busse Berger|first=Anna Maria|title=Mensuration and Proportion Signs: Origins and Evolution|location=Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franco of Cologne]], ancient composer and music theorist, codified a system of rhythm notation. He explained this system in his work, ''Ars Cantus Mensurabilis'', (which means “The Art of Measurable Music”) circa 1280. In this system, the relative duration of notes was indicated by the note shapes. The noteheads were rectangles, squares, or diamonds depending on the note length. This system was expanded during the [[Ars Nova]] period.

Shortly before the [[Renaissance]], scribes began to write the notes of the Franconian and Ars Nova style with open noteheads. During the Renaissance, composers added shorter note durations that used filled-in noteheads. Near the end of the 16th century, the square or diamond-shaped notes changed to the round noteheads that are used today.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, J.P., Grout, D.J., &amp; Palisca, C.V. (2006).

'''The oldest profession in the world''' (or '''the world's oldest profession''') is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to [[prostitution]].  However, it did not acquire that meaning universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.

==Earlier sense==
The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,&lt;ref&gt;"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; [[droving|cattle drovers]],&lt;ref&gt;"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[horticulture|horticulturalists]],&lt;ref&gt;"… certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; engineers,&lt;ref&gt;"… we belong to the oldest profession in the world" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167).&lt;/ref&gt; [[landscape gardener]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.)&lt;/ref&gt; the military,&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; doctors,&lt;ref&gt;''The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine'', 1875, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nurses]],&lt;ref&gt;''Nursing World'', vols 21–22, 1898, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ohio Educational Monthly'', vol 57, 1908, p.294.&lt;/ref&gt; [[priests]],&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; and even lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer"  (Alfred Butler, ''Elphinstone'', vol 1, 1841, p.189).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of [[tailors]].  The ''Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors'', attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at [[procession|pageants]] at the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], [[London]], if the current mayor happened to belong to the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|
tailors' guild]],&lt;ref&gt;Percy Society, ''Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'', vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Of all the professions that ever were nam'd,
The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd':
For various invention, and antiquity,
No trade with the tayler's comparèd may be:
&lt;/poem&gt;
After pointing out that [[Adam and Eve]] made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade.
The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,&lt;ref&gt;Bitter deriders or scoffers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Acquisition of opprobrious sense==
The phrase began to acquire its opprobrious sense in the last decade of the nineteenth century following [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story about an Indian prostitute, ''On the City Wall'' (January 1889).  Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua ii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. [[Lilith]] was her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one knows.  In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that Morality may be preserved.  In the East where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East to manage its own affairs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation ''Reynold's Newspaper'', 22 July 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the reference was repeated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of ladies.  The ladies belonged to what has been called “the oldest profession in the world", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent street, and other parts of London with great energy every night …&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In the same year the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;12 November 1894, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; reported a speech in which "Mrs. Ormiston Chant … implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'".

The phrase was frequently used as a [[euphemism]] when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution.

Kipling was not the first to employ the phrase "the most ancient profession" in an opprobrious sense.  The Irish poet [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] (1701–1783) wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper'', vol 17, p.428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Of all trades and arts in repute or possession,
[[Humbug]]ging is held the most ancient profession.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The phrase had also been applied to murderers.  In  ''The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries'' (1875),&lt;ref&gt;(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles William Heckethorn, describing the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] of India, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[hierophant]], on initiating the candidate, says to him: "Thou hast chosen, my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity.  Thou hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense==
There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning.  Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: “A certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world” (1895).&lt;ref&gt;(The profession of arms.)  Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, ''Morning Post'', 21 December 1895, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; “This gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'" (1902).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener.)  ''Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate &amp; Cheriton Herald'', 17 May 1902, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Mr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us.  His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm.  As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world” (1915).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener).  ''Stirling Observer'', 12 November 1915, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable.

[[Image:Theb1982.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a man taking measurements with a theodolite in a frozen environment.|[[Gustav Elfving]] developed the optimal design of experiments, and so minimized surveyors' need for  [[theodolite|theodolite measurements]] ''(pictured)'', while trapped in his tent in storm-ridden [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="Nord76"&gt;{{harvtxt|Nordström|1999|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the [[design of experiments]], '''optimal designs''' (or '''optimum designs'''&lt;ref&gt;The adjective "optimum" (and not "optimal") "is the slightly older form in English and avoids the construction 'optim(um) + al´—there is no 'optimalis' in Latin" (page x in ''Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS'', by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias).&lt;/ref&gt;) are a class of [[design of experiments|experimental designs]] that are [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] with respect to some [[statistical theory|statistical]] [[objective function|criterion]]. The creation of this field of statistics has been credited to Danish statistician [[Kirstine Smith]].&lt;ref name=GL2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guttorp |first=P. |last2=Lindgren |first2=G. |title= Karl Pearson and the Scandinavian school of statistics |journal= International Statistical Review |volume=77 |year=2009 |page=64 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KS1918&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Kirstine |title=On the standard deviations of adjusted and interpolated values of an observed polynomial function and its constants and the guidance they give towards a proper choice of the distribution of observations |journal=Biometrika |volume=12 |year=1918 |page=1 |doi=10.2307/2331929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[design of experiments]] for [[estimation theory|estimating]] [[statistical model]]s, '''optimal designs''' allow parameters to be [[bias of an estimator|estimated without bias]] and with [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|minimum variance]]. A non-optimal design requires a greater number of [[replication (statistics)|experimental runs]] to [[estimation theory|estimate]] the [[parametric model|parameters]] with the same [[efficiency (statistics)|precision]] as an optimal design. In practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce the costs of experimentation.

The optimality of a design depends on the [[statistical model]] and is assessed with respect to a statistical criterion, which is related to the variance-matrix of the estimator. Specifying an appropriate model and specifying a suitable criterion function both require understanding of [[statistical theory]] and practical knowledge with [[design of experiments|designing experiments]].

==Advantages==

Optimal designs offer three advantages over suboptimal [[Design of experiments|experimental designs]]:&lt;ref&gt;These three advantages (of optimal designs) are documented in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Optimal designs reduce the costs of experimentation by allowing [[statistical model]]s to be estimated with fewer experimental runs.
#Optimal designs can accommodate multiple types of factors, such as process, mixture, and discrete factors.
#Designs can be optimized when the design-space is constrained, for example, when the mathematical process-space contains factor-settings that are practically infeasible (e.g. due to safety concerns).

==Minimizing the variance of estimators==
Experimental designs are evaluated using statistical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Such criteria are called [[objective function]]s in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that the [[least squares]] estimator minimizes the [[variance]] of [[Expected value|mean]]-[[Bias of an estimator|unbiased]] [[estimators]] (under the conditions of the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]). In the [[estimation]] theory for [[statistical model]]s with one [[real number|real]] [[parameter]], the [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the variance of an ([[statistical efficiency|"efficient"]]) estimator is called the "[[Fisher information]]" for that estimator.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Fisher information]] and other "[[entropy (information theory)|information]]" [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s are fundamental concepts in [[statistical theory]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this reciprocity, '''''minimizing'' the ''variance''''' corresponds to '''''maximizing'' the ''information'''''.

When the [[statistical model]] has several [[parameter]]s, however, the [[Expected value|mean]] of the parameter-estimator is a [[Coordinate vector|vector]] and its [[covariance matrix|variance]] is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The [[inverse matrix]] of the variance-matrix is called the "information matrix". Because the variance of the estimator of a parameter vector is a matrix, the problem of "minimizing the variance" is complicated. Using [[statistical theory]], statisticians compress the  information-matrix using real-valued [[summary statistics]]; being real-valued functions, these "information criteria" can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, statisticians have evaluated estimators and designs by considering some [[summary statistics|summary statistic]] of the covariance matrix (of a [[Expected value|mean]]-[[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimator]]), usually with positive real values (like the [[determinant]] or [[matrix trace]]). Working with positive real-numbers brings several advantages: If the estimator of a single parameter has a positive variance, then the variance and the Fisher information are both positive real numbers; hence they are members of the convex cone of nonnegative real numbers (whose nonzero members have reciprocals in this same cone). &lt;br /&gt;
For several parameters, the covariance-matrices and information-matrices are elements of the convex cone of nonnegative-definite symmetric matrices in a [[partial order|partially]] [[ordered vector space]], under the [[Charles Loewner|Loewner]] (Löwner) order. This cone is closed under matrix-matrix addition, under matrix-inversion, and under the multiplication of positive real-numbers and matrices.

An exposition of matrix theory and the Loewner-order appears in Pukelsheim.
&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional optimality-criteria are [[Invariant theory|invariants]] of the [[Fisher information|information]] matrix; algebraically, the traditional optimality-criteria are [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the information matrix.

*'''A'''-optimality ("'''average'''" or '''trace''')
**One criterion is '''A-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the [[invertible matrix|inverse]] of the information matrix. This criterion results in minimizing the average variance of the estimates of the regression coefficients.
*'''C'''-optimality
**This criterion minimizes the variance of a [[best linear unbiased estimator]] of a predetermined linear combination of model parameters.
*'''D'''-optimality ('''determinant''')
**A popular criterion is '''D-optimality''', which seeks to minimize |(X'X)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;|, or equivalently maximize the [[determinant]] of the [[information matrix]] X'X of the design. This criterion results in maximizing the [[Differential entropy|differential Shannon information]] content of the parameter estimates.
*'''E'''-optimality ('''eigenvalue''')
**Another design is '''E-optimality''', which maximizes the minimum [[eigenvalue]] of the information matrix.
*'''T'''-optimality
**This criterion maximizes the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the information matrix.

Other optimality-criteria are concerned with the variance of [[Predictive inference|predictions]]:
*'''G'''-optimality
**A popular criterion is '''G-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the maximum entry in the [[diagonal#Matrices|diagonal]] of the [[hat matrix]] X(X'X)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;X'. This has the effect of minimizing the maximum variance of the predicted values.
*'''I'''-optimality ('''integrated''')
**A second criterion on prediction variance is '''I-optimality''', which seeks to minimize  the average prediction variance ''over the design space''.
*'''V'''-optimality ('''variance''')
**A third criterion on prediction variance is '''V-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the average prediction variance over a set of m specific points.&lt;ref&gt;The above optimality-criteria are convex functions on domains of [[Semidefinite programming|symmetric positive-semidefinite matrices]]: See an on-line textbook for practitioners, which has many illustrations and statistical applications:
* {{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}  (book in pdf)
Boyd and Vandenberghe discuss optimal experimental designs on pages 384–396.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrasts===
{{Main|Contrast (statistics)}} {{See also|Nuisance parameter}}
In many applications, the statistician is most concerned with a [[Nuisance parameter|"parameter of interest"]] rather than with [[Nuisance parameter|"nuisance parameters"]]. More generally, statisticians consider [[linear combination]]s of parameters, which are estimated via linear combinations of treatment-means in the [[design of experiments]] and in the [[analysis of variance]]; such linear combinations are called [[contrast (statistics)|contrasts]]. Statisticians can use appropriate optimality-criteria for such [[Nuisance parameter|parameters of interest]] and for more generally for [[Contrast (statistics)|contrasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Optimality criteria for [[nuisance parameter|"parameters of interest"]] and for [[Contrast (statistics)|contrasts]] are discussed by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Catalogs of optimal designs occur in books and in software libraries.

In addition, major [[List of statistical packages|statistical systems]] like [[SAS System|SAS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] have procedures for optimizing a design according to a user's specification. The experimenter must specify a [[Statistical model|model]] for the design and an optimality-criterion before the method can compute an optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;Iterative methods and approximation algorithms are surveyed in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and in the monographs of Fedorov (historical) and Pukelsheim, and in the survey article by Gaffke and Heiligers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical considerations==

Some advanced topics in optimal design require more [[statistical theory]] and practical knowledge in designing experiments.

===Model dependence and robustness===
Since the optimality criterion of most optimal designs is based on some function of the information matrix, the 'optimality' of a given design is ''[[Statistical model|model]] dependent'': While an optimal design is best for that [[Statistical model|model]], its performance may deteriorate on other [[Statistical model|models]]. On other [[Statistical model|models]], an ''optimal'' design can be either better or worse than a non-optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;See Kiefer ("Optimum Designs for Fitting Biased Multiresponse Surfaces" pages 289–299).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important to [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] the performance of designs under alternative [[Statistical model|models]].&lt;!--  and for several criteria --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such benchmarking is discussed in the textbook by Atkinson et al. and in the papers of Kiefer. ''[[Statistical model|Model]]-[[Robust statistics|robust]]'' designs (including "Bayesian" designs) are surveyed by Chang and Notz.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing an optimality criterion and robustness===
The choice of an appropriate optimality criterion requires some thought, and it is useful to benchmark the performance of designs with respect to several optimality criteria. Cornell writes that

{{quote|since the [traditional optimality] criteria . . . are variance-minimizing criteria, . . .  a design that is optimal for a given model using one of the . . . criteria is usually near-optimal for the same model with respect to the other criteria.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Cornell, John
|title=Experiments with Mixtures: Designs, Models, and the Analysis of Mixture Data
|edition=third
|publisher=Wiley
|year=2002
|isbn=0-471-07916-2
}} (Pages 400-401)
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, there are several classes of designs for which all the traditional optimality-criteria agree, according to the theory of "universal optimality" of [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]].&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to "universal optimality" appears in the textbook of Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias. More detailed expositions occur in the advanced textbook of Pukelsheim and the papers of Kiefer.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of practitioners like Cornell and the "universal optimality" theory of Kiefer suggest that robustness with respect to changes in the ''optimality-criterion'' is much greater than is robustness with respect to changes in the ''model''.

====Flexible optimality criteria and convex analysis====

High-quality statistical software provide a combination of libraries of optimal designs or iterative methods for constructing approximately optimal designs, depending on the model specified and the optimality criterion. Users may use a standard optimality-criterion or may program a custom-made criterion.

All of the traditional optimality-criteria are [[Convex function|convex (or concave) functions]], and therefore optimal-designs are amenable to the mathematical theory of [[convex analysis]] and their computation can use specialized methods of [[Convex optimization|convex minimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Computational methods are discussed by Pukelsheim and by Gaffke and Heiligers.&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner need not select ''exactly one'' traditional, optimality-criterion, but can specify a custom criterion. In particular, the practitioner can specify a convex criterion using the maxima of convex optimality-criteria and [[Conical combination|nonnegative combinations]] of optimality criteria (since these operations preserve [[convex functions]]). For ''convex'' optimality criteria, the [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] allows the practitioner to verify that a given design is globally optimal.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] is discussed in Chapter 9 of Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] is related with the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre]]-[[Fenchel's duality theorem|Fenchel]] [[Convex conjugate|conjugacy]] for [[convex function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pukelsheim uses [[convex analysis]] to study [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] in relation to the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre]]-[[Fenchel's duality theorem|Fenchel]] [[Convex conjugate|conjugacy]] for [[convex function]]s

The [[convex optimization|minimization]] of [[convex function]]s on domains of [[Semidefinite programming|symmetric positive-semidefinite matrices]] is explained in an on-line textbook for practitioners, which has many illustrations and statistical applications:
* {{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/| author9=Boyd, Stephen and Vandenberghe, Lieven}}  (book in pdf)
Boyd and Vandenberghe discuss optimal experimental designs on pages 384–396.
&lt;/ref&gt;

If an optimality-criterion lacks [[Quasiconvex function|convexity]], then finding a [[Global optimization|global optimum]] and verifying its optimality often are difficult.

===Model uncertainty and Bayesian approaches===

====Model selection====
{{See also|Model selection}}
When scientists wish to test several theories, then a statistician can design an experiment that allows optimal tests between specified models. Such "discrimination experiments" are especially important in the [[biostatistics]] supporting  [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], following the work of [[David R. Cox|Cox]] and Atkinson.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 20 in Atkinison, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bayesian experimental design====
{{Main|Bayesian experimental design}}
When practitioners need to consider multiple [[statistical model|models]], they can specify a [[Probability measure|probability-measure]] on the models and then select any design maximizing the [[expected value]] of such an experiment. Such probability-based optimal-designs are called optimal [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[Bayesian experimental design|designs]]. Such [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] are used especially for [[generalized linear models]] (where the response follows an [[Exponential family|exponential-family]] distribution).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] are discussed in Chapter 18 of the textbook by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias. More advanced discussions occur in the monograph by Fedorov and Hackl, and the articles by Chaloner and Verdinelli and by DasGupta. [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] and other aspects of "model-robust" designs are discussed by Chang and Notz.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian design]] does not force statisticians to use [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian methods]] to analyze the data, however. Indeed, the "Bayesian" label for probability-based experimental-designs is disliked by some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;As an alternative to "''Bayesian'' optimality", "''on-average'' optimality" is advocated in Fedorov and Hackl.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative terminology for "Bayesian" optimality includes "on-average" optimality or "population" optimality.

==Iterative experimentation==
Scientific experimentation is an iterative process, and statisticians have developed several approaches to the optimal design of sequential experiments.

===Sequential analysis===
{{Main|Sequential analysis}}
[[Sequential analysis]] was pioneered by [[Abraham Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Herman Chernoff]] wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs,&lt;ref&gt;Chernoff, H. (1972) ''Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design,'' SIAM Monograph.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] were surveyed later by S. Zacks.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, S.

North-Holland. {{isbn|0-444-82061-2}}.  (pages 151–180)&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, much work on the optimal design of experiments is related to the theory of [[optimal decision]]s, especially the [[statistical decision theory]] of [[Abraham Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Response-surface methodology===
{{Main|Response surface methodology}}
Optimal designs for [[Response surface methodology|response-surface models]] are discussed in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias, and in the survey of Gaffke and Heiligers and in the mathematical text of Pukelsheim. The [[Blocking (statistics)|blocking]] of optimal designs is discussed in the textbook of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and also in the monograph by Goos.

The earliest optimal designs were developed to estimate the parameters of regression models with continuous variables, for example, by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|J. D. Gergonne]] in 1815 (Stigler).  In English, two early contributions were made by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090810040534/http://www.webdoe.cc/publications/kirstine.php Kirstine Smith].

Pioneering designs for multivariate [[Response surface methodology|response-surfaces]] were proposed by [[George E. P. Box]]. However, Box's designs have few optimality properties. Indeed, the [[Box–Behnken design]] requires excessive experimental runs when the number of variables exceeds three.&lt;ref&gt;In the field of [[response surface methodology]], the [[Statistical efficiency|inefficiency]] of the [[Box–Behnken design]] is noted by Wu and Hamada (page 422).
* {{cite book |author1=Wu, C. F. Jeff  |author2=Hamada, Michael  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Parameter Design Optimization |publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |isbn=0-471-25511-4}}
Optimal designs for "follow-up" experiments are discussed by Wu and Hamada.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Box's [[Central composite design|"central-composite" designs]] require more experimental runs than do the optimal designs of Kôno.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Statistical efficiency|inefficiency]] of [[George E. P. Box|Box]]'s [[Central composite design|"central-composite" designs]] are discussed by according to Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias (page 165). These authors also discuss the [[Blocking (statistics)|blocking]] of Kôno-type designs for quadratic [[response surface methodology|response-surfaces]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===System identification and stochastic approximation===
{{See also|System identification|Stochastic approximation}}
The optimization of sequential experimentation is studied also in [[stochastic programming]] and in [[Systems analysis|systems]] and [[Control theory|control]]. Popular methods include [[stochastic approximation]] and other methods of [[stochastic optimization]]. Much of this research has been associated with the subdiscipline of [[system identification]].&lt;ref&gt;In system identification, the following books have chapters on optimal experimental design:
* {{cite book |author1=Goodwin, Graham C.  |author2=Payne, Robert L. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dynamic [[System identification|System Identification]]: Experiment Design and Data Analysis | publisher=Academic Press | year=1977 |isbn=0-12-289750-1}}
* {{cite book |author1=Walter, Éric  |author2=Pronzato, Luc  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=[[System identification|Identification]] of Parametric Models from Experimental Data |publisher=Springer |year=1997}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In computational [[optimal control]], D. Judin &amp; A. Nemirovskii and [http://www.ipu.ru/labs/lab7/eng/staff/polyak.htm Boris Polyak] has described methods that are more efficient than the ([[Armijo rule|Armijo-style]]) [[Subgradient method#Step size rules|step-size rules]] introduced by [[George E. P. Box|G. E. P. Box]] in [[Response surface methodology|response-surface methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Some step-size rules for of Judin &amp; Nemirovskii and of [http://www.ipu.ru/labs/lab7/eng/staff/polyak.htm Polyak] are explained in the textbook by Kushner and Yin:

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minimisation (clinical trials)|Adaptive designs]] are used in [[clinical trials]], and optimal [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] are surveyed in the ''Handbook of Experimental Designs'' chapter by Shelemyahu Zacks.

==Specifying the number of experimental runs==

===Using a computer to find a good design===

There are several methods of finding an optimal design, given an ''a priori'' restriction on the number of experimental runs or replications. Some of these methods are discussed by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and in the paper by Hardin and [[Neil Sloane|Sloane]]. Of course, fixing the number of experimental runs ''a priori'' would be impractical.  Prudent statisticians examine the other optimal designs, whose number of experimental runs differ.

===Discretizing probability-measure designs===

In the mathematical theory on optimal experiments, an optimal design can be a [[probability measure]] that is [[Support (measure theory)|supported]] on an infinite set of observation-locations. Such optimal probability-measure designs solve a mathematical problem that neglected to specify the cost of observations and experimental runs. Nonetheless, such optimal probability-measure designs can be [[Discretization|discretized]] to furnish [[Approximation|approximately]] optimal designs.&lt;ref&gt;The [[discretization]] of optimal probability-measure designs to provide [[Approximation|approximately]] optimal designs is discussed by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias and by Pukelsheim (especially Chapter 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a finite set of observation-locations suffices to [[Support (measure theory)|support]] an optimal design. Such a result was proved by Kôno and [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] in their works on [[Response surface methodology|response-surface designs]] for quadratic models. The Kôno–Kiefer analysis explains why optimal designs for response-surfaces can have discrete supports, which are very similar as do the less efficient designs that have been traditional in [[response surface methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Regarding designs for quadratic [[response surface methodology|response-surfaces]], the results of Kôno and [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] are discussed in Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.

Mathematically, such results are associated with [[Chebyshev polynomials]], "Markov systems", and "moment spaces": See

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1815, an article on optimal designs for [[polynomial regression]] was published by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]], according to [[Stephen M. Stigler|Stigler]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] proposed an economic theory of scientific experimentation in 1876, which sought to maximize the precision of the estimates. Peirce's optimal allocation immediately improved the accuracy of gravitational experiments and was used for decades by Peirce and his colleagues. In his 1882 published lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Peirce introduced experimental design with these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Logic will not undertake to inform you what kind of experiments you ought to make in order best to determine the acceleration of gravity, or the value of the Ohm; but it will tell you how to proceed to form a plan of experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;[....] Unfortunately practice generally precedes theory, and it is the usual fate of mankind to get things done in some boggling way first, and find out afterward how they could have been done much more easily and perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1882), "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, published in ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1882, see p. 11, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Logic+will+not+undertake+to+inform%22+%22unfortunately+practice+generally%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, see 59, 63, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 4, pp. 378–82, see 378, 379, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 210–14, see 210–1, also lower down on 211.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kirstine Smith]] proposed optimal designs for polynomial models in 1918. (Kirstine Smith had been a student of the Danish statistician [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] and was working with [[Karl Pearson]] in London.)

====Textbooks emphasizing block designs====
Optimal [[Randomized block design|block designs]] are discussed by Bailey and by Bapat. The first chapter of Bapat's book reviews the [[linear algebra]] used by Bailey (or the advanced books below). Bailey's exercises and discussion of [[random assignment|randomization]] both emphasize statistical concepts (rather than algebraic computations).

'''Partial impact theory''' is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] theory describing the partial collision of two [[star]]s and the temporary creation of a bright third [[star]] as a consequence. The theory was explained in [[Alexander William Bickerton]]'s book ''The Romance of the Heavens'' published in 1901.

In ''The Romance of the Heavens'' [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] states that a slight ''"grazing"'' collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars. So he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days.

The theory explains that when the two [[Star|stellar]] bodies graze each other, the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star. Their velocity will cancel each other's out transforming this energy into heat. While the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision. The third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars.

The temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light, after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a [[planetary nebula]], and eventually dissipates into [[space]]. [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] explains this bright temporary star by saying that it doesn't disappear due to cooling, but that it was too hot to hold together.

The temperature of the third star, isn't dependent on the amount of contact between the two original stars, but rather the chemical makeup of the stars and their velocities going into the collision. The stability of the third body depends on the size of the contact of the original stars, if the contact was small then the mass of the newly created third body will find it harder to attract [[molecules]] to it. Rather than if it had a larger mass where molecules would find it more difficult to escape from its larger gravitational pull.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, A.W, (1901).''The Romance of the Heavens''. London. Swan Sonnencchein &amp; Co., Lim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physiological movements''' or [[normal movements]] are the natural movements that occur in human joints. They are also known as [[osteokinematic]] movements.

The study of these movements is known as [[kinesiology]].

Police are often a significant source of abuse for sex workers, particularly poor sex workers. Greater exposure to the police often means more experience of police abuse; one study found that sex workers with greater police oversight were more likely to be obliged to provide free sexual services to the police than sex workers with less police oversight.&lt;ref name="levittChicago"/&gt; For some groups of sex workers in some locations in the U.S., police are the primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="torrezChicago"/&gt; Police may be the most abusive towards sex workers who have experienced the most victimization from other sources; a study found that sex workers who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work were more likely to suffer police abuse than sex workers who chose to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="burnsAlaska"/&gt; 

Police abuse can have long lasting consequences; when police falsely arrest someone for prostitution, the resulting criminal record may make it difficult for that person to find jobs or get housing. Incarceration and court attendance for false charges can disrupt efforts to pursue careers outside of sex work, as when a student misses classes.&lt;ref name="viceNYC"/&gt; Seemingly innocuous actions can affect safety; when officers tell sex workers to "move along", the workers often end up in areas where they feel less safe.&lt;ref name="arringtonDC"/&gt; When police target an HIV+ person for repeated arrests, they may prevent the person from going to scheduled appointments with health care providers, and jail disrupts medication routines.&lt;ref name="hrwNewOrleans"/&gt; And sometimes abuse creates physical harm that is immediate and intentional, as when police officers physically assault a sex worker without evidence of crime and without making an arrest.&lt;ref name="thukral0NYC"/&gt;

This article lists government investigations, research reports, and news articles that describe police abuse of sex workers in the United States, and gives a description of the relevant information from each document.

Excerpt from a sex worker story:

{{ quote

Um, left me with some broken fingertips, broken toes, fractured cheekbone... I was bleeding, I had my skirt ripped... people were just mortified because they'd seen a teenage girl get assaulted by a police officer...
| author= study respondent
}}

The general trend of the study statistics was that the sex workers who had suffered the worst victimization in the past were the ones most likely to be abused by the police.

The following tables compare the experiences of three groups: all the respondents in the study, the respondents where were manipulated or coerced into sex work, and the respondents who were forced into sex work.

Respondents who were manipulated or coerced into sex work were more likely to attempt to report a crime, but the police were less likely to take their report and more likely to threaten or arrest them.

The DOJ found "indications that the BCPD disregards reports of sexual assault by people involved in the sex trade..." Investigators heard from the community that officers were coercing sexual favors from sex workers. Internal records indicated that this was true and the officers weren't being punished. Prior to the DOJ investigation, an internal investigation by the BCPD found an officer receiving sex from a sex worker in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. The case was closed without any attempt to gather more evidence, interview the police officer, or prosecute the officer. Cases were opened for the same officer a second and third time for the same offense. The witness for the third case died before she could be interviewed, and only then did the BCPD review the officer's phone records and discover that he had sent sexually explicit messages to a number of female sex workers. The officer was allowed to retire. The DOJ found similar cases involving other officers.

The primary form of police abuse was coercive sex, through the threat of arrest. In some cases the officer received the sexual service and arrested the sex worker anyway.

This is a working paper that was never published, as far as I know. However, the PDF file is freely available and some of the results are discussed in Levitt and Dubner's book ''SuperFreakonomics''. 

The study compared two neighborhoods, one where none of the women had pimps, and one where all the women had pimps. The women without pimps were more likely to be arrested and three percent of all sexual services were provided to police officers free of charge. The women with pimps were less likely to be arrested and didn't provide free sexual services. Sex workers were more likely to have sex with a police officer than be arrested by one.

Twenty four percent of street-based sex workers had been raped by a police officer. Twenty percent had experienced other sexual assault from police officers. Women doing survival sex and women in drug houses experienced a lot of violence from police. Thirty percent of exotic dancers who had been raped were raped by police, and twenty percent of the sexual violence they experienced was committed by police. Twenty five percent of escorts had been robbed by a police officer. Eighteen percent of escorts had been forced to masturbate a police officer.

This is a survey of bad encounters experienced by young people in the sex trade and street economy. Bad encounters were divided into three categories: violence, harassment, and refusal to help. The largest source of both harassment and violence was the category of police, which included the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and security guards in schools. Sexual violence by police made up 11% of all bad encounters.

One of the main findings was that institutional violence made individual violence worse. When girls suffered harm and sought help, the system they were seeking help from often did more harm. An example was a girl being arrested when she tried to file a report for rape. Or this:

{{ quote
| text= I went to the hospital for a rape kit and when I got there the police officer accused me and my advocate of not cooperating. The officer started yelling at us both and said I was going to jail for lying. The officer never filed a report but called Child Services and I got sent to a group home but nothing ever happened with the rape.
}}

Another finding was that bad encounters increase when institutions work together. In over 40% of bad encounters with police, another institution was involved. Young people run away from hospitals, foster care, and other service systems because they are physically, emotionally, or sexually harmed or neglected. When police forcibly return someone to one of these settings, they place the young person back in the harmful situation they were escaping from.

An example of police working with another institution to scare a person away from getting help:

{{ quote
| text= I got hit on the head by someone on the train. The police took me to the hospital. The hospital tried to put me in the psych ward because I was transgender. They said I couldn't leave the hospital even though I didn't want to stay. They called the policeman back to try to force me to stay because they said I was a minor. I went to the bathroom then hid and left before they got there.
}}

The result was that the person never got the medical help they needed because of gender discrimination and fear of being put in a psych ward.

The researchers found that police frequently sexually assaulted youth in the sex trade. The following story, sex followed by arrest, was repeated many times:

{{ quote
| text= I was solicited by a police officer who said that if I had sex with him he wouldn't arrest me. So I did. Then afterwards he cuffed me and pressed charges anyway.
}}

Sometimes it was worse.

{{ quote
| text= I was going to meet a new john, it turned out to be a sting set up by the cops. He got violent with me, handcuffed me and then raped me. He cleaned me up for the police station and I got sentenced to four months in jail for prostitution.
}}

Young trans women profiled as prostitutes was another common story.

{{ quote
| text= I keep being arrested in Rogers Park just for standing still. They keep taking me in for prostitution even though I'm not doing anything at all. It's the same white cop doing it too.
}}

From the point of view of the young people in the study, the transition to an anti-trafficking regime hasn't made much difference.

{{ quote
| text= When being held in protective custody [because they said I was a victim of human trafficking] they started withholding my sheets, then towels, then pillows, then food because they said I wasn't telling them everything I could&amp;mdash;when in fact I was.
}}

And this:

{{ quote
| text= I was receiving a rape kit after a trafficking experience and the detective was questioning me and my advocate. The officer physically wouldn't let me out of the room. She threatened to send me and my advocate to jail unless we reported what happened [but I didn't want to tell her about my experience.] The officer got loud and in our faces, swore at us and made a big scene. I got between the officer and my advocate to get her out of my advocate's face. As soon as I could I ran out the door but the officer grabbed my arm so I pushed away and hid until I could get out of the hospital.

The sample consists of one hundred sixty nine respondents between the ages of thirteen and twenty four.

One respondent was given the choice between arrest and doing something "disgusting". She wouldn't tell the researcher what she was asked to do, but she told the other police officers at the station about it and they laughed at her.

A respondent was asked by an officer to show her breasts in order to avoid arrest. Another respondent had charges dropped because of police misconduct; the officer who arrested her had her perform oral sex on him.

Survey respondents said that police profiled transgender people as sex workers and subjected them to verbal abuse and sexual misconduct, including demands for sex in exchange for leniency. Police were arresting people for solicitation if they carried condoms. Even trans sex workers who weren't arrested for carrying condoms saw it happen to others and where afraid to carry condoms. Some police officers used possession of condoms to coerce trans sex workers into providing free sexual services. 

People who tested positive for HIV while in jail were visited by an HIV task force that scheduled appointments at a clinic. However, many people were rearrested before their scheduled appointment. One woman was arrested ten times in three years, preventing her from going to any scheduled appointments to receive care for her HIV infection during that period. Jail interrupts taking medication on a regular basis.

Transgender youth reported being picked up for prostitution or loitering for prostitution when they weren't working. One eighteen year old transgender youth reported being extorted for sex by police officers eight times. Once arrested, transgender youth were more likely to be sexually exploited by jail staff than cisgender youth were. 

Two quotes from cisgender respondents:

This study covered NYC as well as a few upstate counties. Most of the data came from NYC.

Police officers propositioned underage youth and made lewd comments. Most female youth in the study reported trading sex to avoid arrest. Pimps were not arrested or received less jail time than the youth that worked with them, even when one of the youths was identified as fourteen years old.

Abuse varied by location and police officer. Women were more likely to be arrested or ticketed in Brooklyn. Interactions with police in the Bronx were more likely to involve off-duty officers. However, a white woman in the Bronx reported that the police targeted her because she was white, telling her that she was making white people look bad. In Bushwick police harassment was so bad that a service organization was forced to change its location to protect its outreach staff. Latinas reported the worst harassment, including name-calling, stalking, and throwing food. A couple of women based in Bushwick reported daily harassment that caused them to avoid leaving their homes.

Examples of police language: 

{{ quote
| text= bitch

ho

slut

you're not dead yet?

we gotta go clean up the trash

why should we help you?
}}

A transwoman said she was subjected to constant harassment, and the officers who harassed her were the ones who wanted "oral sex on the side."

Thirty percent of the respondents reported threats of violence from the police, and twenty seven percent reported experiencing violence. One respondent said "I've seen cops get out of a car and beat a girl, and then get back in the car and leave." Another said that her greatest fear during arrest was "not coming home at all." The white woman from the Bronx said "... they throw you on the floor and they step on you..."

Another respondent reported seeing officers injure a women in the pelvic area to prevent her from working.
{{ quote
| text= ... it was like he was squeezing a handball or something, but really really hard... it was two guys in a car and they drove up on the sidewalk. He pushed her against the wall and then he pushed her against the wall after he finished that and then he said "now get off the street"...
| author= respondent
}}

One respondent reported that an officer followed her for thirty blocks in his civilian car. Another reported that an officer followed her and warned off clients with his bullhorn. Another reported that an officer felt her breasts and made her expose them as cars were driving by while he wrote a ticket. Some statements made by police officers to sex workers:

{{ quote
|text= It's hot tonight, it's a sweep, you should get out of here, now what can you do for me?

You wanna get arrested or you wanna give up some head?

I gave you two cigarettes, you want anything else, you know what you can do for me.

Can I rub against you for $10? [said during arrest]

Either you give me a blow job or I'm going to lock you up.
| author= various police officers, quoted by study respondents
}}

Several respondents reported having money stolen while being searched or arrested.

A sampling of the false arrest stories:

*A respondent reported getting a summons while waiting to have her hair done. 

*A transwomen who was first arrested for prostitution at age fifteen reported that "I got arrested for prostitution long before I knew what prostitution was." She also said "... they just snatch you coming out of the subway, just because you're a tranny." 

*A ciswoman was approached in a park by an officer who checked and discovered that she had no outstanding warrants. He walked away and another officer approached her and arrested her. She was held for five hours before being released. By way of explanation, a police officer said "See this sheet? All these warrants aren't yours.[sic]"

*Another woman reported being stopped coming out of a grocery store. The police spilled her groceries on the ground and arrested her for prostitution.

This is an article from the Vice website. It opens with an ex-sex worker's story of false arrest; when she turned down an undercover officer's offer of money for sex, the police arrested her anyway. Because of being locked up, she missed a day of classes she needed to start a career outside of sex work. She informed the reporter that it's common for new officers to arrest women walking to the park where she was arrested, even though they're not working. One woman was arrested because the police said she was waving while wearing a low cut top and a miniskirt. Her attorney took pictures of her at arraignment wearing a jacket and pants and got the charges dropped. Another woman was arrested while wearing a peacoat and jeans that "outlined her legs."

A transwoman named Ryhannah Combs was picked up on prostitution charges while running errands. She was carrying no condoms but the arresting officer said she was carrying nine. Instead of being put in a cell, she was chained to a wall. The city settled when she sued.

A staff attorney at the Trafficking Victims Advocacy Project said that the police frequently verbally abused her clients when arresting them, and on multiple occasions have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.

Women who are addicted and becoming dope sick are targeted for sex. This was described as "a deal with the Devil," because the police officer will keep coming back for information, sex, or an easy arrest.

Study data was drawn from 1,400 client records from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project. The researchers also interviewed twenty EIP clients who had had prostitution-related offenses cleared from their record.

Some of the study respondents had positive or neutral experiences with the police, but most of them had overwhelmingly negative experiences: verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and profiling.

Verbal abuse included slurs, derogatory comments, and refusal to use the person's native language, even when able to do so. Police used humiliation to extract cooperation. One trans woman described particularly intense humiliation, recurring with each arrest.

Some respondents had been propositioned by the police or had police as clients. One respondent described an officer who started off as a client. After their last session he came back the next day in his uniform and arrested her.

Some respondents reported repeated prostitution arrests by the same officer, even when the women weren't working. One woman was arrested while going to the store in pajamas and bedroom slippers. She described another arrest that occurred while she was meeting a cousin for dinner. She was charged even though the cousin came to the police station and told the police what they had been doing. One respondent described a police officer stating that he would lock her up if he saw her on the street.

Some respondents who were trafficked or victims of violence sought help from the police, only to be ridiculed or ignored.

The study sample was fifty two indoor sex workers.

63% of the respondents had police-initiated contact with the police, but 63% of those said the contact was rare. Only one person, a trans woman, had police-initiated contact as often as a couple of times a week. The police in her neighborhood knew her because she had previously worked outdoors. They harassed her, honking at her as she was walking down the street, telling her to go home or they would arrest her, and calling her "Mr." or "homeboy". Another trans woman said the police harassed her because she was transgender.

Several respondents said that during arrests, police took their pictures with personal cameras. They believed the pictures were for the officers' personal use. 12% of respondents had been falsely arrested at least once.

29% of respondents had been taken into custody but released without arrest. The researchers believe the lack of police follow up indicates that there was no basis for taking the people into custody.

14% of respondents had experienced police violence and felt they had no recourse. One woman said she was beaten twice, both times because she refused to give police officers free oral sex. The first time, after she bit the officer's penis, he beat her until she passed out. Another woman was having problems with a particularly violent officer:

{{ quote
| text= One likes to beat me now and then, or he wants me to suck his dick. I mean, it's crazy. He hits me with his gun and gives me these marks on my legs and my back. I don't know what to do...

I can't call the other cops. I did that once and they asked this guy to stop beating me. But he got so mad that he came around and beat me up even worse. So I really have to get out of here. Now he wants me to give him 25% of what I make...

I had to go to the hospital because I got beat so bad.

Four respondents said that police had stolen money. One said that police steal from her about once a year. Two respondents had $4,000 and a laptop stolen from them during an arrest.

16% of respondents said they had been in sexual situations with the police. Some had sex with the police for protection or because the officers were customers, but others were picked up by the police and given the choice between sex and arrest.

Some of the Latinos reported regular police harassment.

The study sample was two hundred eighty three young people selected through RDS.

Most of the respondents had been profiled, but only a small number were profiled for sex work. White and black youth were more likely to be profiled than Latinx. A black Dominican trans woman described moving into Manhattan and talking a walk around her new neighborhood. A police officer stopped her and told her she had better not be "on a stroll." At the time, she didn't know what a stroll was.

14% of respondents described being threatened with arrest unless they had sex with a police officer. 8% said they were arrested after having sex with a police officer. 5% said they were arrested after refusing to have sex with a police officer. 40% of interactions with police officers during the previous three months were bad or very bad.

For interactions initiated by the police, 38.5% of survey respondents reported being humiliated or verbally abused by police during relatively minor interactions such as checking ID. One respondent said the officer called her a whore, prostitute, and trick. During 8.6% of these interactions, officers confiscated or destroyed safe sex supplies, including condoms. 17.3% of respondents said that police-initiated interactions involved the officer asking for sexual services, or demanding sexual services to avoid arrest. 9.1% of respondents reported being assaulted by police officers. 3 respondents reported strip searches.

Seventy eight respondents were profiled as sex workers and ordered to "move along." The most common result of this was that they ended up in an area where they felt less safe.

75% of trans people and 82.4% of Latinos said they were treated worse than others when they were in lock up.

When the survey respondents initiated contact with the police, usually to report a crime, in a number of cases the police tried to have sex with them. This seemed to be particularly true of trans Latinas.

This is an overview of the literature available at the time of publication on law enforcement abuse of various groups of women. There's a short discussion of sex workers at the end.

Police abuse of sex workers includes verbal insults, coerced sex, brutal beatings, and rape. When police know that a woman is a sex worker, they may harass her when she is not working. 

The most common abuses are verbal abuse and threats to arrest sex workers if the police don't receive sexual services. Police often assume that sex workers don't care who they will have sex with and will do anything to avoid arrest. But experienced street-based sex workers often refuse to provide free services. They are resigned to frequent arrests, including arrests for questionable charges. What they want to avoid are fear and indignity forced on them by bad officers.

One observer describes Chicago police picking up sex workers when the workers are on their way to and from work, and asking for sexual services. New York City police have threatened to shut down sex parlors if they didn't get free sexual services. Women picked up in raids have been taken away in their underwear and had their possessions confiscated.

Trans female sex workers face these and other more complex forms of abuse. If their official documentation doesn't match their gender presentation, they may face verbal abuse and cruel jokes centered around the difference. They may be subjected to unnecessary and illegal strip searches, ostensibly to determine their gender.

Police use sex work to profile people, stop them on the street, intimidate and question them, check for warrants, and often arrest them.

The discussion of sex work ends with the description of two rapes suffered by Mary Barr. In the first, a police officer chased off her client and then told her she might as well have sex with him because the client had already paid. In the second, an officer ordered her into the back seat of his car, told her "do what you do best," and then raped her.

Best Practices Policy Project, Desiree Alliance, and Sex Workers Outreach Project- NYC

2014-09-15

This was submitted as part of the UN Universal Periodic Review of the U.S.A.

During arrest or taking someone into custody, police often degrade or humiliate sex workers, including removing wigs or clothing, confiscating or destroying property, making homophobic, anti-transgender, and racists slurs, and engaging on sexual harassment. Organizations working with sex workers have documented a pattern of police practice that includes assault, sexual harassment, public strip searches for the purpose of viewing genitalia, and rape. This pattern of practice is supported by the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining justice in these cases. 

Police are able to extend this abuse from sex workers to trans women and women of color by profiling them as sex workers. A study in Los Angeles of Latina trans women found that 42% reported being solicited for sex by law enforcement and 24% reported being sexually abused by police officers.

When sex workers try to report crimes against them, officers don't take their complaints seriously, refuse to file a report, and may arrest them, physically assault them, or pressure them for sex. When a sex worker tried to bring charges against a security guard who handcuffed and raped her, the police referred to the guard as "a big teddy bear", and added exculpatory statements to her report that she didn't make. This refusal to deal with crimes against sex workers leads serial killers to target sex workers and people profiled as sex workers.

While most witnesses who are in danger because of their testimony are put in witness protection programs, sex workers are pressured to testify by putting them in jail, exposing them to witness intimidation and denying them their right to liberty. An African-American trans female sex worker was placed in the mens' jail in Baltimore in an effort to compel her to testify in a violent crime case. Police in some areas force sex workers to participate in drug stings, exposing them to violence from the people targeted by the stings.

In New York, transgender and gender non-conforming people are often profiled as sex workers and arrested. They then have to decide whether to request being held as a "special category" prisoner. If they make the request, police are often harsh, holding them alone in a back cell longer than usual or assaulting them. If no empty cells are available, police chain them to a desk or metal bar, often for hours at a time. If they don't make the request, they may be put in a cell where they aren't safe, or the police may incite trouble with the other prisoners by saying "here's another [anti-LGBT slur] for you."

Police discourage the use of condoms by using condoms as evidence, or they destroy condoms and safe sex supplies. This encourages the spread of HIV and STIs. Carrying condoms may also be a signal for sexual harassment, cuing police to ask intrusive questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, touch inappropriately, and make disparaging comments. Police particularly target young women of color and trans youth and gender non-conforming youth of color.

Sex workers with severe injuries from violent attacks are often belittled and blamed for the attacks, and police often don't escort them or refer them to medical care. People in medical facilities seeking care for injuries from attacks have been accusingly questioned by police officers when they were profiled as sex workers.

The study sample consisted of fifteen woman who were sex workers, trafficked victims, or both.

Six of the twelve women who had been trafficking victims left their trafficking situation without help from law enforcement, through the help of a coworker or an attorney they met through a coworker or friend. Nationwide, it appears that the majority of trafficking victims escape without the involvement of law enforcement. One supervisor in a national organization said that 90% of their cases were not produced by raids or identified by law enforcement.

(N.b. Most people who fit the legal definition of trafficking victim seem to exit trafficking without any organizational help. In a study of underage sex workers in NYC, only 2% said they would ever go to a service organization if they were in trouble.&lt;ref name="curtisNYC"/&gt; On the whole, they age out of sex work rather than being "rescued." Young sex workers studied in NYC and Atlantic City experienced greater control over their work over time, regardless of whether they had pimps.

| date= 2014-03-28

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, it appears that the majority of people who fall under the category of trafficking victim exit the category through their own efforts. Only a minority of trafficking victims exit trafficking with help from organizations created to help them. Of that minority, only a further minority, perhaps 10%, are identified by law enforcement. And this study suggests that most of the people picked up in raids could have been rescued or self-rescued in other, less traumatic ways, had they been aware of the help available to them.)

Of the six trafficking victims picked up in law enforcement raids, one would have left her situation in a few days if she had not been picked up in a raid and arrested. As a result of the raid, she was pistol-whipped by a police officer and incarcerated. Her conclusion:

{{ quote
| text= A better way to help leave my situation would be anything that didn't involve the police.
}}

Another would have left on her own if she had known where to go, and another said that she would have preferred leaving with a coworker rather than being picked up in a raid. One didn't know another way to escape, but still thought the raid was "terrible." Had these women known of the resources available to trafficked people, they very likely could have left on their own and gotten the assistance they needed without the trauma or injury of a raid.

Raids often involve intimidation, verbal abuse, excessive force, and sexual harassment. Raids result in detention and deportation of trafficking victims who are afraid to come forward, or who come forward and aren't believed. Victims who aren't detained or deported are often terrorized into silence. 

The respondents who experienced raids didn't know which government agency was raiding them, and in one case initially knew only that they were being attacked by people carrying guns. They didn't know what purpose the raids had, other than to detain and deport them, and they didn't know what was going to happen to them.

The women who left trafficking situations on their own, without being traumatized by a law enforcement raid, were better able to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws?

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

[[File:Raphides from variegated ivy.jpg|thumb|Raphides in ''[[Epipremnum]]'' ''[[Epipremnum aureum|Devil's ivy]]'' (600x magnification)]]
'''Raphides''' are needle-shaped crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] as the monohydrate or [[calcium carbonate]] as aragonite, found in more than 200 families of plants.
Both ends are needle-like, but raphides tend to be blunt at one end and sharp at the other.

== Calcium oxalate in plants ==
[[File:raphide.jpg|thumb|left| Raphides in ''[[Hypoestes phyllostachya]]'', the polka dot plant]]

Many plants accumulate calcium oxalate crystals in response to surplus calcium, which is found throughout the natural environment. The crystals are produced in an intriguing variety of shapes. The crystal morphology depends on the taxonomic group of the plant. In one study of over 100 species, it was found that calcium oxalate accounted for 6.3% of plant dry weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1105/tpc.11.4.751|title=Cell-Mediated Crystallization of Calcium Oxalate in Plants|journal=The Plant Cell Online|volume=11|issue=4|pages=751–761|year=1999|last1=Webb|first1=M. A.|pmid=10213791|pmc=144206|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC144206/pdf|format=Full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal morphology and the distribution of raphides (in roots or leaves or tubers etc.) is similar in some taxa but different in others leaving possible opportunities for plant key characteristics and systematic identification; mucilage in raphide containing cells makes light microscopy difficult, though. Little is known about the mechanisms of sequestration or indeed the reason for accumulation of raphides but it is most likely as a defense mechanism against herbivory. It has also been suggested that in some cases raphides may help form plant skeletal structure. Raphides typically occur in [[parenchyma]] cells in aerial organs especially the leaves, and are generally confined to the mesophyll. As the leaf area increases, so does the number of raphides, the process starting in even young leaves. The first indications that the cell will contain crystals is shown when the cells enlarge with a larger nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/11/2/339.full.pdf|pmid=4342516|year=1972|author1=Horner Jr|first1=H. T.|title=Raphide crystal cell development in leaves of Psychotria punctata (Rubiaceae)|journal=Journal of Cell Science|volume=11|issue=2|pages=339–55|last2=Whitmoyer|first2=R. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphides are found in specialized plant cells or crystal chambers called [[idioblast]]s.&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02124a034|url=http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/scientific-american/sup7/Raphides-The-Cause-Of-The-Acridity-Of-Certain-Plants.html|title=Raphides, the Cause of the Acridity of Certain Plants|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=13|issue=7|pages=215–217|year=1891|last1=Weber|first1=R. A.}}  Also, {{DOI|10.1038/scientificamerican11211891-13242csupp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electron micrographs have shown that raphide needle crystals are normally four sided or H-shaped (with a groove down both sides) or with a hexagonal cross section and some are barbed. Wattendorf (1976) suggested that all circular sectioned raphides, as visible in a light microscope, are probably hexagonal in cross section&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00387837|pmid=24424644|title=A third type of raphide crystal in the plant kingdom: Six-sided raphides with laminated sheaths in Agave americana L|journal=Planta|volume=130|issue=3|pages=303–11|year=1976|last1=Wattendorff|first1=Joachim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopy using polarized light shows bright opalescence with raphides. Plants like Tradescantia pallida also accumulate calcium oxalate crystals in response to heavy metals stress.

== Harmful effects ==
Raphides can produce severe toxic reactions by facilitating the passage of toxin through the herbivore's skin when the tissue containing the raphides also contains toxins. The lethal dose to mice is around 15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18533491|year=2008|author1=Wu|first1=H|title=Study on irritation of calcium oxalate crystal in Araceae plants|journal=Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi|language=Chinese|volume=33|issue=4|pages=380–4|last2=Zhong|first2=L. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphides seem to be a defense mechanism against plant predators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10648203|jstor=3080127|year=2000|author1=Arnott|first1=H. J.|title=Twinned Raphides of Calcium Oxalate in Grape (Vitis): Implications for Crystal Stability and Function|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=161|issue=1|pages=133–142|last2=Webb|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1086/314230}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are likely to tear and harm the soft tissues of the throat or esophagus of a plant predator chewing on the plant's leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants/taro-0|  title=Animal Poison Control Center: Taro|work= ASPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/p/plant_poisoning_calcium_oxalate_crystals/intro.htm| title=Plant poisoning -- Calcium oxalate crystals |work=Right Diagnosis from Healthgrades}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venomous process is in two stages: mechanical pricking and injection of harmful protease. Typically ingestion of plants containing raphides, like those common in certain houseplants, can cause immediate numbing followed shortly by painful [[edema]], vesicle formation and [[dysphagia]] accompanied by painful stinging and burning to the mouth and throat with symptoms occurring for up to two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1081/CLT-44721 |pmid=15732442 |title=Outbreak of Food-borne Illness Associated with Plant Material Containing Raphides |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=17–21 |year=2005 |last1=Watson |first1=John T. |last2=Jones |first2=Roderick C. |last3=Siston |first3=Alicia M. |last4=Diaz |first4=Pamela S. |last5=Gerber |first5=Susan I. |last6=Crowe |first6=John B. |last7=Satzger |first7=R. Duane }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airway assessment and management are of the highest priority, as are extensive irrigation and analgesics in eye exposure.

Raphides cannot normally be destroyed by boiling; that requires an acidic environment or chemical solvents like ether, but heating raphide containing plant materials (like tubers) can fix the raphides into a dried starchy matrix so they are no longer mobile and thus less harmful. Some other plants store raphides in mucilaginous environments and also do not taste acrid.&lt;ref name="weber" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11562">{{For|the notion of upper or lower semicontinuous [[multivalued function]]|Hemicontinuity}}

In [[mathematical analysis]], '''semi-continuity''' (or '''semicontinuity''') is a property of [[extended real number|extended real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s that is weaker than [[continuous function|continuity]]. An extended real-valued function ''f'' is '''upper''' (respectively, '''lower''') '''semi-continuous''' at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if, roughly speaking, the function values for arguments near ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are either close to ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) or less than (respectively, greater than) ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Examples ==
[[Image:Upper semi.svg|thumb|right|An upper semi-continuous function. The solid blue dot indicates ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).]]
Consider the  function ''f'', [[piecewise]] defined by ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= –1 for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. This function is upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, but not lower semi-continuous.

[[Image:Lower semi.svg|thumb|right|A lower semi-continuous function. The solid blue dot indicates ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).]]
The [[indicator function]] of a [[closed set]] is upper semi-continuous, whereas the indicator function of an [[open set]] is lower semi-continuous. The [[floor function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number ''x'', is everywhere upper semi-continuous. Similarly, the [[ceiling function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt; is lower semi-continuous.

A function may be upper or lower semi-continuous without being either [[Continuous function#Directional and semi-continuity|left or right continuous]]. For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
               1   &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 1,\\
               2   &amp; \mbox{if } x = 1,\\
               1/2 &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 1,
               \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
is upper semi-continuous at ''x'' = 1 although not left or right continuous.  The limit from the left is equal to 1 and the limit from the right is equal to 1/2, both of which are different from the function value of 2.  Similarly the function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \begin{cases}
                \sin(1/x) &amp; \mbox{if } x \neq 0,\\
                1         &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0,
                \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is upper semi-continuous at ''x'' = 0 while the function limits from the left or right at zero do not even exist.

If &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a Euclidean space (or more generally, a metric space) and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=C([0,1],X)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of [[curve]]s in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (with the [[supremum norm|supremum distance]] &lt;math&gt;d_\Gamma(\alpha,\beta)=\sup_t\ d_X(\alpha(t),\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;, then the length functional &lt;math&gt;L:\Gamma\to[0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, which assigns to each curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; its [[Curve#Length of curves|length]] &lt;math&gt;L(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, is lower semicontinuous.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a measure space and let &lt;math&gt;L^+(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of positive measurable functions endowed with the
topology of [[convergence in measure]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by [[Fatou's lemma]] the integral, seen as an operator from &lt;math&gt;L^+(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[-\infty,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is lower semi-continuous.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]], &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is an extended real-valued function.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''upper semi-continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \leq f(x_0) + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) &gt; -\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends towards &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

For the particular case of a metric space, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x\to x_{0}} f(x)\le f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where lim sup is the [[limit superior]] (of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;). (For non-metric spaces, an equivalent definition using [[net (mathematics)|net]]s may be stated.)

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called upper semi-continuous if it is upper semi-continuous at every point of its [[domain (function)|domain]]. A function is upper semi-continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x \in X: ~f(x) &lt; \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set]] for every &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''lower semi-continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \geq f(x_0) - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) &lt; +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends towards &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, in the case of a metric space, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x\to x_0} f(x)\ge f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\liminf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[limit inferior]] (of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;).

The function ''f'' is called lower semi-continuous if it is lower semi-continuous at every point of its domain. A function is lower semi-continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X : ~f(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set]] for every α&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''; alternatively, a function is lower semi-continuous if and only if all of its lower [[level set|levelset]]s &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X: ~f(x)\leq\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[closed set|closed]]&lt;!-- a formulation useful in [[optimization theory|minimization theory]], for [[Weierstrauss's theorem]] on the existence of a minimum for an inf-compact function, or for the definition of a quasi-convex function by the convexity of lower level sets, etc. --&gt;. Lower level sets are also called ''[[level set|sublevel sets]]'' or ''trenches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kiwiel|first=Krzysztof C.|title=Convergence and efficiency of subgradient methods for quasiconvex minimization|journal=Mathematical Programming  (Series A)|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|issn=0025-5610|pages=1–25|volume=90|issue=1|doi=10.1007/PL00011414|year=2001|mr=1819784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

A function is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is upper and lower semi-continuous there. Therefore, semi-continuity can be used to prove continuity.

If ''f'' and ''g'' are two real-valued functions which are both upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then so is ''f'' + ''g''. If both functions are non-negative, then the product function ''fg'' will also be upper semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The same holds for functions lower semi-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puterman|first1=Martin L.|title=Markov Decision Processes Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-72782-8|pages=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Function composition|composition]] ''f''∘''g'' of upper semi-continuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' is not necessarily upper semi-continuous, but if ''f'' is also non-decreasing, then ''f''∘''g'' is upper semi-continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=James C.|title=Mathematical methods for economic theory|date=1999|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540662358|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplying a positive upper semi-continuous function with a negative number turns it into a lower semi-continuous function.

If ''C'' is a [[compact space]] (for instance a [[closed set|closed]], [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']) and ''f'' : ''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[–∞,∞) is upper semi-continuous, then ''f'' has a maximum on ''C''. The analogous statement for (–∞,∞]-valued lower semi-continuous functions and minima is also true. (See the article on the [[extreme value theorem]] for a proof.)

Suppose ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[–∞,∞] is a lower semi-continuous function for every index ''i'' in a nonempty set ''I'', and define ''f'' as pointwise [[supremum]], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sup_{i\in I}f_i(x),\qquad x\in X.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''f'' is lower semi-continuous. Even if all the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are continuous, ''f'' need not be continuous: indeed every lower semi-continuous function on a [[uniform space]] (e.g. a [[metric space]]) arises as the supremum of a sequence of continuous functions.

Likewise, the pointwise [[infimum]] of an arbitrary collection of upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous.

The [[indicator function]] of any open set is lower semicontinuous. The indicator function of a closed set is upper semicontinuous. However, in convex analysis, the term "indicator function" often refers to the [[Characteristic function (convex analysis)|characteristic function]], and the characteristic function of any ''closed'' set is lower semicontinuous, and the characteristic function of any ''open'' set is upper semicontinuous.

A function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→'''R''' is lower semicontinuous if and only if its [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] (the set of points lying on or above its [[graph of a function|graph]]) is [[Closed set|closed]].

A function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''→'''R''', for some topological space ''X'', is lower semicontinuous if and only if it is continuous with respect to the [[Scott topology]] on '''R'''.

Any upper semicontinuous function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''→'''N''' on an arbitrary topological space ''X'' is locally constant on some [[dense set|dense open subset]] of ''X''.

The maximum and minimum of finitely many upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous, and the same holds true of lower semicontinuous functions.

'''Universology''' literally means "the science of the [[universe]]." Popularizing universologic science was a life's work for 19th century intellectual [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a [[futurology|futurist]] [[utopia]]n. The word can be used synonymously with [[consilience]], a term [[Edward Osborne Wilson]] has popularized with his writings elucidating the apparent unity of all knowledge.

In recent years, Dr. [[Mamoru Mohri]], [[Japan]]'s first [[astronaut]] and Director of Japan's [[Miraikan|National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation]], has popularized and expanded on universology. For Mohri the universological worldview was an epiphany after seeing the planet from space on two missions in the 1990s, and he has become the chief proponent of universology today. "Everything in this universe is part of an uninterrupted sequence of events" Mohri has said.

In 1872 [[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Andrews]] published "The Basic Outline of Universology" which was subtitled "An introduction to the newly discovered science of the universe, its elementary principles, and the first stages of their development in the special sciences."

[[Ilya Romanovich Prigogine]] (born on January 25, 1917) was a Belgian and American physicist and chemist who was born in Russia and became a Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. In the book "Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue With Nature", which he co-wrote with [[Isabelle Stengers]], another professor at Prigogine's group in the University of Brussels, Prigogine states:

"Altogether, we tend to accept the idea propelled by Dialectical Materialism, regarding the necessity of overcoming the antithesis of humane, historical realm and the material world, perceived as atemporal. We do believe, that the setting rapprochement of these opposites will have to be enhanced, as there will be new approaches which will outline the internally evolving Universe, which we are part of." A central aspect of the ways of "outlining the internally evolving Universe", that is what Universology is all about.

When the [[APG II system]] of [[History of plant systematics|plant classification]] was published in April 2003, fifteen [[genera]] and three [[Family (biology)|families]] were placed [[incertae sedis]] in the [[angiosperms]], and were listed in a section of the appendix entitled "Taxa of uncertain position".&lt;ref name="apgii"&gt;{{citation|author=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|year=2003|title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=141|issue=4|pages=399–436|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118872219/PDFSTART|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2009, [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of [[DNA sequence]]s had revealed the [[Phylogenetic tree|relationships]] of most of these [[Taxon|taxa]], and all but three of them had been placed in some [[Clade|group]] within the angiosperms. In October 2009, APG II was superseded by the [[APG III system]].&lt;ref name="apgiii"&gt;Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2009). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III]. ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''161'''(2): 105-121.&lt;/ref&gt; In APG III, 11 of the genera listed above were placed in families, or else became families whose position within their orders was approximately or exactly known. The family Rafflesiaceae was placed in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Malpighiales]], close to [[Euphorbiaceae]] and possibly within it. ''Mitrastema'' became a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] family, Mitrastemonaceae. This family and Balanophoraceae were placed ''incertae sedis'' into orders, that is, their positions within these orders remained completely unknown. ''Metteniusa'' was found to belong to a [[Taxonomic rank|supraordinal]] group known as the [[lamiids]], which has not been satisfactorily divided into orders. ''Cynomorium'' was raised to familial status as Cynomoriaceae, and along with Apodanthaceae and ''Gumillea'', remained unplaced in APG III. Five taxa were unplaced among the angiosperms in APG III because ''[[Nicobariodendron]]'' and ''[[Petenaea]]'' were added to the list.

==''Leptaulus''==
There is no apparent reason for the inclusion of ''Leptaulus'' in the list of unplaced taxa, other than the time lag between submission and publication. In 2001, in a phylogenetic [[Research|study]] based on [[Plant morphology|morphological]] and [[DNA]] data, ''Leptaulus'' was found to belong to a group of six genera that most authors now consider to be the family [[Cardiopteridaceae]].&lt;ref name="karehed2001"&gt;Jesper Kårehed. 2001. "Multiple origin of the tropical forest tree family Icacinaceae". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''88'''(12):2259-2274.&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed in a study of [[wood]] [[Plant anatomy|anatomy]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="lens2008"&gt;Frederick Lens, Jesper Kårehed, Pieter Baas, Steven Jansen, David Rabaey, Suzy Huysmans, Thomas Hamann, and Eric Smets. 2008. "The wood anatomy of the polyphyletic Icacinaceae s.l. and their relationships within asterids". ''Taxon'' '''57'''(2):525-552.&lt;/ref&gt; The genus is placed in the Cardiopteridaceae in the [[APG III system]] of 2009.&lt;ref name=apgii/&gt; Before 2001, ''Leptaulus'' and the rest of Cardiopteridaceae had usually been placed in a broadly [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] [[Icacinaceae]], which turned out to be [[polyphyletic]].

Some botanists do not recognize Cardiopteridaceae as a family of six genera. Instead, they [[Segregate (taxonomy)|segregate]] ''[[Cardiopteris]]'' into a [[Monotypic taxon|monogeneric]] Cardiopteridaceae [[sensu stricto]] and place the other five genera in the family Leptaulaceae.&lt;ref name="utteridgeleptaulaceae"&gt;Timothy M.A. Utteridge and Richard K. Brummitt. 2007. "Leptaulaceae" pages 191-192. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. ''Flowering Plant Families of the World''. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[monophyly]] of Leptaulaceae has never been tested with molecular data.

==''Pottingeria''==
{{main|Pottingeria}}
It had long been thought, at least by some, that the small [[Southeast Asia]]n tree ''Pottingeria'' might belong in the order [[Celastrales]].&lt;ref name="airy-shaw1973"&gt;Herbert K. Airy-Shaw, David F. Cutler, and Siwert Nilsson. 1973. "''Pottingeria'', its taxonomic position, anatomy, and palynology". ''Kew Bulletin'' '''28'''(1):97-104.&lt;/ref&gt; In a phylogenetic study of that order in 2006, ''Pottingeria'' was found to be a member of the order, but not of any of its families. It was in an unresolved [[Polytomy|pentatomy]] consisting of [[Parnassiaceae]], ''[[Pottingeria]]'', ''[[Mortonia (plant)|Mortonia]]'', the pair (''[[Quetzalia]]'' + ''[[Zinowiewia]]''), and the other genera of [[Celastraceae]].&lt;ref name="zhang2006"&gt;{{citation | author = Li-Bing Zhang and Mark P. Simmons | year = 2006 | title = Phylogeny and delimitation of the Celastrales inferred from nuclear and plastid genes | journal = Systematic Botany | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 122–137 | doi = 10.1600/036364406775971778}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the APG III system was published in October 2009, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group expanded Celastraceae to include all members of the pentatomy mentioned above.&lt;ref name="celastrales"&gt;Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/Celastralesweb.html#Celastrales Celastrales] at [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html Angiosperm Phylogeny]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dipentodon''==
''Dipentodon'' has one species ''Dipentodon sinicus''.&lt;ref name="ma2008"&gt;Jinshuang Ma and Bruce Bartholomew. 2008. "Dipentodontaceae" pages 494-495. In: Zhengyi Wu, Peter H. Raven, and Deyuan Hong (editors). ''Flora of China'' volume 11. Science Press: Beijing, China; Missouri Botanical Garden Press: St. Louis, Missouri, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to southern [[China]], [[Burma]], and northern [[India]].&lt;ref name="heywood2007"&gt;Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. ''Flowering Plant Families of the World''. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). {{ISBN|978-1-55407-206-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of the order [[Huerteales]], it was shown that ''[[Dipentodon]]'' and ''[[Perrottetia]]'' belong together as the two genera of the family [[Dipentodontaceae]].&lt;ref name="worberg2009"&gt;Andreas Worberg, Mac H. Alford, Dietmar Quandt, and Thomas Borsch. 2009. "Huerteales sister to Brassicales plus Malvales, and newly circumscribed to include ''Dipentodon, Gerrardina, Huertea, Perrottetia,'' and ''Tapiscia''". ''Taxon'' '''58'''(2):468-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia''==
In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of [[Malpighiales]], Kenneth Wurdack and Charles Davis sampled five genera and one family that had been unplaced in APG II. They placed some of these for the first time and confirmed the previous placement of others with strong [[Resampling (statistics)|statistical support]].&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"&gt;{{citation|author=Kenneth J. Wurdack and Charles C. Davis|year=2009|title=Malpighiales phylogenetics: Gaining ground on one of the most recalcitrant clades in the angiosperm tree of life|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=96|issue=8|pages=1551–1570| doi = 10.3732/ajb.0800207|pmid=21628300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], they included four genera from [[Saxifragales]]. These were ''[[Daphniphyllum]], [[Medusandra]], [[Soyauxia]]'', and ''[[Peridiscus]]''. In their phylogeny, ''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia'' formed a strongly supported [[clade]] with ''Peridiscus'', a member of the family [[Peridiscaceae]], the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clade in Saxifragales. Wurdack and Davis recommended that ''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia'' both be transferred to Peridiscaceae. Thus the monogeneric family Medusandraceae is subsumed into Peridiscaceae. ''Soyauxia'' had been found to be close to ''Peridiscus'' in another study two years before.&lt;ref name="soltis2007"&gt;Douglas E. Soltis, Joshua W. Clayton, Charles C. Davis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Martin Cheek, Vincent Savolainen, André M. Amorim, and Pamela S. Soltis. 2007. "Monophyly and relationships of the enigmatic family Peridiscaceae". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(1):65-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Wurdack and Davis also found that the family Rafflesiaceae and the genera ''[[Aneulophus]]'', ''[[Centroplacus]]'', and ''[[Trichostephanus]]'' belong in the order Malpighiales.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;

==''Aneulophus''==
''Aneulophus'' consists of two species of [[woody plant]]s from [[tropical]] [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="mabberley2008"&gt;David J. Mabberley. 2008. ''Mabberley's Plant-Book'' third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. {{ISBN|978-0-521-82071-4}} (see ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; Wurdack and Davis found the traditional placement of ''Aneulophus'' in [[Erythroxylaceae]] to be correct.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt; Its position within the family remains uncertain.

Erythroxylaceae is a family of four genera. ''[[Erythroxylum]]'' has about 230 species. ''[[Nectaropetalum]]'' has eight species and ''[[Pinacopodium]]'' has two. No one has yet produced a molecular phylogeny of the family.

==''Centroplacus''==
''Centroplacus'' has a single species, ''Centroplacus glaucinus'', a tree from West Africa. It was found to be close to ''[[Bhesa]]'', a genus that had only recently been removed from Celastrales.&lt;ref name="zhang2006"/&gt; ''Bhesa'' was grouped with ''Centroplacus'' to become the second genus in Centroplacaceae.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt; ''Bhesa'' consists of five species of trees from [[India]] and [[Malesia]].

==''Trichostephanus''==
''Trichostephanus'' has two species, both in tropical West Africa. It had usually been assigned to [[Achariaceae]], but it was found to be deeply embedded in [[Samydaceae]].&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alford2007"&gt;Mac H. Alford. 2007. [http://www.tolweb.org/Samydaceae/68361 Samydaceae]. Version 6 February 2007. At [http://www.tolweb.org The Tree of Life Project].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] do not recognize Samydaceae as a separate family from [[Salicaceae]].

==Rafflesiaceae==
{{see also|Rafflesiaceae}}
Several genera have been removed from Rafflesiaceae, so that it now consists of only three genera: ''[[Sapria]]'', ''[[Rhizanthes]]'', and ''[[Rafflesia]]''. All of these are [[Parasitic plant|holoparasites]] and, as discussed below, finding their relationships by molecular phylogenetics has presented special challenges. ''Rafflesia'' and its relatives were the subject of several papers from 2004 to 2009, and as the world's largest flower, ''Rafflesia'' has attracted special interest. In 2009, Wurdack and Davis confirmed earlier work in which it was found that Rafflesiaceae is nested within [[Euphorbiaceae]] [[sensu stricto]], a circumscription of Euphorbiaceae that excludes [[Phyllanthaceae]], [[Picrodendraceae]], [[Putranjivaceae]], [[Pandaceae]], and a few other very small groups that had been included in it until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="davis2007"&gt;Charles C. Davis, Maribeth Latvis, Daniel L. Nickrent, Kenneth J. Wurdack, and David A. Baum. 2007. "Floral Gigantism in Rafflesiaceae". ''Science'' '''315'''(5820):1812.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve Rafflesiaceae, Wurdack and Davis split Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto into Euphorbiaceae [[sensu strictissimo]] and [[Peraceae]], a new family comprising [[Pera (genus)|''Pera'']] and four other genera.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;

==Parasites==
Four of the unplaced genera, and all three of the unplaced families of APG II consist of [[Chlorophyll|achlorophyllous]] [[Parasitic plant|holoparasites]]. In these, the [[chloroplast]] [[gene]]s that are usually used in phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have become nonfunctional [[pseudogene]]s. If these [[Mutation rate|evolve rapidly]], they may be saturated with repeated [[mutation]]s at the same site and consequently not be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction.

The relationships of some parasitic taxa have been elucidated in studies of [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial]] DNA sequences. But these sequences sometimes produce [[Artifact (error)|artifactual]] [[topologies]] in the [[phylogenetic tree]], because [[horizontal gene transfer]] often occurs between parasites and their [[Host (biology)|hosts]].&lt;ref name="nickrent2004"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent, Albert Blarer, Yin-Long Qiu, Romina Vidal-Russell, and Frank E. Anderson. 2004. "Phylogenetic inference in Rafflesiales: the influence of rate heterogeneity and horizontal gene transfer". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''4''':40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bdallophyton'' and ''Cytinus''==
{{main|Cytinaceae}}
The parasitic genera ''Bdallophyton'' and ''Cytinus'' have been found to be closely related and have been placed together as the family [[Cytinaceae]]. On the basis of mitochondrial DNA, Cytinaceae has been placed in [[Malvales]], as [[Cladistics#Subtrees are clades|sister]] to [[Muntingiaceae]].&lt;ref name="nickrent2007"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent. 2007. "Cytinaceae are sister to Muntingiaceae (Malvales)". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(4):1129-1135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mitrastemon''==
The parasitic family Mitrastemonaceae has one genus, known either as ''Mitrastemon'' or ''Mitrastema''. The genus name and the corresponding family name have been a source of much confusion.&lt;ref name="ppc"&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Mitrastemonaceae/index.html Mitrastemonaceae] at [http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/index.html Parasitic Plant Connection website]&lt;/ref&gt; A phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes places ''Mitrastemon'' in the order [[Ericales]], but this result had only 76% [[maximum likelihood]] [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] support.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"&gt;Todd J. Barkman, Joel R. McNeal, Seok-Hong Lim, Gwen Coat, Henrietta B. Croom, Nelson D. Young, and Claude W. de Pamphilis. 2007. "Mitochondrial DNA suggests at least 11 origins of parasitism in angiosperms and reveals genomic chimerism in parasitic plants". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''7''':248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hoplestigma''==
''Hoplestigma'' consists of two species of [[Africa]]n trees, notable for their large leaves, up to 55&amp;nbsp;cm long and 25&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name="brummitt2007"&gt;Richard K. Brummitt and Martin R. Cheek. 2007. "Hoplestigmataceae" page 167. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. ''Flowering Plant Families of the World''. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually placed by itself in the family Hoplestigmataceae which is thought to be related to [[Boraginaceae]].&lt;ref name="nowicke1989"&gt;Joan W. Nowicke and James S. Miller. 1989. "Pollen morphology and the relationships of Hoplestigmataceae". ''Taxon'' '''38'''(1):12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a phylogeny of Boraginaceae was [[Academic publishing|published]] in a [[scientific journal]] called ''[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]]''.&lt;ref name=weigend2014&gt;Maximilian Weigend, Federico Luebert, Marc Gottschling, Thomas L.P. Couvreur, Hartmut H. Hilger and James S. Miller. 2014. "From capsules to nutlets — phylogenetic relationships in the Boraginales". ''Cladistics'' '''30'''(5):508-518. {{doi|10.1111/cla.12061}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the [[DNA sequence]]s of selected [[gene]]s, the authors of that [[Research|study]] showed that ''Hoplestigma'' is related to members of Boraginaceae [[subfamily]] [[Cordioideae]], and they recommended that ''Hoplestigma'' be placed in that subfamily. Other authors have suggested that, while ''Hoplestigma'' is the [[Sister taxon|closest relative]] of Cordioideae, it should perhaps not be placed within it.&lt;ref name="apweb"&gt;Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards), Missouri Botanical Garden. [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html Angiosperm Phylogeny].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Metteniusa''==
''Metteniusa'' consists of seven species of trees in [[Central America]] and northwestern [[South America]]. Ever since [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten|Hermann Karsten]] proposed the name Metteniusaceae in 1859, some authors have placed ''Metteniusa'' by itself, in that family.&lt;ref name="lozano1988"&gt;Gustavo Lozano-Contreras and Nubia B. de Lozano. 1988. "Metteniusaceae". Monograph 11. In: Polidoro Pinto and Gustavo Lozano-Contreras. (editors). "Flora de Colombia". Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia: Bogota, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors, however, placed it in [[Icacinaceae]] until that family was shown to be polyphyletic in 2001.&lt;ref name="karehed2001"/&gt;

In 2007, in a comparison of DNA sequences for three genes, it was found that ''Metteniusa'' is one of the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clades of the [[lamiids]]. The authors recommended that the family Metteniusaceae be recognized.&lt;ref name="gonzalez2007"&gt;Favio Gonzalez, Julio Betancur, Olivier Maurin, John V. Freudenstein, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. "Metteniusaceae: an early-diverging family in the lamiid clade". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(3):795-800.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is yet known about relationships among the groups of basal lamiids. The [[Clade|groups]] in this [[polytomy]] include the order [[Garryales]], the families [[Icacinaceae]], [[Oncothecaceae]], and [[Metteniusaceae]], as well as some unplaced genera, including ''[[Apodytes]]'', ''[[Emmotum]]'', and ''[[Cassinopsis]]''.&lt;ref name="apweb"/&gt;

No phylogenetic study has focused on the lamiids, but phylogenies have been inferred for the [[asterids]], a group composed of [[Cornales]], [[Ericales]], the [[lamiids]], and the [[campanulids]].&lt;ref name="albach2001"&gt;Dirk C. Albach, Pamela S. Soltis, Douglas E. Soltis, and Richard G. Olmstead. 2001. "Phylogenetic analysis of Asterids based on sequences of four genes". ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' '''88'''(2):163-212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bremer2002"&gt;Birgitta Bremer, Kåre Bremer, Nahid Heidari, Per Erixon, Richard G. Olmstead, Arne A. Anderberg, Mari Kallersjö, and Edit Barkhordarian. 2002. "Phylogenetics of Asterids based on 3 coding and 3 non-coding chloroplast DNA markers and the utility of non-coding DNA at higher taxonomic levels". ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''24'''(2):274-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balanophoraceae==
Balanophoraceae is a family of holoparasites with 44 species in 17 genera.&lt;ref name="apweb"/&gt; For a long time, ''Cynomorium'' was usually included in this family, but it is now known to be unrelated.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"/&gt; In 2005, Balanophoraceae was shown to be in the order [[Santalales]], but its position within that order has not been determined.&lt;ref name="nickrent2005"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent, Joshua P. Der, and Frank E. Anderson. 2005. "Discovery of the photosynthetic relatives of the "Maltese Mushroom" Cynomorium". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''5''':38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two researchers in [[Taiwan]] announced on the internet in 2009 that they have results supporting the placement of Balanophoraceae in Santalales.&lt;ref name="su&amp;hu"&gt;Huei-Jiun Su and Jer-Ming Hu. "The phylogenetic relationships of Balanophoraceae and related Santalales inferred from floral B homeotic genes and nuclear 18S rDNA sequences". no date. no publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; They have yet to publish anything in a [[scientific journal]].

==''Cynomorium''==
Many names have been published in ''[[Cynomorium]]'',&lt;ref name="ipnicynomorium"&gt;[http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advPlantNameSearch.do;jsessionid=C0D8F049F38DCDCD83A51C4B89389301?find_family=&amp;find_genus=Cynomorium&amp;find_species=&amp;find_infrafamily=&amp;find_infragenus=&amp;find_infraspecies=&amp;find_authorAbbrev=&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=on&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=off&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=on&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=off&amp;find_publicationTitle=&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=on&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=false&amp;find_isGCIRecord=on&amp;find_isGCIRecord=false&amp;find_isIKRecord=on&amp;find_isIKRecord=false&amp;find_rankToReturn=all&amp;output_format=normal&amp;find_sortByFamily=on&amp;find_sortByFamily=off&amp;query_type=by_query&amp;back_page=plantsearch Cynomorium at International Plant Names Index]&lt;/ref&gt; but there are probably only [[Cynomorium coccineum|two species]].&lt;ref name="ppccynomorium"&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Cynomoriaceae/index.html Cynomorium] At: [http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/ListParasites.html List of Genera]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not closely related to anything else, so it is placed in the monogeneric family Cynomoriaceae.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"/&gt;

Attempts to find its closest relatives have demonstrated with special clarity that molecular phylogenetics is not a sure-fire, problem-free method of determining [[Plant systematics|systematic]] relationships. One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order.&lt;ref name="nickrent2005"/&gt; Doubts have been expressed about the results of this study. Another study placed ''Cynomorium'' in [[Rosales]] based on analysis of the two [[inverted repeat|invert repeat]] regions of the chloroplast [[genome]], which evolve at one fifth the [[Mutation rate|rate]] of the two [[single copy regions]].&lt;ref name="zhang2009"&gt;Zhi-Hong Zhang, Chun-Qi Li, and Jianhua Li. 2009. "Phylogenetic placement of ''Cynomorium'' in Rosales inferred from sequences of the invert repeat region of the chloroplast genome". ''Journal of Systematics and Evolution'' '''47'''(4):297-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gumillea''==
''Gumillea'' has a single species, ''Gumillea auriculata'',&lt;ref name="engler1930"&gt;H.G. Adolf Engler. 1930. "Cunoniaceae" pages 229-262. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl Prantl (editors). ''Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien'' volume 18a. Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; and is known from only one [[Biological specimen|specimen]] which was collected in the late 18th century in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="gentry1996"&gt;Alwyn H. Gentry. 1996. ''A Field Guide to Woody Plants of Northwest South America''. University of Chicago Press Edition (1996). The University of Chicago Press. Chicago, IL, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by [[Hipólito Ruiz López]] and [[José Antonio Pavón Jiménez]].&lt;ref name="ruiz1789"&gt;Hipólito Ruiz-López and José Antonio Pavón y Jiménez. 1789-1802. ''[http://www.botanicus.org/title/b12851358 Flora Peruviana et Chilensis]''. [http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753003431746 Plate CCXLV] and [http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753003431720 volume 3, page 23]. Typis Gabrielis de Sancha: Madrid, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bentham]] and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] placed it in [[Cunoniaceae]],&lt;ref name="bentham1865"&gt;George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker. 1865. ''Genera Plantarum'' volume 1, part 2, page 651. Lovell Reeve &amp; Co.; Williams and Norgate: London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;  and this treatment was followed by [[Adolf Engler]] and most others.&lt;ref name="engler1930"/&gt; The last comprehensive treatment of Cunoniaceae, however, excludes it from the family.&lt;ref name="bradford2004"&gt;Jason C. Bradford, Helen C. Fortune-Hopkins, and Richard W. Barnes. 2004. "Cunoniaceae". pages 91-111. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). ''The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants'' volume VI. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Armen Takhtajan]] placed ''Gumillea'' in [[Simaroubaceae]].&lt;ref name="takhtajan2009"&gt;Armen L. Takhtajan (Takhtadzhian). ''Flowering Plants'' second edition (2009). Springer Science+Business Media. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9608-2}}. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9609-9}} {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4020-9609-9}} (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 article on Simaroubaceae contains a list of the genera in the family. ''Gumillea'' is not on that list, but the authors do not provide a list or section on excluded genera.&lt;ref name="clayton2007"&gt;Joshua W. Clayton, Edwino S. Fernando, Pamela S. Soltis, and Douglas E. Soltis. 2007. "Molecular phylogeny of the tree-of-heaven family (Simaroubaceae) based on chloroplast and nuclear markers". ''International Journal of Plant Sciences'' '''168'''(9):1325-1339.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gumillea'' has also been called a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Picramnia]]'',&lt;ref name="mabberley2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brako1993"&gt;Lois Brako and James L. Zarucchi. 1993. "Catalogue of the flowering plants and gymnosperms of Peru". ''Monographs in Systematic Botany from the Missouri Botanical Garden''. monograph number 45.&lt;/ref&gt; but the ultimate source of this information is obscure and it is not mentioned in either of the recent treatments of ''Picramnia''.&lt;ref name="quinn1995"&gt;Edwino S. Fernando and Christopher J. Quinn. 1995. "Picramniaceae, a new family, and a recircumscription of Simaroubaceae". ''Taxon'' '''44'''(2):177-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubitzki2007"&gt;Klaus Kubitzki. 2007. "Picramniaceae" pages 301-303. In:  Klaus Kubitski (editor). ''The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants'' volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that on their [[Lithography|plate]] for ''Gumillea'', Ruiz and Pavón showed 11 [[ovule]]s or immature [[seed]]s that had been extracted from a 2-[[Locule|locular]] [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]]. But the ovary in ''Picramnia'' has (sometimes 2), usually 3 to 4 locules and there are always two ovules in each locule.&lt;ref name="kubitzki2007"/&gt;

It might be possible to determine the affinities of ''Gumillea'' if DNA could be extracted from the existing specimen. DNA has been successfully [[DNA replication|amplified]] from specimens of similar age.&lt;ref name="andreasen2009"&gt;Katarina Andreasen, Mariette Manktelow, and Sylvain G. Razafimandimbison. 2009. "Successful DNA amplification of a more than 200-year-old herbarium specimen: recovering genetic material from the Linnean era". ''Taxon'' '''58'''(3):959-962.&lt;/ref&gt; Any material used in such research, however, will never be replaced.

==Apodanthaceae==
{{main|Apodanthaceae}}
The family Apodanthaceae comprises 22 to 30 species of [[Parasitism|endoparasitic]] [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]]. These are distributed into three genera: ''[[Pilostyles]]'', ''[[Apodanthes]]'', and ''[[Berlinianche]]''.&lt;ref name="blarer2004"&gt;Albert Blarer, Daniel L. Nickrent, and Peter K. Endress. 2004. "Comparative floral structure and systematics in Apodanthaceae (Rafflesiales)". ''Plant Systematics and Evolution'' '''245'''(1-2):119-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to determine the relationships of Apodanthaceae have produced only uncertain results and they have remained enigmatic,&lt;ref name="barkman2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppcApodanthaceae"&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Apodanthaceae/index.html Apodanthaceae] at [http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/index.html Parasitic Plant Connection website]&lt;/ref&gt; until the family was shown to be confidently placed in Cucurbitales&lt;ref name="Filipowicz-Renner"&gt;Filipowicz, N. &amp; Renner, S.S. 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
"'''''Wissenschaft des Judentums'''''" ("Jewish Studies" or "Judaic Studies" in [[German language|German]]; also "Science of Judaism") refers to a nineteenth-century movement premised on the critical investigation of [[Jew]]ish literature and culture, including [[rabbinic literature]], using scientific methods to analyze the origins of Jewish traditions.

==The ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden''==
The  first organized attempt at developing and disseminating ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' was the ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden'' (''Society for the Culture and Science of the Jews''), founded around 1819 by [[Eduard Gans]], (a pupil of [[Hegel]]), and his associates . Other members included [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Leopold Zunz]], [[Moses Moser]], and [[Michael Beer (poet)|Michael Beer]], (youngest brother of [[Meyerbeer]]). It was an attempt to provide a construct for the Jews as a ''Volk'' or people in their own right, independent of their religious traditions. As such it sought to validate their secular cultural traditions as being on an equal footing with those adduced by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and his followers for the [[German people]]. [[Immanuel Wolf]]’s  influential essay ''Über den Begriff einer Wissenschaft des Judentums'' (On the Concept of a Science of Judaism) of 1822,  has such ideas in mind. The failure of the Verein, attributable largely to the far greater attraction, amongst German Jews, of identification with German culture, was followed, significantly, by the conversion to [[Christianity]] of many of its leading figures, including Gans and Heine.

==The ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement==
[[File:Die wissenschaft des Judentums.jpg|150px|thumb|left|First edition from 1822]]Despite the lack of success of the ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden'', its principles inspired many Jewish thinkers to invest their efforts in a wider ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement, and also provoked a conservative reaction (see [[Wissenschaft des Judentums#Opposition|Opposition]]).  The historian [[Amos Elon]], in his book ''The Pity of it All'', places the movement in the context of anti-Semitic riots in Germany in 1819. The purpose, Elon writes, "was to bring ordinary Jews into the orbit of German ''[[Kultur]]'' and at the same time reinforce their Jewish identity by bridging the gulf between secular and religious education"; the movement sought to explore Judaism as "both secular civilization and religion", and thereby "help young Jews to remain Jews", even as they moved to a more secular view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr. [[Henry Abramson]], the primary aim of the proponents of the movement was to articulate a modality of Jewish identity that was consonant with nineteenth century values, and where Jews had to demonstrate that they were patriotic members of their own societies, and at the same time express their Judaism proudly.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Henry Abramson, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6zvpUK7Gi8 Who Was Philo Judaeus of Alexandria?], minutes: 49:41–50:19, speaking on the ''Wissenschaft des Judentums''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===
Proponents of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' attempted to place Jewish culture on par with [[Western culture|Western European culture]], as evinced in [[Goethe]]'s ideas of [[Bildung]], and endeavored to have "[[Jewish Studies]]" introduced into the university curriculum as a respectable area of study, freeing the field from the prevailing bias that regarded Judaism as an inferior precursor to Christianity and studied it as such.  They also developed and advocated a style of scholarship which allowed complete freedom in the interpretation of traditional texts, and which might be pursued without concerns about the practical ramifications such interpretations might have for religious observance and religious life {{Harv|Glatzer|1964}}.

[[Leopold Zunz]] (1794&amp;ndash;1886), one of the movement's leading figures, devoted much of his work to rabbinic literature. At the time, [[Christianity|Christian]] thinkers maintained that the Jews' contribution ended with the [[Bible]], and Zunz began to publish in the area of post-biblical [[rabbinic literature]]. His essays "Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur" and "Zur Geschichte und Literatur" addressed this issue. His biography of [[Rashi]] of [[Troyes]] was pivotal. When the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government forbade preaching sermons in German synagogues, on the grounds that the [[sermon]] was an exclusively Christian institution, Zunz wrote ''History of the Jewish Sermon'' in 1832. This work has been described as "the most important Jewish book published in the 19th century."  It lays down principles for the investigation of the Rabbinic exegesis ([[Midrash]]) and of the [[siddur]] (prayer-book of the synagogue).

===Attitude toward religion===
Despite the outstanding scholarship of ''Wissenschaft'' personalities such as Zunz and [[Heinrich Graetz]] (most of whom pursued their scholarly labors on their own time as ''Privatgelehrte''), the ''Wissenschaft'' movement as a whole had a tendency to present Judaism as an historical relic &lt;ref&gt;Mendes-Flohr1998 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with frequently apologetic overtones,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer 2004 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often ignored matters of contemporary relevance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zunz felt obliged to assume that Judaism had come to an end, and that it was the task of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' to provide a judicious accounting of the varied and rich contributions which Judaism had made to civilization.  In a similar spirit, Steinschneider is said to have once quipped that ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' seeks to ensure that Judaism will receive a proper burial, in which scholarship amounts to an extended obituary properly eulogizing the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendes-Flohr|1998|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, throughout most of its existence and despite certain of its most prominent practitioners, such as [[Moritz Steinschneider]], being  vocal opponents of religion, ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' was very much a religious movement—pursued largely by rabbis at Jewish seminaries who were engaged in preparing their students for rabbinical careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2004|pp=105–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a foreshadowing of the reform movement, Zunz often led services, which were accompanied by an organ, in the vernacular German, rather than Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wissenschaft''  scholars such as Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel|Zacharias Frankel]], the first head of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]], and his colleague at the seminary, historian Heinrich Graetz, considered Jewish history to be reflective of a divine revelation and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2004|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wissenschaft des Judentums was not restricted to progressive Judaism. In 1873, Israel Hildesheimer founded the neo-orthodox modern Rabbinerseminar in Berlin.  One of its most prominent scholars, [[David Zvi Hoffmann|David Hoffmann]], defended a literal reading of the Biblical ''word'' which he understood to be the exact product of divine revelation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} It was this essentially religious nature of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' that made it even more dangerous in the eyes of its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer 2004 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians even thought that a more liberal form of Judaism would attract converts, or would keep Jews from converting to Christianity, and so the government forced Zunz's synagogue to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude toward earlier scholarship===
Indeed, one detects in the writings of many Wissenschaft scholars not only an intense love of scholarship "for its own sake", but also a genuine affinity for the rabbis and scholars of old, whose works they find themselves documenting, editing, publishing, analyzing, and critiquing.  Indeed, far from disparaging or despising the Jewish religion and its many generations of rabbinical scholars, the majority of Wissenschaft practitioners are very keen to take ''ownership'' of the Jewish scholarly tradition.  They see themselves as the rightful heirs and successors to [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Rashi]] and [[Hillel the Elder]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and in those prior generations of scholars they see their own Wissenschaft spirit and likeness.

In the Wissenschaft approach to scholarship, then, the earlier generations of scholars become  "de-sanctified" and "re-humanized".  Wissenschaft scholars feel completely free to pass judgment on the intellectual  and scholarly capacities of earlier scholars, evaluating their originality, competence, and credibility, and pointing out their failures and limitations.  The Wissenschaft scholars, while respectful of their predecessors, have no patience for a concept such as ''[[yeridat ha-dorot]]''.  For them, the classical authorities are no more beyond dispute and critique than are contemporary scholars; the opinions of [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]] and [[Steinschneider]] may be presented in the same sentence without any sense of impropriety, and either one may then be debunked with the same forwardness.  No doubt this de-sanctification of the Jewish luminaries provided further grist for the opponents of the movement.

==Legacy==
Although the  ''Wissenschaft'' movement produced a vast number of scholarly publications of lasting value, and its influence still reverberates through [[Jewish Studies]] departments (and, indeed, some [[yeshivas]]) around the world, it is possible to regard the publication of the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' in 1901–1906 as the culmination and final flowering of this era in Jewish studies {{Harv|Levy|2002}}.  The choice of [[English language|English]] over [[German language|German]] as the language for this epochal work is a further sign that an era of German scholarship was drawing to a close.  In the early years of the new century the ''Wissenschaft'' culture and style of scholarship was transplanted to a certain extent to bodies such as the  ''Institute for Jewish Studies'' at [[Hebrew University]] (e.g., [[Gershom Scholem]])  and Jewish Studies departments at American universities such as [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] and [[Harvard]] (e.g., [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]]).

==Opposition==
The ''Wissenschaft'' movement drew criticism from traditional elements in the Jewish community, who regarded it as sterile at best, and at worst damaging to the religious community.  A key opposition leader was [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].  He and other traditional religious scholars representing urban and sophisticated Orthodox constituencies regarded the ''Wissenschaft'' movement as failing to meet the needs of the living Jewish community; Mendes-Flohr observes in this context that historians, by virtue of their craft, necessarily "transform traditional knowledge, draining it of its sacral power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendes-Flohr|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox orientation of ''Wissenschaft'' figures such as [[David Zvi Hoffmann]] did not spare them from Hirsch's condemnation.

==Guttmann and his ''Philosophie des Judentums''==
[[Julius Guttmann]] is best known for  ''Die Philosophie des Judentums'' (Reinhardt, 1933), translations of which are available in [[Hebrew]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], etc.  The English title is ''The Philosophy of Judaism: The History of Jewish Philosophy from Biblical Times to Franz Rosenzweig'' (New York, 1964).

Roth sees in this publication "the last product in the direct line of the authentic Judaeo-German 'Science of Judaism'" (more commonly known as Wissenschaft des Judentums).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roth|1999|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement did not utterly expire with the publication Guttman's work—its spirit living on in the work of [[G. Scholem]] and [[H.A. Wolfson]] among many others—it is certainly the case that the Wissenschaft movement in Germany had by the 1930s already ceased to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roth|1999}}.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German edition of Philosophie des Judentums ends with [[Hermann Cohen]], the primary influence on Guttman's own philosophy, while the later Hebrew edition includes [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  It is also notable that Guttman's work excludes major thinkers of the [[Kabbalistic]] school, which reflects his own attitude toward [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Werblowsky|1964|p=ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
