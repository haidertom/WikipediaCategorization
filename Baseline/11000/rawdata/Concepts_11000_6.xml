      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5985">'''Autonomation''' describes a feature of machine design to effect the principle of {{nihongo|'''jidoka'''|自働化}} used in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) and [[Lean manufacturing]]. It may be described as "intelligent automation" or "automation with a human touch".&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of automation implements some supervisory functions rather than production functions. At Toyota this usually means that if an abnormal situation arises the machine stops and the worker will stop the production line.  It is a quality control process that applies the following four principles:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222919/http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-newsletter.pl?LEAN&amp;20021209&amp;1&amp; The Essence of Jidoka], Mark Rosenthal, SME Lean Directions Newsletter, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
# Detect the abnormality.
# Stop.
# Fix or correct the immediate condition.
# Investigate the root cause and install a countermeasure.
Autonomation aims to prevent the production of defective products, eliminate [[overproduction]] and focus attention on understanding the problems and ensuring that they do not reoccur.

== Purpose and implementation ==
Autonomation is called by [[Shigeo Shingo]] pre-automation.&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; It separates workers from machines through mechanisms that detect production abnormalities (many machines in Toyota have these). He says there are twenty-three stages between purely manual and fully automated work. To be fully automated machines must be able to detect ''and'' correct their own operating problems which is currently not cost-effective. However, ninety percent of the benefits of full automation can be gained by autonomation.

The purpose of autonomation is that it makes possible the rapid or immediate address, identification and correction of mistakes that occur in a process. Autonomation relieves the worker of the need to continuously judge whether the operation of the machine is normal; their efforts are now only engaged when there is a problem alerted by the machine. As well as making the work more interesting this is a necessary step if the worker is to be asked later to supervise several machines. The first example of this at Toyota was the auto-activated loom of [[Sakichi Toyoda]] that automatically and immediately stopped the loom if the vertical or lateral threads broke or ran out.

For instance rather than waiting until the end of a production line to inspect a finished product, autonomation may be employed at early steps in the process to reduce the amount of work that is added to a defective product. A worker who is self-inspecting their own work, or source-inspecting the work produced immediately before their work station is encouraged to stop the line when a defect is found. This detection is the first step in Jidoka. A machine performing the same defect detection process is engaged in autonomation.

Once the line is stopped a supervisor or person designated to help correct problems gives immediate attention to the problem the worker or machine has discovered. To complete Jidoka, not only is the defect corrected in the product where discovered, but the process is evaluated and changed to remove the possibility of making the same mistake again. One solution to the problems can be to insert a "mistake-proofing" device somewhere in the production line. Such a device is known as [[poka-yoke]].

== Relationship with just-in-time ==
[[Taiichi Ohno]] and [[Sakichi Toyoda]], originators of the TPS and practices in the manufacturing of textiles, machinery and automobiles considered [[Just In Time (business)|JIT]] &amp; Autonomation the pillars&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; upon which TPS is built. Jeffrey Liker and David Meier&lt;ref&gt;the first paragraph of Chapter 8 in their book, ''The Toyota Way Fieldbook'', Jeffrey Liker and David Meier&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that Jidoka or "the decision to stop and fix problems as they occur rather than pushing them down the line to be resolved later" is a large part of the difference between the effectiveness of Toyota and other companies who have tried to adopt [[Lean Manufacturing]]. Autonomation, therefore can be said to be a key element in successful Lean Manufacturing implementations.

For just-in-time (JIT) systems, it is absolutely vital to produce with zero defects, or else these defects can disrupt the production process - or the orderly flow of work.

JIT and Lean Manufacturing are always searching for targets for continuous improvement in its quest for quality improvements, finding and eliminating the causes of problems so they do not continually crop up.

Jidoka involves the automatic detection of errors or defects during production. When a defect is detected the halting of the production forces immediate attention to the problem.

The halting causes slowed production but it is believed that this helps to detect a problem earlier and avoids the spread of bad practices.
(JBLL, Jun18, 2006)

== Etymology ==

The word "autonomation" 自働化, a [[loan word]] from the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]], is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[autonomous]]" and "[[automation]]" 自動化, which is written using three [[kanji]] characters: 自 "self", "動" "movement", and 化 "-ization". In the Toyota Production System, the second character is replaced with 働 "work", which is a [[Kanji#Local developments|character derived]] by adding a [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] representing "human" to the original 動.

Related concepts from the [[Toyota Production System]]:
* [[Andon (manufacturing)|Andon]]: A method of signalling a problem in order to get help immediately, typically in the form of a "andon team", to avoid halting the production line.
* [[Kaizen]]: Continuous improvement.

The '''birthday-number effect''' is the subconscious tendency of people to prefer the [[number]]s in the date of their [[birthday]] over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese [[psychologists]] Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.

Most people like themselves; the birthday is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the [[name-letter effect]], has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Number Preference Task is used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards [[prices]] when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects' birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high [[self-esteem]] liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.

== Background ==
Throughout history, societies have had [[number]]s they consider special.{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=4, back cover}}{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=3}} For example, in [[ancient Rome]] the number 7 was auspicious,{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=139}} in [[Maya civilisation]] the number 13 was sacred,{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=207}} in modern-day Japan people give three, five, or seven gifts for luck, and in China the number 8 is considered lucky and 4 is avoided whenever possible.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=4}} In Western cultures the number 13 is often considered unlucky, hence the term [[triskaidekaphobia]], fear of the number 13.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=67}}

[[Design of experiments|Controlled experiments]] with numbers date back to 1933 when the researcher Dietz asked Dutch people to name the first number to come to mind between 0 and 99.{{sfn|Dietz|1933}}{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}} The number 7 was mentioned most, as it was in various later replicas of the study in other countries.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}}{{sfn|Heywood|1972}}{{sfn|Simon|Primavera|1972}}{{efn-ua|When Kubovy and Psotka constrained the task to any number in the 20s, 27 came out as most mentioned.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}} They argued that for this type of task, participants produce answers such that they ''appear'' to comply with the request for a spontaneous response.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=294}} They speculated that the other numbers appear too obvious and that 7 is unique among the numbers from 0 to 9: it has no multiples among these numbers and neither is it a multiple of any of these numbers.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=294}} However, young children do not apply this strategy and 7 does not come out on top in children of age eight and nine.{{sfn|Wiegersma|1979|p=472}}}} The number 7 also came out on top in studies that asked people to name their favourite number.{{sfn|Saito|1999|p=532}}{{sfn|Philbrick|1976}}{{sfn|Kuloğlu|Caykoylu|Yılmaz|Akyol|2009|p=113}}{{sfn|Milikowski|Elshout|1996|p=13}} In an online poll by [[Alex Bellos]], a columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', more than 30,000 people from all over the world submitted numbers, with 7 the most popular. All numbers under 100 were submitted at least once and nearly half of the numbers under 1,000.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=5}}{{efn-ua|Odd numbers outnumbered even numbers. Bellos' explanation was that in both the East and the West odd numbers tend to have more spiritual significance than even ones.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=5}} The brain also appears to process odd and even numbers differently: measuring reaction speed researcher Hines discovered that it takes people longer to judge an odd number to be odd than an even number to be even.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=4}}{{sfn|Hines|1990|p=40}}}} [[Marketing research]]ers King and Janiszewski investigated number preference in a different way. They showed undergraduate students random numbers and asked them to say quickly whether they liked the number, disliked it, or felt neutral. The number 100 had the highest proportion of people liking it (70%) and the lowest proportion of people disliking it (5%). The numbers 1 to 20 were liked by 9% more people than the higher numbers; the numbers that are the result of rote-learned [[multiplication tables]] (i.e. 2 × 2 to 10 × 10)  were liked by 15% more people than the remaining numbers. The researchers concluded that number fluency predicts number preference: hence multiplication table numbers are preferred over [[prime number]]s.{{sfn|King|Janiszewski|2011|pp=329–330}}

The closely related field of letter-preference research dates back to the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian [[psychologist]] Nuttin reported the unexpected finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The [[name-letter effect]] has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different [[languages]], cultures and [[alphabets]], no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014}} Nuttin predicted that because the driving force behind the name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the [[self]], there would also be a birthday-number effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=383}}

== Original study  ==
In 1997, researchers Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa observed that studies repeatedly showed that Japanese people do not seek to maintain and enhance their [[self-esteem]], unlike Europeans and Americans.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=736}} Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average,{{sfn|Chambers|2008|p=878}} that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures,{{sfn|Miller |Ross |1975}} and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them,{{sfn|Taylor|Brown|1988|p=193}} studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=736–737}} In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, the opposite of what was reported by Americans.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}} All these studies involved participants being aware that their self-esteem was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}} This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead [[implicit self-esteem]].{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}}  Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Greenwald |Banaji|1995|pp=4,10–11}}{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}} The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=738}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}} The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=739}}

=== Method ===
For the letter experiment, they asked 219 Japanese undergraduate students to rate each of the 45 ''[[hiragana]]'', part of the [[Japanese writing system]], according to how much they liked it.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=738}} For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 was chosen as the upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1, if they disliked the number very much, to 6, if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthdays.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=739}}

=== Results ===
Analysis of the letter preference data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=738–739}} Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants who did not have that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference.{{efn-ua|An alternative scoring algorithm is to take the mean of all of a respondent's ratings and subtract that from his or her birthday-number rating. But as Bosson, Swann, and Pennebaker later argued, this does not control for common preference effects.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}}} The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers&lt;!--digits, or the full numbers?--&gt; in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=739–740}}

=== Explanations ===
Kitayama and Karasawa concluded that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with the hypothesis that the preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=738–740}}{{efn-ua|Previous studies had already proven that birthdays are a positively valued part of the self-concept.{{sfn|Kesebir| Oishi|2010|p=1526}} Finch and Cialdini, for example, manipulated some participants into thinking they shared their birthday with [[Rasputin]]. These people rated him more favourably than the control group.{{sfn|Finch| Cialdini| 1989|p=222}}}} Since most people like themselves,{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} most people are found to have positive feelings for these constituent parts. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

An alternative explanation for the birthday-number effect that had to be tested is [[mere exposure]]. If it were true that the numbers in one's birthday are used disproportionately in one's daily life, then the preference for numbers in one's birthday could simply be a preference for what is most frequent. Zajonc found in his 1960s and 1980s lab studies that familiarity can strongly influence preference, and coined the term "mere exposure effect".{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} But Kitayama and Karasawa argued that even if people did see numbers from their own birthday more, this would still be negligible in comparison to the overall quantity of numbers they encounter in daily life.{{efn-ua|Kitayama and Karasawa found a name-letter effect even for the high-frequency letters, which helped convince them mere exposure is not the driving force behind the two effects.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} This is in line with the argument other researchers have used to rule out mere exposure as an explanation for the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Greenwald |Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}}

Kitayama and Karasawa concluded that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for. They speculated that the reason for this masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|pp=737,741}}

== Subsequent studies ==
By 2017, Kitayama and Karasawa's original study had been cited in over 300 scientific papers.{{sfn|Google Scholar|2017}}

=== Early follow-up studies ===
The first follow-up study looked at cultural differences. Blass, Schmitt, Jones, and O'Connell used  US undergraduate students as participants to replicate the original study. In their paper presented at the [[American Psychological Association]]'s annual conference in Chicago, in August 1997, they reported the same result: a preference for birthday numbers. They did find a much stronger effect though, which according to the researchers could be due to Americans' tendency towards self-enhancement.{{sfn|Blass|Schmitt|Jones|O'Connell|1997}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Markus|1999|pp=286–287}}

The second follow-up study was done in 1998 by Kitayama and Uchida. They sought to investigate the relationship between a person's name-letter effect and his or her birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa had suspected a single driving force behind both. As they had predicted, Kitayama and Uchida found that within a person the two effects were correlated.{{sfn|Kitayama|Markus|1999|p=286}} Later studies confirmed this finding.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Tennen|2006|p=5}}

In 2000, Bosson, Swann and Pennebaker tested seven measures of implicit self-esteem, including the birthday-number task and name-letter task, and four measures of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}} They used a seven-point rating scale instead of the six-point scale Kitayama and Karasawa had used, and they only looked at the day of the birthday. On average, respondents scored their birthday number 0.73 higher than the other numbers. When the researchers retested all seven implicit self-esteem measures, the birthday-number task was one of three that produced similar results.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=636}}  From the weak or non-significant correlations between the implicit and explicit self-esteem measures they concluded that implicit and explicit self-esteem are tapping different underlying constructs.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=636}}

=== Later follow-up studies ===
Later studies investigated aspects of the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=673–674}} This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition the strength of a participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=675}}

Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts investigated how the effect held up under so-called 'threats' to the self. Earlier research by Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis had already shown that the name-letter effect is influenced by a perceived threat.{{sfn|Koole| Smeets|van Knippenberg| Dijksterhuis| 1999|p=111}} Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts first made some participants write about a personal flaw and then gave all participants the Number Preference Task and the Letter Preference Task. What they found was consistent with previous findings: people who liked themselves a lot liked the numbers in their birthday and the letters of their name even more when an aspect of their self seemed under threat. This is predicted by the theory of unconscious self-enhancement. It can not be explained by  mere exposure theory.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham| Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}

Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow looked for effects with significant years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, on a scale from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}}

Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu investigated the validity of implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang |2015|p=57}} They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants to a series of tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang|2015|p=59}} Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang|2015|p=66}} Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which [[Christmas]] is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25.{{sfn|Stieger| Krizan|2013|pp=187–188}} They concluded that cultural influences need to be taken into account if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.{{sfn|Stieger| Krizan|2013|p=190}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the birthday-number effect has been exploited to measure implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=70}} The Number Preference Task is often used in combination with the more popular Letter Preference Task, sometimes jointly called the Initials and Birthday Preference Task (IBPT).{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=70}} The most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem is the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a rating task, which involves having participants judge all the numbers under a certain threshold (typically over 31 to mask the purpose of assessing connections to dates), indicating how much they like them on a 7-point [[Likert scale|rating scale]].{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}} There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} The algorithms are typically applied to both the number of the day and of the month.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task involve both letter preference and number preference, that it be administered twice, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} The Number Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[parenting]]{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Tennen|2006|p=5}} and mental [[habits]].{{sfn|Verplanken|Friborg|Wang|Trafimow|2007|p=534}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the birthday-number effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or  birthday numbers.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p= 665}} Skeptics say that the claim that letters influence life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} Based on analysis of US field data Pelham et al. concluded that people disproportionately live in towns whose names contain numbers that match the numbers in their birthday. They looked at people who were born on 2 February, 3 March, 4 April, etc. up to 8 August, and at people who lived in towns with numbers in them, such as [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], [[Four Corners, San Diego County, California|Four Corners]], etc.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|pp=478–479}} But in his critical analysis of this study Simonsohn argued that its reliability is questionable, as it found only a small number of residents with matching numbers. Simonsohn tried to replicate the finding in different ways but without success. He found no effect of just the day of birthday on the town (e.g. the second of any month, not just February). He also found no effect of birthday number on street, address, or apartment number.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011}}

Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg investigated the influence of number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers keep track of the profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham|Carvallo | Mirenberg|2004|p=672}} Relative to participants in the control condition, participants in the birthday-association condition could at the end of the test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham|Carvallo | Mirenberg|2004|p=674}} Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers.{{sfn|Pelham| Carvallo |2015|p=692}} They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.{{sfn|Pelham| Carvallo |2015|p=706}}{{efn-ua|There is a body of research into the effects of knowing a birthday match exists. Jiang, Hoegg, Dahl and Chattopadhyay examined the role of a salesperson and a potential customer knowingly sharing a birthday in a sales context. They found such an incidental similarity can result in a higher intention to purchase. This persuasive effect stems from the need for connectedness.{{sfn|Jiang| Hoegg|Dahl |Chattopadhyay|2010|p=778}} Similarly, Burger, Messian, Patel, del Prado and Anderson investigated the impact sharing a birthday with someone has in the context of making a request. Some participants were led to believe they shared a birthday with the requester, who asked for an overnight critique of an eight-page English paper. Whereas in the control group 34% of participants complied with the request, in the birthday group 62% complied. Burger et al. wrote that this is caused by the incidental association producing fleeting feelings of attraction. Participants reacted in a heuristic fashion, acting as if they were dealing with a friend.{{sfn|Burger|Messian| Patel|del Prado|2004|pp=37–38}} An analysis of large databases of lottery number picks revealed that people disproportionately selected numbers matching their birthdays.{{sfn|Wang|Potter van Loon|van den Assem|van Dolder|2016|p=247}}}}

Coulter and Grewal investigated if the birthday-number effect could be exploited in sales and marketing. Over 200 participants of an online survey were asked about an advertisement for a pasta dinner, where the price was secretly matched to the day of the month of their birthday. For example, someone born on the 16th  of a certain month would see the price "$39.16". The researchers found that matching numbers increased price liking and purchase intention. When introducing a perceived threat to the self into the task, they found an exaggerated effect. From this they concluded that the positive affect linked to birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections, and ultimately affects their purchase intentions.{{sfn|Coulter|Grewal|2014}} Keller and Gierl sought to replicate Coulter and Grewal's study. They manipulated the prices in advertisements for pizza and a music streaming service to match the birthday (day, year) of the participants in their lab study. They did not find any disproportionate liking of matching prices, neither for the year the participant was born in or the day. Keller and Gierl concluded that there must be some prerequisites such as priming stimuli to trigger the effect, although they suggested it is possible that their participants, who all happened to have been born between 1990 and 1999, saw their birthyear as price so often in real life that it had become too common.{{sfn|Keller|Gierl|2017|pp=39–42}}

Smeets used name and birthday matching in a product-liking experiment. He made up product names for a DVD that matched both part of the participant's name and his or her birthday. For example, a participant named Mariëlle, born on 14 May, would get an ad for a DVD-player named "DVD-Ma 14" in the self-relevant condition and "DVD-Pu 30" in the control condition. He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|pp=47–49}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10037">The '''Bliss bibliographic classification''' ('''BC''') is a [[library classification]] system that was created by [[Henry E. Bliss]] (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the [[United States]], it was more commonly adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] libraries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;List of libraries using Bliss Classification. http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bclink.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.

==Origins of the system==
Henry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the [[City College of New York|City College of New York Library]] as Assistant Librarian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was a critic of [[Melvil Dewey]]'s work with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broughton|first=Vanda|date=2008|title=Henry Evelyn Bliss – the other immortal, or a prophet without honour?|url=|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|doi=10.1177/0961000607086620|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of "alternative location," in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.

Bliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, "A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Henry E.|date=August 1910|title=A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives|url=|journal=Library Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, ''Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences'' was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bchist.shtml|title=Bliss Classification Association : BC2 : History &amp; description|website=www.blissclassification.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four broad underlying policies of the BC system are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* alternative location 
* brief, concise notation 
* organizing knowledge according to academic expertise 
* subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.
Bliss deliberately avoided the use of the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric [[typewriter]].

==Adoption and change to BC2==
In 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of [[faceted classification]]. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the [[Library of Congress]] system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.

The case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers’ colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries. It has also found success in libraries outside of the United States of America, as many of these libraries do not have a history of using either the Dewey Decimal, or the Library of Congress classification system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Block_party_(Manhattan,_October_4_2008).jpg|thumb|right|A block party in [[Manhattan]]]]
A '''block party''' or '''street party''' is a [[party]] in which many members of a single [[community]] congregate, either to observe an event of some importance or simply for mutual enjoyment.  The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire [[city block]] to vehicle traffic.  Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing [[music]] and [[dance]] and activities like pony rides, inflatable slides, popcorn machines and [[barbecue]]s.

As a form of [[activism]] street parties are festive and/or artistic efforts to reclaim roadways as public space by large groups of people. They were made known in Western Europe and North America by the actions of [[Reclaim the Streets]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} a widespread "dis-organization" dedicated to reclaiming public space from automobiles and [[consumerism]].

Poland [[Orange Alternative]] staged festive protests to break the [[Communist]] [[government]]'s monopoly on public life.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the UK, street parties are mainly known as private residents' events and have a special cultural meaning. They have historically been held to commemorate major national events, such as [[VE Day]] or the Queen's jubilees, with [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]] dressing the street, and children playing in the street. An estimated 10 million people took part in street parties in 1977 for the Queen's [[Silver Jubilee]].

The tradition seems to have begun mainly in England and Wales after [[World War I]] as residents' own "peace teas" to celebrate the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/history.aspx |title=History of Street Parties |publisher=Streets Alive Ltd. |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was boosted for the [[Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton|wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]] in April 2011 with about 1 million people joining in street parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/royal-wedding-street-parties.aspx |title=Street Parties for the Royal Wedding 2011 |publisher=Streetparty.org.uk |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Diamond Jubilee]] in June 2012 about 2 million took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/queens-jubilee-street-parties.aspx |title=Street Parties for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee 2012 |publisher=Streetparty.org.uk |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now street parties are held annually and at any time for residents to meet their neighbours in a traffic-free street in a private street party. Some "street parties" are public events taking many forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12979666 |title=Royal wedding: Why so few street parties? |first=Katie |last=Fraser |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2017-06-21 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An application needs making to the local authority to close a road for a street party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrexham.gov.uk/assets/pdfs/year_of_culture/application_street_party.pdf|title=Application for Closure under Town Police Clauses Act 1847|last=Wrexham County Borough Council|first=|date=2018|website=Wrexham County Borough Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the age of the legislation, any order made by the local authority uses the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deeside.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may-races-closure-notice-v7_50b7fa4fdc.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847.

Block parties are reported as a [[World War I]] innovation originating from the East Side of [[New York City]], where an entire block was roped off and patriotic songs sung and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war.&lt;ref&gt;"Block Parties", [[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]], 16 October 1918; reviewed 2008-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiocco v. Carver, 234 NY 219 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them.

In the [[United States]], block parties usually occur on holidays such as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and [[Memorial Day]]. Some towns may also have an annual block party.

Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s, particularly within the [[hip hop culture|hip hop community]]. Block parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] was taken illegally from street lights, as referenced in the song "South Bronx" by [[KRS-One]].

Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such as a recent popular movie or "Welcome to our town" for a new family. Often block parties involve barbecues and lawn games such as [[Simon Says]], [[karaoke]], and group dancing such as the [[Electric Slide]], the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] or [[line dancing]]. In many small towns, the local fire department may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that they display for show.

[[File:President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.jpg|thumb|240px|In 2017 President [[Barack Obama]]'s relationship with his Vice President [[Joe Biden]] was described as a "''bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4631033/barack-obama-joe-biden-bromance-history/|title=This Is Why the Obama-Biden Bromance Is Surprising|website=Time|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Close Relationships}}
A '''bromance''' is a close but non-sexual relationship between two or more men.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;  It is an exceptionally tight [[affectional orientation|affectional]], [[Homosociality|homosocial]] [[male bonding]] relationship exceeding that of usual friendship,&lt;ref name ="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt; and is distinguished by a particularly high level of emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt; The emergence of the concept since the beginning of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century has been seen as reflecting a change in societal perception and interest in the theme,&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt; with an increasing openness of western society in the twenty-first century to reconsider gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Bromance'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Bro (subculture)|bro]]'' (or ''brother'') and ''romance''. [[Dave Carnie]] is credited with coining the term as editor of the skateboard magazine ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'' in the 1990s to refer specifically to the sort of relationships that develop between skaters who spent a great deal of time together.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; The term did not attain broad currency until approximately 2005&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; when the theme became more prominent in the motion picture industry.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;

==Historical==
{{Main|Romantic friendship}}
Numerous examples exist of intense [[homosocial]] friendships throughout history; such relationships were common between men and also between women. The term ''[[romantic friendship]]'' is a modern historical construct with a different [[homoerotic]] [[connotation]] and [[social context|social construction]]; it is discussed within [[Romantic friendship|its own article]].

''Bromance'' has been examined from viewpoints such as [[historiography]], [[discourse analysis]], [[social research]], and [[queer theory]] in book-length reviews.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt; The emergence of ''bromance'' as a topic over the past decade has been seen as reflecting how society has collectively changed its perception and interest in the theme.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;

Several characteristics of bromance have been cited:
* Bromance conveys a male [[homosocial]] relationship that goes much further than traditional homosocial practices.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; The increased closeness goes beyond being mere friends, to a deep bond that has been characterized as capturing the conceptual edge of "is [[gay]] / is not gay".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;
* Its emergence as a distinctive conceptual genre and theme in the movie and television industry is seen as reflective of a "broader acceptance of non-[[heteronormative]] cultural expressions as well as the prospect of a same-sex intimacy that transcends matters of sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;
* Contemporary cultural circumstances, including the struggle for and attainment of [[gay marriage]] equality, and specific elements of the depiction of bromance in movies and television separate it from [[buddy film]]s, as well as historic [[romantic friendships]], which reflect a different [[social construction]].&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strudwick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deresiewicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;

According to Chen, society has taken a collective interest in reexamination of some of the traditional constraints on male friendship, and in potentially reshaping the constructs of gender, sexuality, and intimacy.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Bromance provides "a case study of gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints in twenty-first century America as they operate in law and beyond. Those constraints in turn speak to the privilege and subordination imbued in this type of relationship, with implications for other types as well."&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; This is distinct from the connotations of ''[[romantic friendship]]'', a term of 20th&amp;nbsp;century historical scholarship that retrospectively described close [[homosocial]] relationships, which had become less common after potential physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety in the second half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Faderman"/&gt;

On the one hand, social interest in the theme has been seen as driving the film industry, which has then fed back to society at large, exploring peoples' mindsets and addressing acceptance of "other types of relationships" between people.&lt;ref name="AlbertiQR"/&gt; On the other hand, some have seen the emphasis on [[platonic love]] as a rejection of [[homoeroticism]], or as a deliberate confounding of ''homosocial'' and ''homoerotic'' relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/01/our-romance-with-the-bromance/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bromance'' has also been seen as a reflection of greater "discursive expressivity".&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt; The experiences of friendship and masculinity, perhaps due to more open parenting styles from the 1970s, reflect a trend toward more openness emotionally, with increased expressivity.&lt;ref name="Elder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacey"/&gt; According to sociologist Peter Nardi, "men are less afraid of being perceived as gay. It has become more acceptable for them to show some emotion."&lt;ref name="Bindley"/&gt; Men are marrying later, if at all, which impacts [[male bonding]].&lt;ref name="Bindley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Badoo"/&gt; According to the 2010 US Census, the average age of a man's first marriage is 28, up from 23 in 1960; men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.

==Celebrity==
A number of celebrity relationships have been popularly characterised as "''bromances''". Although ''bromance'' is a new term, this treatment of celebrity relationships is not new: The composer [[Franz Schubert]] had a very close friendship with poet [[Franz von Schober]], whose texts Schubert set to music. They were nicknamed "''Schobert''" in early 19th&amp;nbsp;century Vienna.

===Film celebrities===
[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] as the 1946-1956 ‘rock star’ comedy team [[Martin and Lewis]] set a new standard for a complex, multifaceted enactment of a ‘special’ male friendship.” Coming post-war, “the comedy of Martin and Lewis teased with a sly alternative to the model of heterosexual affirmation traditionally peddled by Hollywood, as their intense and unstable relationship showcased a panoply of emotional and erotic intensities between men. The cultural resonance of Martin and Lewis's comedy derived from the way it set in motion a more complex ‘queering of gender.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=The Handsome Man and His Monkey|first=Frank|last=Krutnik|publisher=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=Spring 1995}}Vol.23 Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; They starred in 16 films together as an inseparable unit, as well as on [[Golden Age of Television|early live television]] and in [[nightclubs]]. They had an immeasurable effect on millions of [[baby boomers]] and future comedians, (including George Clooney, whose aunt [[Rosemary Clooney]] was a guest on their show).

[[Ben Affleck]] and [[Matt Damon]] were described as "''perhaps '''the''' pioneering bromance in showbiz history''",&lt;ref name="Yaskua"/&gt; which led to a hit [[off-Broadway]] play called ''Matt and Ben''.&lt;ref name="Casablanca"/&gt; The relationship between [[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Chris Pine]], stars of the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, has been described similarly, in common with their on-screen characters' relationship.&lt;ref name="Burr"/&gt;

The close friendship between [[George Clooney]] and [[Brad Pitt]] was once suggested to be "''George's longest-lasting affair''"&lt;ref name="Synnot"&gt;{{cite news | last = Synnot| first = Siobhan| title = I'm a loser in love, admits Hollywood star George Clooney| work = The Daily Record| date = 2008-10-18|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/2008/10/17/i-m-a-loser-in-love-admits-hollywood-star-george-clooney-86908-20811800/| accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Clooney's bromantic tendencies served as the basis for an episode of the animated series ''[[American Dad!]]'' entitled "[[Tears of a Clooney]]", in which lead character [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] becomes bromantically involved with Clooney as part of an elaborate revenge plot.

=== Athletes ===
Professional [[Association football|footballers]] [[Eric Dier]] and [[Dele Alli]], who play together for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[England national football team|England]], have a close relationship that has been described as a ''bromance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Anthony|title=Tottenham stars Dele Alli and Eric Dier have hit it off both on and off the pitch - they are the Premier League's blossoming bromance|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3528764/Tottenham-stars-Dele-Alli-Eric-Dier-Premier-League-s-blossoming-bromance.html|website=Mail Online|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bristow|first1=Thomas|title=Dele Alli and Eric Dier's bromance reaches record new heights while playing the water bottle challenge|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/dele-alli-eric-diers-bromance-8989068|website=Mirror|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Olympics|2016 Olympic]] 100m finals, the friendship between Jamaican [[Usain Bolt]] and Canadian [[Andre De Grasse]] emerged, characterized and celebrated on social media as a bromance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4456975/2016-rio-olympics-usain-bolt-de-grasse-smile/|title=Usain Bolt’s Happy Face Blows Up Twitter Again|last=Calvo|first=Amanda|website=Time|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between band members===
The tight relationship both on- and off-stage between [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the late [[E Street Band]] saxophonist [[Clarence Clemons]] has often been described&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Billboard.com|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470403/clarence-clemons-mourned-by-e-street-nation|title=Clarence Clemons Mourned by E Street Nation|date=2011-06-19|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Nytimes.com|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/bromance-with-the-big-man/|title=Bromance With the Big Man|author=Timothy Egan|date=2011-06-23|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/06/29/bruce_springsteen_clarence_clemons/|title=How big was the Big Man?|author=Joan Walsh|date=2011-06-29|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the most fitting examples of ''bromance'' in Western modern music. This relationship is most notably depicted in Springsteen's song "[[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out]]", from ''[[Born to Run]]'' &amp;ndash; in which Springsteen and Clemons appear respectively under their pseudonyms Bad Scooter and Big Man. It was also described in Clemons' autobiography ''Big Man: Real Life &amp; Tall Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267058/clarence-clemons-tells-springsteen-tales-in-big-man-book&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay-straight celebrity relationships===
While the term has generally been applied to straight relationships, mixed gay-straight relationships without sexual intimacy have also been dubbed "''bromances''". Examples of well-known gay-straight bromances include [[George Michael]] and Andrew Ridgley from the band [[Wham!]], [[Ronnie Kroell]] and Ben DiChiara from the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] reality series ''[[Make Me a Supermodel (U.S. TV series)|Make Me a Supermodel]]'', in which the pair was nicknamed "Bronnie",&lt;ref name="Aterovis"/&gt; the relationship on ''[[Survivor: Gabon]]'' between Charlie Herschel and Marcus Lehman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Cultural references==
===Film===
[[Buddy film]]s have to a degree been rebranded as ''bromance'' films, although critics draw a distinction between the two, noting that a buddy film tends to be more explicitly violent and less open about its latent homosexual content.&lt;ref name="DeAngelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbone"/&gt; The intersection between buddy films and what would come to be called the bromance film was noted comedically at least as early as 1978, when ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' ran a parody ad for the football-themed buddy film ''[[Semi-Tough]]'', renamed "Semi-Sweet" and featuring an illustration of stars [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] holding hands.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt;

Prominent examples of ''[[bromantic comedy]]'' include Judd Apatow's ''[[The 40 Year Old Virgin]]'' (2005) and [[Knocked Up (film)|''Knocked Up'']] (2007), which targeted non-sexual homosocial behavior and masculinity in inventive ways,&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;Setoodeh, Ramin. "Isn't It Bromantic?" Newsweek 8 June 2009: 73. Academic OneFile. Web. 24 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]]'s ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' (2005),&lt;ref name="SanFilippo"/&gt; ''[[Zoolander]]'',&lt;ref&gt;White, Susan. (2010).

Pearson Custom Pub. p.&amp;nbsp;125-33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt; [[John Hamburg]]'s ''[[I Love You Man]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="AlbertiQR"/&gt; Todd Phillips' ''[[The Hangover]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt; and Gordon's ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="Harbidge"/&gt;

Although [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels predate what could technically be called the "''bromance era''", the portrayal of the lifelong close relationships between [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] in the novels have been characterized as bromance, as well as the depictions in the films based on them.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

The theme remains popular, with different genres looking at the concept in various ways, such as the documentary ''Best of Enemies'' &amp;ndash; about the 1960s feud between intellectuals [[Gore Vidal]] and [[William F. Buckley]].&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

===Television===
Bromance on television has also become more commonplace. It appeared early-on in the partnership of two CIA/KGB spies in the 1960s' ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/the-man-from-uncle-celebrates-the-spy-phenomenon-from-the-1960s/article25957384/|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E. celebrates the spy phenomenon from the 1960s|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1970s' buddy-cop show ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch]]'', which producer Aaron Spelling called ''TV’s first heterosexual love affair.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afternoonspecial.com/pop-culture/secrets-about-starsky-and-hutch/5/|title=25 Secrets About Starsky And Hutch You Didn't Know {{!}} AfternoonSpecial|date=2016-09-07|newspaper=AfternoonSpecial|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also point to the 1970s' ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|Odd Couple]]'',&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; about which executive producer [[Garry Marshall]] has said, "The network was concerned that we were being too gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/156746_the_odd_couple_matthew_perry_reveals_secrets_behind_cbs_modern_remake/|title='The Odd Couple': Matthew Perry Reveals Secrets Behind CBS' Modern Remake!|newspaper=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed [[Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]) and [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]] ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) on the cover, under the headline "Isn't It Bromantic?".&lt;ref&gt;That characterizaton of the House-Wilson relationship, was finally acknowledged by the characters (and their writers) on s08e19, "The C Word", and they did it by weaving the term into a typical dialogue, in a non typical situation:

After a long and difficult weekend, during which House treated Wilson through his extreme and dangerous chemo treatment of choice, Wilson awakens and starts recollecting what they went through: "Wilson: I... I seem to recall, I said some things to you...
House: You talked a lot. I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins. Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches? My leg is killing me." ''note: Thus, indirectly addmiting he sacrificed his own stash of pain killeres in order to treat Wilson''. A minute later, House supports Wilson on his way to the bathroom, and they both groan, each out of his own pain: "Wilson: I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin?
House: Everybody lies... Wilson: So, the way I felt... You feel that, what, Most of the time? Really does suck being you, doesn't it? House: At least I don't have cancer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brody Jenner]], featured on MTV's reality show ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' and the subject of bromance discussions for his relationships with castmates [[Justin Bobby]] and [[Spencer Pratt]], debuted his own series on the network, called ''[[Bromance (TV series)|Bromance]]'', on December 29, 2008. The six-episode series features Jenner selecting from amongst competitors to become part of Jenner's "entourage".&lt;ref name="Yagedaran" /&gt;

In ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', J.D. is a sensitive doctor "completely in touch with his feelings. He's not afraid of showing his best pal Turk how much he loves him."&lt;ref name="Burbach"&gt;[http://friendship.about.com/od/Types_of_Friendships/p/What-Is-Bromance.htm Burbach C]&lt;/ref&gt; In one episode, they sing, "Guy love. That’s all it is."&lt;ref name="Burbach" /&gt; The J.D. and Turk relationship truly embodies one of the best bromances ever. They always stand by each other's side and often one thinks they are more in love with each other than their significant other. ''[[The Good Guys (2010 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'' "promotes male bonding while self-consciously acknowledging its homoerotic overtones."&lt;ref&gt;Lavigne, Carlen (April 1, 2013). "Two men and a moustache: Masculinity, nostalgia and bromance in The Good Guys". ''The Journal of Popular Television,'' ''1''&amp;nbsp;(1): 69–81. Intellect Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Independent'' analyzed the BBC's ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' as a ''bromance'', and looked at bromance thematically.&lt;ref name="Strudwick" /&gt; The relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bromance has been visited elsewhere also.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelling" /&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not list any more fictional/celebrity bromances here, unless citing sources which provide a significant analysis of the concept/theme of bromance.

===Other===
The cultural concept that ''bromance'' connotes particular closeness has been taken up thematically. The concept has been visited in biology,&lt;ref name="Zielinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavelle"/&gt; as well as an experimental acrobatic video dance piece, ''Bromance'', which explores “... the intimacy of physical interaction between guys; of their ‘bromance’.”&lt;ref name="Instinct"/&gt;

The relationship between [[George W. Bush]] and former press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] as told in McClellan's book ''[[What Happened (McClellan book)|What Happened]]'' was called by one reviewer "''the tale of one long, failed bromance''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kelly | first = David | title = One Long, Failed Bromance | work = Paper Cuts | date = 2008-06-02 |publisher = New York Times |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/one-long-failed-bromance/ | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, key performance indicators, business / operational exceptions and business risks, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s.

The term was originally coined by analysts at [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/105500/105562/105562.pdf Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a [[business process]] that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management.

==Goals and benefits==
The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed [[business decision]]s, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.

==Key features==
One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing the [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems.

Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably.

Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the [[issue tracking system]]. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated [[problem solving]], where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes.

==Deployment effort==
In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions.

BAM is now considered{{who|date=January 2016}} a critical component of [[Operational Intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information.

==Processing events==
All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on [[complex event processing]] (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers.

==Examples==
A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.

Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11609">In [[mathematics]], a '''cancellative semigroup''' (also called a '''cancellation semigroup''') is a [[semigroup]] having the [[cancellation property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Clifford|Preston|1967|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In intuitive terms, the cancellation property asserts that from an [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] of the form ''a'' · ''b'' = ''a'' · ''c'', where · is a [[binary operation]], one can cancel the element ''a'' and deduce the equality ''b'' = ''c''.  In this case the element being canceled out is appearing as the left factors of {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' · ''c''}} and hence it is a case of '''left cancellation property'''.  The '''right cancellation property''' can be defined analogously.  [[Prototype|Prototypical]] examples of cancellative semigroups are the [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and the [[semigroup]] of [[positive integer]]s under [[addition]] or [[multiplication]].  Cancellative semigroups are considered to be very close to being groups because cancellability is one of the necessary conditions for a semigroup to be embeddable in a group. Moreover, every finite cancellative semigroup is a group. One of the main problems associated with the study of cancellative semigroups is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for embedding a cancellative semigroup in a group.

The origins of the study of cancellative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups, {{harv|Suschkewitsch|1928}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Preston_semigroups.html |title=Personal reminiscences of the early history of semigroups |author=[[Gordon Preston|G. B. Preston]] |year=1990 |accessdate=2009-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109045100/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Preston_semigroups.html# |archive-date=2009-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''left cancellative''' (or, is ''left cancellable'', or,  has the ''left cancellation property'') if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''ac''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S''.  If every element in ''S'' is left cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''left cancellative semigroup'''.

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''right cancellative''' (or, is ''right cancellable'', or,  has the ''right cancellation property'') if {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''ca''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S''.  If every element in ''S'' is right cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''right cancellative semigroup'''.

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  If every element in ''S'' is both left cancellative and right cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''cancellative semigroup'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id= 5926|title=Cancellative semigroup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative definitions==

It is possible to restate the characteristic property of a cancellative element in terms of a property held by the corresponding left multiplication {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''S'' → ''S''}} and right multiplication {{nowrap|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''S'' → ''S''}} maps defined by {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''b'') = ''ab''}}, {{nowrap|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''b'') = ''ba''}}. An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''left cancellative''' if and only if ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[injective]]. An element ''a'' is '''right cancellative''' if and only if ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is injective.

==Examples==

#Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a cancellative semigroup.
#The set of [[natural number|positive integer]]s under addition is a cancellative semigroup.
#The set of nonnegative integers under addition is a cancellative [[monoid]].
#The set of positive integers under multiplication is a cancellative monoid.
#A [[left zero semigroup]] is right cancellative but not left cancellative, unless it is trivial.
#A [[right zero semigroup]] is left cancellative but not right cancellative, unless it is trivial.
#A [[null semigroup]] with more than one element is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative. In such a semigroup there is no element which is either left cancellative or right cancellative.
#Let ''S'' be the semigroup of real square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order ''n'' under [[matrix multiplication]]. Let ''a'' be any element in ''S''. If ''a'' is [[nonsingular]] then ''a'' is both left cancellative and right cancellative. If ''a'' is singular then ''a'' is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative.

==Finite cancellative semigroups==

It is an elementary result in [[group theory]] that a finite cancellative semigroup is a group. Let ''S'' be a finite cancellative semigroup. Cancellativity and finiteness taken together imply that {{nowrap|1=''Sa'' = ''aS'' = ''S''}} for all ''a'' in ''S''. So given an element ''a'' in ''S'', there is an element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on ''a'',   in ''S'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ae''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''}}. Cancellativity now further implies that this ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is independent of ''a'' and that {{nowrap|1=''xe''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''S''.  Thus ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity element of ''S'' which may from now on be denoted by ''e''.   Using the  property {{nowrap|1=''Sa'' = ''S''}}   one now sees that there is ''b'' in ''S'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''e''}}.  Cancellativity can be invoked to show that ''ab'' = ''e'' also, thereby establishing that every element ''a'' in ''S'' has an inverse in ''S''. Thus ''S'' must necessarily be a group.

Furthermore, every cancellative [[epigroup]] is also a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embeddability in groups==

A [[commutative]] semigroup can be embedded in a group (i.e., is isomorphic to a subset of a group) if and only if it is cancellative. The procedure for doing this is similar to that of embedding an integral domain in a field, {{harv|Clifford|Preston|1961|p=34}}. See also [[Grothendieck group]], the universal mapping from a commutative semigroup to [[abelian group]]s that is an embedding if the semigroup is cancellative.

For the embeddability of noncommutative semigroups in groups, cancellativity is obviously a necessary condition. However, it is not sufficient: there are (noncommutative and infinite) cancellative semigroups that cannot be embedded in a group.&lt;ref&gt;A. Malcev, ''On the Immersion of an Algebraic Ring into a Field'', 
Mathematische Annalen
1937, Volume 113, Issue 1, pp 686-691&lt;/ref&gt;
To obtain a sufficient (but not necessary) condition, it may be observed that the proof of the result that a finite cancellative semigroup ''S'' is a group critically depended on the fact that ''Sa'' = ''S'' for all ''a'' in ''S''. The paper {{harv|Dubreil|1941}} generalized this idea and introduced the concept of a ''right reversible'' semigroup. A semigroup ''S'' is said to be ''right reversible'' if any two principal ideals of ''S'' intersect, that is, ''Sa'' ∩ ''Sb'' ≠  Ø  for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S''. The sufficient condition for the embeddability of semigroups in groups can now be stated as follows: ([[Ore condition|Ore's Theorem]]) Any right reversible cancellative semigroup can be embedded in a group, {{harv|Clifford|Preston|1961|p=35}}.

The first set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the embeddability of a semigroup in a group were given in {{harv|Malcev|1939}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Paul M Cohn |title=Universal Algebra |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year=1981 |pages=268–269 |isbn=90-277-1254-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though theoretically important, the conditions are countably infinite in number and no finite subset will suffice, as shown in {{harv|Malcev|1940}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=John Rhodes |date=April 1970 |title=Book Review of 'The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol I &amp; II' by A H Clifford &amp; G B Preston |journal=Bulletin of the AMS |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |postscript=.}} [http://www.ams.org/bull/1970-76-04/S0002-9904-1970-12504-6/S0002-9904-1970-12504-6.pdf] (Accessed on 11 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; A different (but also countably infinite) set of necessary and sufficient conditions were given in {{harv|Lambek|1951}}, where it was shown that a semigroup can be embedded in a group if and only if it is cancellative and satisfies a so-called "polyhedral condition". The two embedding theorems by Malcev and Lambek were later compared in {{harv|Bush|1963}}.

'''Cash America International, Inc.''' is a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], retailer which operates 859 (as of January 2015) [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]] in the United States.

==Operations==
In addition to operating pawn shops, the company also provides check-cashing services and short-term unsecured loans (commonly referred to as "[[payday loan]]s") both through its pawn shops as well as in self-standing facilities.

==History==
In 2010, it acquired Maxit Financial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9IMEJB80.htm|title=Cash America completes pawn shop acquisition.|date=October 6, 2010|work=The Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310083706/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9IMEJB80.htm |archive-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2016 First Cash International completed a merger with Cash America for $994 million to form a new merged company.  The new company will allow each store to retain its branding and joint operations will be out of the Cash America corporate location. FirstCash will now be traded under on the NYSE under FCFS.

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Complexity economics''' is the application of [[complex system|complexity science]] to the problems of [[economics]]. It sees the economy not as a system in equilibrium, but as one in motion, perpetually constructing itself anew.&lt;ref&gt;W. Brian Arthur, Complexity and the Economy, Oxford: Oxford Economic Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beinhocker"&gt;Beinhocker, Eric D. The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics. Boston, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses computational rather than mathematical analysis to explore how economic structure is formed and reformed, in continuous interaction with the adaptive behavior of the 'agents' in the economy &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0dGLEreBrM&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

The "nearly archetypal example" is an artificial [[stock market]] model created by the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; The model shows two different outcomes, one where "agents do not search much for [[Dependent and independent variables|predictors]] and there is convergence on a homogeneous rational expectations outcome" and another where "all kinds of technical trading strategies appearing and remaining and periods of [[economic bubble|bubbles]] and crashes occurring".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

Another area has studied the [[prisoner's dilemma]], such as in a network where agents play amongst their nearest neighbors or a network where the agents can make mistakes from time to time and "evolve strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In these models, the results show a system which displays "a pattern of constantly changing distributions of the strategies".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

More generally, complexity economics models are often used to study how non-intuitive results at the macro-level of a system can emerge from simple interactions at the micro level.  This avoids assumptions of the [[representative agent]] method, which attributes outcomes in collective systems as the simple sum of the rational actions of the individuals.

== Measures ==

=== Economic complexity index ===
MIT physicist [[César Hidalgo]] and Harvard economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]] introduced a spectral method to measure the complexity of a country's economy by inferring it from the structure of the network connecting countries to the products that they export. The measure combines information of a country's [[diversity index|diversity]], which is positively correlated with a country's productive knowledge, with measures of a product ubiquity (number of countries that produce or export the product).&lt;ref name="HidalgoHausmannPNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=Cesar A.|author2=Hausmann Ricardo|title=The Building Block of Economic Complexity|journal=PNAS|year=2009|issue=106(26)|pages=10570–10575|pmid=19549871|doi=10.1073/pnas.0900943106|pmc=2705545|volume=106|arxiv=0909.3890|bibcode=2009PNAS..10610570H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ComplexityAtlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hausmann &amp; Hidalgo|title=The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0615546625|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/static/pdf/atlas/AtlasOfEconomicComplexity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept, known as the [[The Product Space|"Product Space"]], has been further developed by MIT's [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity|Observatory of Economic Complexity]], and in The Atlas of Economic Complexity&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; in 2011.

==== Relevance ====

The [[economic complexity index]] (ECI) introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann&lt;ref name=HidalgoHausmannPNAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; is highly predictive of future GDP per capita growth. In Hausmann, Hidalgo et al.,&lt;ref name=ComplexityAtlas /&gt; the authors show that the List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates ability of the ECI to predict future GDP per capita growth is between 5 times and 20 times larger than the World Bank's measure of governance, the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and standard measures of human capital, such as years of schooling and cognitive ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Complexity matters|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/10/buidling-blocks-economic-growth|newspaper=The Economist|date=Oct 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diversity Training|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15452697?story_id=15452697|newspaper=The Economist|date=Feb 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metrics for country fitness and product complexity ===
[[Luciano Pietronero|Pietronero]] and collaborators have recently proposed a different approach.&lt;ref name=metricsfitness1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tacchella|first=Andrea|title=A New Metrics for Countries' Fitness and Products' Complexity|journal=Scientific Reports|date=10 October 2012|volume=2|issue=723|doi=10.1038/srep00723|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121010/srep00723/full/srep00723.html|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.723T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsfitness2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cristelli|first=Matthieu|title=Measuring the Intangibles: A Metrics for the Economic Complexity of Countries and Products|journal=PLOS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070726|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070726|display-authors=etal|volume=8|pages=e70726|pmid=23940633|pmc=3733723|bibcode=2013PLoSO...870726C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metricsflyer&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Complexity: Measuring the Intangibles. A Consumer's Guide|url=http://pilhd.phys.uniroma1.it/PILgroup_Economic_Complexity/Home_files/economic_complexity_flyer%20_v2_1.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These metrics are defined as the fixed point of non-linear iterative map. Differently from the linear algorithm giving rise to the ECI, this non-linearity is a key point to properly deal with the nested structure of the data. The authors of this alternative formula claim it has several advantages:

* Consistency with the empirical evidence from the export country-product matrix that diversification plays a crucial role in the assessment of the competitiveness of countries. The metrics for countries proposed by Pietronero is indeed extensive with respect to the number of products.
* Non-linear coupling between fitness and complexity required by the nested structure of the country-product matrix. The nested structure implies that the information on the complexity of a product must be bounded by the producers with the slowest fitness. 
* Broad and [[Pareto distribution|Pareto]]-like distribution of the metrics.
* Each iteration of the method refines information, does not change the meaning of the iterated variables and does not shrink information.

The metrics for country fitness and product complexity have been used in a report&lt;ref name=fitnessmtricsBCG&gt;{{cite web|title=National Strategy for Sweden: From Wealth to Well-being|url=http://www.bcg.se/expertise_impact/publications/publicationdetails.aspx?id=tcm:106-145990|publisher=BCG|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Boston Consulting Group]] on [[Sweden]] growth and development perspectives.

==Features==
[[W. Brian Arthur|Brian Arthur]], [[Steven N. Durlauf]], and [[David A. Lane (scientist)|David A. Lane]] describe several features of complex systems that deserve greater attention in economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Brian | last1 = Arthur | author1-link = W. Brian Arthur | first2 = Steven | last2 = Durlauf | author2-link = Steven N. Durlauf | first3 = David A | last3 = Lane | chapter = Introduction: Process and Emergence in the Economy | title = The Economy as an Evolving Complex System II | publisher = Addison-Wesley | place = Reading, Mass. | year = 1997 | chapterurl = http://www.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/ADLIntro.html | accessdate = 2008-08-26 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Dispersed interaction'''—The economy has interaction between many dispersed, heterogeneous, agents. The action of any given agent depends upon the anticipated actions of other agents and on the aggregate state of the economy.
# '''No global controller'''—Controls are provided by mechanisms of competition and coordination between agents. Economic actions are mediated by legal institutions, assigned roles, and shifting associations. No global entity controls interactions. Traditionally, a fictitious ''auctioneer'' has appeared in some mathematical analyses of general equilibrium models, although nobody claimed any descriptive accuracy for such models.  Traditionally, many mainstream models have imposed ''constraints'', such as requiring that budgets be balanced, and such constraints are avoided in complexity economics.
# '''Cross-cutting hierarchical organization'''—The economy has many levels of organization and interaction. Units at any given level behaviors, actions, strategies, products typically serve as "building blocks" for constructing units at the next higher level. The overall organization is more than hierarchical, with many sorts of tangling interactions (associations, channels of communication) across levels.
# '''Ongoing adaptation'''—Behaviors, actions, strategies, and products are revised frequently as the individual agents accumulate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiozawa | first1 = Y. | year = 2004 | title = Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifest | url = | journal = Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 5–47 | doi=10.14441/eier.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Novelty niches'''—Such niches are associated with new markets, new technologies, new behaviors, and new institutions. The very act of filling a niche may provide new niches. The result is ongoing novelty.
# '''Out-of-equilibrium dynamics'''—Because new niches, new potentials, new possibilities, are continually created, the economy functions without attaining any optimum or global equilibrium. Improvements occur regularly.

==Contemporary trends in economics==
Complexity economics has a complex relation to previous work in economics and other sciences, and to contemporary economics. Complexity-theoretic thinking to understand economic problems has been present since their [[inception]] as [[academic discipline]]s. Research has shown that no two separate micro-events are completely isolated,&lt;ref name="AFC-NA-21"&gt;[[Albert-Laszlo Barabasi]] {{cite web |title =  explaining ''(at 27:07)'' that no two events are completely isolated in the BBC Documentary |work = BBC  |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/|publisher= |page =  |accessdate=11 June 2012}} "Unfolding the science behind the idea of six degrees of separation"&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a relationship that forms a [[macroeconomic]] structure. However, the relationship is not always in one direction; there is a reciprocal influence when feedback is in operation.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.lse.ac.uk/complexity/Papers/Ch2final.pdf|title= Page 20 - Ten Principles of Complexity &amp; Enabling Infrastructures |publisher= by Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Director Complexity Research Programme, London School of Economics |accessdate=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity economics has been applied to many fields.

===Intellectual predecessors===
Complexity economics draws inspiration from [[behavioral economics]], [[Marxian economics]], [[institutional economics]]/[[evolutionary economics]], [[Austrian economics]] and the work of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Complexity and the History of Economic Thought
|last=Colander
|first=David
|date=March 2008
|accessdate=29 July 2012
|url=http://sandcat.middlebury.edu/econ/repec/mdl/ancoec/0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also draws inspiration from other fields, such as [[statistical mechanics]] in physics, and [[evolutionary biology]]. Some of the 20th century intellectual background of complexity theory in economics is examined in Alan Marshall (2002) The Unity of Nature, Imperial College Press: London. See Douma &amp; Schreuder (2017) for a non-technical introduction to Complexity Economics and a comparison with other economic theories (as applied to markets and organizations).

===Applications===
The theory of complex dynamic systems has been applied in diverse fields in economics and other decision sciences. These applications include [[capital theory]],&lt;ref name=Rosser1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J.

Saari]].&lt;ref name=Saari2001&gt;Saari, Donald G. ''Chaotic Elections: A Mathematician Looks at Voting''. American Mathematical Society (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Complexity economics has attracted the attention of historians of economics.&lt;ref name=Bausor1994&gt;Bausor, Randall. "Qualitative dynamics in economics and fluid mechanics: a comparison of recent applications", in ''Natural Images in Economic Thought: Markets Read in Tooth and Claw'' (ed. by Philip Mirowski). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ramalingam's [[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]] includes numerous applications of complexity economics that are relevant to [[aid|foreign aid]].

===Complexity economics as mainstream, but non-orthodox===
According to {{harvtxt|Colander|2000}}, {{harvtxt|Colander|Holt|Rosser|2004}}, and {{harvtxt|Davis|2008}} contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is evolving to be more "eclectic",&lt;ref name=COL2000a&gt;"Economists today are not neoclassical according to any reasonable definition of the term.

== Criticism ==
In 1995-1997 publications, ''[[Scientific American]]'' journalist John Horgan "ridiculed" the movement as being the fourth ''C'' among the "failed fads" of  "[[complexity]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]], and [[cybernetics]]".&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; In 1997, Horgan wrote that the approach had "created some potent metaphors: the [[butterfly effect]], [[fractal]]s, [[artificial life]], the [[edge of chaos]], [[self organized criticality]].  But they have not told us anything about the world that is both concrete and truly surprising, either in a negative or in a positive sense."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosser Jr | first1 = J. Barkley | year = 1999 | title = On the Complexities of Complex Economic Dynamics | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1257/jep.13.4.169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horgan | first1 = John | year = 1995 | title = From Complexity to Perplexity | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 272 | issue = 6| pages = 104–09 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0695-104| bibcode = 1995SciAm.272f.104H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John, The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age. Paperback ed, New York: Broadway Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosser "granted" Horgan "that it  is hard to identify a concrete and surprising discovery (rather than "mere metaphor") that has arisen due to the emergence of complexity analysis" in the discussion journal of the [[American Economic Association]], the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]''.&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;  Surveying economic studies based on complexity science, Rosser wrote that the findings, rather than being surprising, confirmed "already-observed facts."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Rosser wrote that there has been "little work on empirical techniques for testing dispersed&amp;nbsp;agent complexity&amp;nbsp;models."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt; Nonetheless, Rosser wrote that "there is a strain of common perspective that has been accumulating as the four C's of cybernetics, catastrophe, chaos, and complexity emerged, which may now be reaching a critical mass in terms of influencing the thinking of economists more broadly."&lt;ref name=Rosser1999/&gt;

In mathematics, a '''covering number''' is the number of spherical [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]s of a given size needed to completely cover a given space, with possible overlaps. Two related concepts are the ''packing number'', the number of disjoint balls that fit in a space, and the ''metric entropy'', the number of points that fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.

== Definition ==

Let (''M'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]], let ''K'' be a subset of ''M'', and let ''r'' be a positive [[real number]]. Let ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denote the [[Ball (mathematics)#Balls in general metric spaces|ball]] of radius ''r'' centered at ''x''. A subset ''C'' of ''M'' is an ''r-external covering'' of ''K'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \cup_{x \in C} B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, for every &lt;math&gt;y\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;x\in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq r&lt;/math&gt;.

If furthermore ''C'' is a subset of ''K'', then it is an ''r-internal covering''.

The '''external covering number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any external covering of ''K''. The '''internal covering number''', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any internal covering.

A subset ''P'' of ''K'' is a ''packing'' if &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\{B_r(x)\}_{x \in P}&lt;/math&gt; is [[pairwise disjoint]]. The '''packing number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{pack}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any packing of ''K''.

A subset ''S'' of ''K'' is ''r''-''separated'' if each pair of points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'' satisfies ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ ''r''. The '''metric entropy''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any ''r''-separated subset of ''K''.

== Examples ==
1. The metric space is the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of real numbers whose absolute value is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an external covering of &lt;math&gt;\lceil 2k/r \rceil&lt;/math&gt; intervals of length &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, covering the interval &lt;math&gt;[k,-k]&lt;/math&gt;. Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k / r)&lt;/math&gt;

2. The metric space is the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Euclidean metric]].
&lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a set of vectors whose length (norm) is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; lies in a ''d''-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then:&lt;ref name=book14&gt;{{Cite Shai Shai 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}}
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k \sqrt{d}/r)^d&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The metric space is the space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric.
The covering number &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;
is the smallest number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; 
such that, there exist &lt;math&gt;h_1,\ldots,h_k \in K&lt;/math&gt;
such that, for all &lt;math&gt;h\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the supremum distance between &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
The above bound is not relevant since the space is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional.
However, when &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set]], every covering of it has a finite sub-covering, 
so &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name=book12&gt;{{Cite Mehryar Afshin Ameet 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

== Properties ==

1. The internal and external covering numbers, the packing number, and the metric entropy are all closely related. The following chain of inequalities holds for any subset ''K'' of a metric space and any positive real number ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tao|first1=Terrance|title=Metric entropy analogues of sum set theory|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/metric-entropy-analogues-of-sum-set-theory/|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_{2 r}(K) \leq N^{\text{pack}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{int}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;

2. Each function except the internal covering number is non-increasing in ''r'' and non-decreasing in ''K''. The internal covering number is monotone in ''r'' but not necessarily in ''K''.

The following properties relate to covering numbers in the standard [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|338}}

3. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are translated by a constant vector &lt;math&gt;k_0\in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then the covering number does not change.

4. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are multiplied by a scalar &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(k\cdot K) = N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

5. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are operated by a [[Lipschitz function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with [[Lipschitz constant]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(\phi\circ K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to machine learning ==
Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric (see example 3 above).
Suppose all functions in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are bounded by a real constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, the covering number can be used to bound the [[generalization error]]
of learning functions from &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
relative to the squared loss:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|61}}

::&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Prob}\big[
\sup_{h\in K}|\text{GeneralizationError}(h)-\text{EmpiricalError}(h)|\geq \epsilon
\big]
\leq
N^{\text{int}}_r(K)\cdot 2\exp{-m\epsilon^2 \over 2M^4}
&lt;/math&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;r={\epsilon \over 8M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26899">{{condensed matter physics}}
In [[solid state physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], the '''density of states''' ('''DOS''') of a system describes the number of states per an interval of energy at each energy level available to be occupied. It is mathematically represented by a [[Probability density function|density distribution]] and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. A high 'DOS' at a specific energy level means that there are many states available for occupation. A DOS of zero means that no states can be occupied at that energy level. The DOS is usually represented by one of the symbols ''g, ρ, D, n, or N''.  

Generally, the density of the states of matter is continuous. In [[isolated system]]s however, like atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the [[Probability density function|density distribution]] is [[Discrete distribution|discrete]] like a [[spectral density]]. 

Local
variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called '''[[local density of states]]''' ('''LDOS'''). If the DOS of an undisturbed
system is zero, the LDOS can locally be non-zero due to the presence of a local potential.

==Introduction==

In quantum mechanical (QM) systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels . 

For example, the density of states of electrons at the bandedge between the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and the [[Valence and conduction bands|valence band]] in a semiconductor is shown in orange in Fig. 4 (in the subsequent section "Density of states and distribution functions"). For an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy causes more states to become available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that there are no states available for electrons to occupy within the bandgap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the bandgap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.

Depending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s, or [[phonon]]s, and can be given as a function of either energy or the [[wave vector]] ''k''. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between ''E'' and ''k'' must be known. 

In general, the topological properties of the system have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like [[neutronium]] in [[Neutron star|neutron stars]] and [[Free electron model|free electron gases in metals]] (examples of [[degenerate matter]] and a [[Fermi gas]]), have a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean topology]]. Less familiar systems, like [[Two-dimensional electron gas|two-dimensional electron gases]] (2DEG) in [[graphite]] layers and the [[quantum Hall effect]] system in [[MOSFET]] type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are [[carbon nanotubes]], the [[quantum wire]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] proceed.

==Definition==
In general the density of states, related to volume ''V'' and ''N'' countable energy levels, is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \cdot \sum _{i=1}^N \delta \left(E - E\left({\vec{k}}_i\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt; 

Using &lt;math&gt; (\Delta k)^d = \left(\frac{2\pi}{L}\right)^d &lt;/math&gt; (the smallest allowed change of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for a particle in a box of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) under the limit &lt;math&gt;L \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, one derives the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\pi)^d}} \cdot \delta \left(E - E\left(\vec{k}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of the spatial dimension of the considered system and &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; the wave vector.

Equivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function &lt;math&gt; Z_m (E)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the energy:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac {1}{V} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\mathrm{d} E}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of states with energy &lt;math&gt; E' &lt;/math&gt; (degree of degeneracy) is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; g\left(E'\right) = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} \int _{E'}^{E' + \Delta E} D(E) \mathrm{d} E = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} D\left(E'\right) \Delta E,&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.

==Symmetry==
[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|260px|First Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]
There is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.

Some condensed matter systems possess a [[symmetry]] of its [[Crystal structure|structure]] on its microscopic scale which simplifies calculations of its density of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of function are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. [[Fluid]]s, [[glass]]es or [[amorphous solid]]s are example of a symmetric system whose [[dispersion relations]] has a rotational symmetry. 

[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|150px|left|Octahedron.]]
Measurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole [[Domain of a function|domain]], most often a [[Brillouin zone]], of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or [[fundamental domain]].&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;
{{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 
|publisher=Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-486-66021-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Brillouin zone of the of a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] ''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' with full [[Octahedral symmetry#Achiral octahedral symmetry|octahedral symmetry]]. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystal structure periodic table]] shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like [[diamond]], [[silicon]] and [[platinum]] and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold [[Tetrahedral symmetry#Pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral symmetry]] of the point group ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''. The HCP structure has the 12-fold [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions#Examples|prismatic dihedral]] symmetry of the point group ''D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;''. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in [[List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups#Character tables|point group character tables]].

In general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.

In [[anisotropic]] condensed matter systems such as a [[single crystal]] of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.

==''k''-space topologies==

[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1: Spherical surface in ''k''-space for electrons in three dimensions.]]

The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Volume&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Area&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Length&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is important to note that the volume being referenced is the volume of ''k''-space; the space enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] of the system derived through a [[dispersion relation]] that relates ''E'' to ''k''. An example of a 3-dimensional ''k''-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system itself will confine the momentum of particles inside the system.

===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===
The calculation for DOS starts by counting the ''N'' allowed states at a certain ''k'' that are contained within {{nowrap|[''k'',  ''k + dk'']}} inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n, k}&lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensions at an arbitrary ''k'', with respect to ''k''. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical ''k''-spaces are expressed by
: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

for a n-dimensional ''k''-space with the topologically determined constants
: &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 2,\  c_2 = \pi,\  c_3 = \frac{4 \pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

for linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean ''k''-spaces respectively.

According to this scheme, the density of wave vector states ''N'' is, through differentiating &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''k'', expressed by
:&lt;math&gt;N_n(k) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(k)}{{\rm d}k} = n\; c_n\; k^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  N_1(k) &amp;= 2 \\
  N_2(k) &amp;= 2 \pi k \\
  N_3(k) &amp;= 4 \pi k^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength λ. The wavelength is related to ''k'' through the relationship.
: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In a quantum system the length of λ will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states ''N'' is multiplied by a factor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', where ''s'' is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then &lt;math&gt;s = 1&lt;/math&gt;. ''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.

===Density of energy states===
To finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; inside an interval &lt;math&gt;[E, E+dE]&lt;/math&gt;. The general form of DOS of a system is given as
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(E)}{{\rm d}E}&lt;/math&gt;
The scheme sketched so far ''only'' applies to ''monotonically rising'' and ''spherically symmetric'' dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express ''D'' as a function of ''E'' the [[Inverse function|inverse of the dispersion relation]] &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; has to be substituted into the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of ''k'' to get the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britneyspears.ac/physics/dos/dos.htm Sample density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_4.htm Another density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersion relations==

The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the [[electronic band structure]].
 
The [[kinetic energy]] of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the [[wave vector]] ''k'', the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] in a [[Fermi gas]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + \frac{\left(\hbar k\right)^2}{2m} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]]. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily. 

[[File:Monoatomic chain phonon dispersion.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation]]
For longitudinal [[phonon]]s in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional ''k''-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E =  2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\sin\left(\frac{ka}{2}\right)\right| &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{k_{\rm F} / m}&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator frequency, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the atoms, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; the inter-atomic force constant and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; inter-atomic spacing. For small values of &lt;math&gt;k \ll \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the dispersion relation is rather linear:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \hbar \omega_0 ka &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;k \approx \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the energy is
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\cos\left(\frac{\pi - ka}{2}\right)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

With the transformation &lt;math&gt;q = k - \pi/a &lt;/math&gt; and small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; this relation can be transformed to 
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left[1 - \left(\frac{qa}{2}\right)^2\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Isotropic dispersion relations===
The two examples mentioned here can be expressed like
:&lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + c_k k^p&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is a kind of [[dispersion relation]] because it interrelates two wave properties and it is [[isotropy|isotropic]] because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\right)^\frac{1}{p} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, the volume of n-dimensional ''k''-space containing wave vectors smaller than ''k'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E) = \frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\frac{n}{p}}\left(E - E_0\right)^\frac{n}{p}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac {d}{dE}\Omega_n(E) = \frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\frac{n}{p}} \left(E - E_0\right)^{\frac{n}{p} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Parabolic dispersion===
[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]
In the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (''p'' = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, &lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right)&lt;/math&gt;, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_k \left(E - E_0\right)}} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{c_k} \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \ .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;E &gt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;D(E) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E &lt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; drops to &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |author=Charles Kittel |page=Equation (37), p. 216 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the prefactor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', the expression for the 3D DOS is
:&lt;math&gt;N(E) = \frac {V}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{E - E_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the total volume, and &lt;math&gt;N(E-E_0)&lt;/math&gt; includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.

===Linear dispersion===
In the case of a linear relation (''p'' = 1), such as applies to [[photon]]s, [[acoustic phonon]]s, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{c_k} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{c_k^2}\left(E - E_0\right) \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{4 \pi}{c_k^3}\left(E - E_0\right)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Distribution functions==
{{main article|Kinetic theory of solids}}
The density of states plays an important role in the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. The product of the density of states and the [[Distribution function (physics)|probability distribution function]] is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties. 

[[File:Fermi-Dirac product with Density of States.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4: The {{colorbox|#5e81B5}}{{nbsp}}Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, {{colorbox|#e19c24}}{{nbsp}}density of states, and {{colorbox|#8FB131}}{{nbsp}}their product for a semiconductor. The lower green lobe depicts ''hole'' energy, and thus uses &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; as the distribution function.]]

[[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]: The Fermi–Dirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Fermion]]s are particles which obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_\mathrm{B} T}\right) + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] (also denoted as E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and called the [[Fermi level]] when ''T''=0), &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.

[[Bose–Einstein statistics]]: The Bose–Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Boson]]s are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_{\rm B} T}\right) - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

From these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the number of particles &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, [[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and [[thermal conductivity]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by &lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;D(E)&lt;/math&gt;, are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U &amp;= \int E\, f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  n &amp;= \int f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  C &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E\, f(E)\, g(E) \,{\rm d}E \\
  k &amp;= \frac{1}{d}\frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E f(E)\, g(E)\, \nu(E)\, \Lambda(E)\,{\rm d}E
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is dimensionality, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is sound velocity and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[mean free path]].

==Applications==
The density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.

===Quantization===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DOS multdim.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Density of states for electrons in bulk semiconductors (3D; in blue), quantum wells (2D; red), quantum wires (1D; green) and quantum dots (0D; black).]] --&gt;
Calculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For [[quantum wires]], the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for [[quantum dots]] the electrons become quantized to certain energies.

===Photonic crystals===
The photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic bandgap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as [[photonic crystals]]. In nanostructured media the concept of [[local density of states]] (LDOS) is often more relevant than that of DOS, as the DOS varies considerably from point to point.

==Computational calculation ==

Interesting systems are in general complex, for instance compounds, biomolecules, polymers, etc. Because of the complexity of these systems the analytical calculation of the density of states is in most of the cases impossible. Computer simulations offer a set of algorithms to evaluate the density of states with a high accuracy. One of these algorithms is called the [[Wang and Landau algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| title = Efficient, Multiple-Range Random Walk Algorithm to Calculate the Density of States
| author1=Wang, Fugao | author2=Landau, D. P.

|  volume = 86

| bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.2050W
| arxiv = cond-mat/0011174
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Wang and Landau scheme any previous knowledge of the density of states is required. One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin ''i'' is reached one updates
a histogram for the density of states, &lt;math&gt;g(i)&lt;/math&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt; g(i) \rightarrow  g(i) + f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times
(10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt; f_{n+1} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} f_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' denotes the ''n''-th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance &lt;math&gt;f_n &lt; 10^{-8} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as [[multicanonical ensemble|multicanonical simulations]] and [[parallel tempering]]. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins.&lt;ref name="ojeda"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ojeda, P. |author2=Garcia, M. |title=Electric Field-Driven Disruption of a Native beta-Sheet Protein Conformation and Generation of a Helix-Structure  |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=595–599 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.040 |pmid=20643079|bibcode = 2010BpJ....99..595O |pmc=2905109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''diagram''' is a symbolic [[Depiction|representation]] of [[information]] according to some [[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] technique. Diagrams have been used since ancient times, but became more prevalent during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178–196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, the technique uses a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] visualization which is then [[graphical projection|projected]] onto a two-dimensional surface. The word ''[[graphics|graph]]'' is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for diagram.

== Overview ==
The term "diagram" in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning: 
* ''visual information device'' : Like the term "[[illustration]]", "diagram" is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including [[graphics|graphs]], technical drawings and [[table (information)|tables]].&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt;
* ''specific kind of visual display'' : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.

In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: "diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and [[map]]s, [[line graph]]s, [[bar chart]]s, [[engineering]] [[blueprint]]s, and [[architect]]s' [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not".&lt;ref name="MA97"&gt;Michael Anderson (1997). "Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning," at ''cs.hartford.edu.'' Retrieved 21 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically "abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent".&lt;ref name= "RKL 93"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=Richard K. |year=1993 |title=Diagrammatic information: techniques for exploring its mental representation and processing |journal=Information Design Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–18 |doi=10.1075/idj.7.1.01low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with [[computer graphics]], technical illustrations, [[infographics]], maps, and [[technical drawing]]s, by showing "abstract rather than [[literal translation|literal]] representations of information".&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee E. |last=Brasseur |authorlink=Lee E. Brasseur |title=Visualizing technical information: a cultural critique |publisher=Baywood Pub |location=Amityville, N.Y |year=2003 |isbn=0-89503-240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of a diagram can be seen as:&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt;
* a ''form'' of visual [[Content format|format]]ting devices
* a ''display'' that does not show [[quantitative data]] (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information
* with ''building blocks'' such as geometrical shapes connected by [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[arrow]]s, or other visual links.
Or in Hall's (1996) words "diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning".&lt;ref name="BSH96"&gt;Bert S. Hall (1996). "The Didactic and the Elegant: Some Thoughts on Scientific and Technological Illustrations in the Middle Ages and Renaissance". in: B. Braigie (ed.) ''Picturing knowledge: historical and philosophical problems concerning the use of art in science''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; These simplified figures are often based on a set of rules. The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of "elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity".&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt; Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is "the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Jan V. |title=Using charts and graphs: 1000 ideas for visual persuasion |publisher=Bowker |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-8352-1894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main diagram types ==
There are at least the following types of diagrams:
*[[Chart]]-like diagrams, which take a collection of items and relationships between them, and express them by giving each item a 2D position, while the relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items; examples of such techniques:

{|style="width:100%"
|style="vertical-align:top; width:25px;"|
|style="vertical-align:top;"|
&lt;gallery perrow="5" widths="80" heights="80"&gt;

File:LampFlowchart.svg|[[flowchart]]
File:Set intersection.svg|[[Venn diagram]]
File:Alphagraphen.png|[[existential graph]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

*[[Chart|Graph]]-based diagrams; these display a relationship between two variables that take either [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|discrete]]  or a [[continuous function|continuous]] ranges of values; examples:

{|style="width:100%"

Many of these types of diagrams are commonly generated using diagramming software such as [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] and [[Gliffy]]. Thousands of diagram techniques exist.  Some more examples follow.

Diagrams may also be classified according to use or purpose, for example, explanatory and/or [[how to]] diagrams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7568">The Domar Serfdom Model is a mid-to-late 20th century model that develops a hypothesis concerning the causes of agricultural slavery or serfdom in historical societies. [[Evsey Domar]] first presented this model in his 1970 paper, “ The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis” published in the [[The Economic History Review|Economic History Review]]. The Domar Serfdom Model revives a hypothesis originally suggested by Russian Historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], who looks at the causes of slavery through the lens of the Russian experience in the 16th and 17th centuries. In his revisiting of the hypothesis, Domar aims to give it wider applicability while focusing more on an analysis that yields an economic model as an explanation of the causes of slavery.

== Assumptions and Hypothesis ==

In his model of serfdom, Domar assumes the following:

* Land and labor are the only factors of production (no capital or management required) (Domar, 2)	 
* Land is of uniform quality and location is a non-factor 
* Constant returns in labor (marginal product of labor is constant, and nearly equal to the average product of labor)

In addition, Domar asserts that there are 3 elements of agricultural structure relevant in his model: 
	
# Abundant free land
# Abundant free labor (free peasants)
# Large Scale Agriculture (non-working landowners)

Domar claims that any 2 of these 3 elements can exist cohesively, but never can all 3 elements exist simultaneously in any particular situation.  Dependent on which elements exist cohesively, one will see differing types of societies.  (Domar, 5)
	The Domar Serfdom Model characteristics bond labor to being a product of human choice and creation. Taking Q=F(Land, Labor), stated in words as production being a function of land and labor, and under the assumptions that production requires only land and labor,  production demonstrates constant returns to scale, and there is an abundance of free land, than free-wage labor will not exist.
Additionally, production units will require bond labor. It is this attribution of bond labor resulting from human choice that separates Domar’s model from models that attribute slavery to a product of nature, such as [[Staples thesis|Staple’s Thesis]].  (Domar, 5)

== Historical Application ==

Domar concentrates the testing of his model on historical analysis of serfdom and slavery in Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Western Europe, and the United States.  
	Domar’s analysis of Russia looks at pre-1550, where Russian peasants were free men, and 100 years later, where Russian peasants were serfs. (Domar, 8) Domar states that the relevant factors contributing to this change in classification were the number of servants required by the military and the population density. (Domar, 8) In the second half of the 15th century, the Russian government began distributing land, depopulating the central areas of the country. By the start of the 17th century, a high land/labor ratio was present in addition to the governmental need to create a large class of servants, which caused a large increase in serfdom levels in Russia into the 19th century. (Domar, 11)
	In Poland-Lithuania, relevant factors leading to the increase in slavery and serfdom started in the 14th century with a conquering of Ukrainian land, leading to a much higher land/labor ratio in the newly expanded region. (Domar, 11-12) In addition, the immigration out of the central areas and into the more peripheral areas of the state led to a more homogenous land/labor ratio throughout the entire state. (Domar, 12)
	In his analysis of serfdom in Western Europe, Domar suggests that depopulation of the late Rome Empire created a large increase in the land/labor ratio, creating a situation in which the development of serfdom rose as a subsequent effect of an increasing land/labor ratio due to a decreasing population.  (Domar, 13) The end of the 13th century in Western Europe is met by a sharp decline in serfdom, which Domar attributes to overpopulation, a large surplus of labor, and thus a very low land/labor ratio. 
	Additionally, this economic model plays an incredibly important role in the analysis of the causes of slavery in the Colonial American South. Domar states that the American South demonstrated abundant free land and large scale agriculture, but not abundant free labor. In contrast, the American North demonstrated abundant free land and abundant free labor, but not large scale agriculture. The American South during the colonial period was characterized by vast amounts of fertile land that was largely uninhabited previous to colonization, and sparsely populated during colonization. (Domar, 16) Domar attributes the importation of slaves to the American South as an economic need for labor due to such a high land/labor ratio. Domar qualifies the difference in popularity of slavery in the American South relative to the American North to political and social objections, as well as a potential for increased adaptability of slaves to the warmer climate, or the increased productivity that goes along with longer and more fruitful seasons in the south due to the temperature.  (Domar, 16)

== Critiques ==

The Domar Serfdom Model has been met with criticism since its publishing in ''The Journal of Economic History'' in 1970.  In 2009, Professor Jean Jacques Rosa authored a paper titled, “The Causes of Serfdom: A Hypothesis Revisited” in which Rosa argues that serfdom and slavery are mutually exclusive events. Where Domar argues that labor scarcity is a necessary but exogenous political factor needed for serfdom, Rosa challenges his view by showing that “in an agrarian subsistence economy the complementary conditions of serfdom are (a) oligopsony power in labor demand, sustained by (b) an oligopolistic supply of violence by large land owners.”  In addition, Professor Erik Green of Lund University argues that Domar’s model fails in explaining the origins of slavery in Cape Colony, South Africa, where the consensus is that slavery evolved as an urban phenomenon, which would call into question the land/labor ratio Domar uses to explain the causes of slavery and serfdom. Moreover, Professor Jonathon Cunning of Hunter University authored a paper titled “On the Causes of Slavery or Serfdom and the Roads to Agrarian Capitalism: Domar’s Hypothesis Revisited” In his paper, Cunning offers a “simple general equilibrium formalization of Domar’s famous hypothesis on the causes of slavery or serfdom that emphasizes the interactions between factor endowments, the nature of the production technologies, and the initial distribution of property rights over land.” Cunning’s paper is viewed more so as an expansion upon Domar’s model rather than a direct challenge to his hypothesis.

One ear receives an isolated third-[[formant]] transition that sounds like a nonspeech chirp. At the same time the other ear receives a base [[syllable]]. This base syllable consists of the first two [[formants]], complete with formant transitions, and the third formant without a transition. Normally, there would be peripheral [[Auditory masking|masking]] in such a [[Sound localization|binaural]] listening task but this does not occur. Instead, the listener's percept is duplex, that is, the completed syllable is perceived and the nonspeech chirp is heard at the same time. This is interpreted as  being due to the existence of a special speech module.

The phenomenon was discovered in 1974 by Timothy C. Rand at the [[Haskins Laboratories]] associated with [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Ellen Jane Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; born March 25, 1947) is a professor of [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]];  in 1981, she became the first woman ever to be tenured in psychology at Harvard.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilts|first1=Philip J|date=23 September 1997|title=Scientist At Work: Ellen Langer; A Scholar of the Absent Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/23/science/scientist-at-work-ellen-j-langer-a-scholar-of-the-absent-mind.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMindfulnessChronicles&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Cara|date=2010|title=The Mindfulness Chronicles|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/09/the-mindfulness-chronicles|newspaper=[[Harvard Magazine]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langer studies the [[illusion of control]], decision-making, [[aging]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] theory.&lt;ref name=TheMindfulnessChronicles/&gt; Her most influential work is ''Counterclockwise'', published in 2009, which answers the questions of aging from her extensive research, and increased interest in the particulars of aging across the nation.

== Early life and education ==
Langer was born in [[The Bronx]], New York. She received her bachelor's degree in Psychology from [[New York University]], and her PhD in Social and Clinical Psychology from [[Yale University]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

== Career ==

Langer has had a significant influence on the [[positive psychology]] movement.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Drake|date=21 February 2010|title=Mind Power|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/02/21/mind_power/|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being known as the mother of positive psychology, her contributions to the study of mindfulness have earned her the moniker of the "mother of mindfulness."  &lt;ref name=PsychCentral&gt;{{cite web|last1=PsychCentral|title=The Mother of Mindfulness, Ellen Langer|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/02/27/the-mother-of-mindfulness-ellen-langer/|website=psychcentral.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Langer.com /&gt; Together her work has ushered in the movement of mind/body medicine &lt;ref name="Mind-set Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grierson |first1=Bruce |title=What if Age is Nothing but a Mindset? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html |accessdate=20 September 2018 |work=New York Times |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been regarded by many scientist to be an important intellectual movement and one that now has "considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment." &lt;ref name="Mind-Body"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Astin |first1=John |last2=Shapiro |first2=Shauna |last3=Eisenberg |first3=David |last4=Forys |first4=Kelly |title=Mind-Body Medicine: State of the Science, Implications for Practice |journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine |date=March 1, 2003 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=131-147|doi=10.3122/jabfm.16.2.131 |url=http://www.jabfm.org/content/16/2/131.short |accessdate=20 September 2018 |ref=Mind-Body Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has published over 200 articles and academic texts, was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and discussed her works on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; Additionally, in many introductory psychology courses at universities across the United States, her studies are required reading.&lt;ref name=Boston /&gt;

=== Aging ===
Langer and colleagues have conducted multiple forms of research to promote the flexibility of aging.&lt;ref name=Boston /&gt; Some of her most impactful work has been her pioneering research on her famous Counterclockwise Study (1979). This study was originally published by Oxford University Press&lt;ref name="Human Development"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander (Ed.) |first1=Charles |last2=Langer (Ed.) |first2=Ellen |title=Higher stages of human development: Perspectives on adult growth. |date=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=019503483X |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-98072-000 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in her best seller, ''Mindfulness''.&lt;ref name="Mindfulness"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langer |first1=Ellen |title=Mindfulness |date=1989 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-7382-1800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis of what is now called [[Reminiscence_therapy|Reminiscence Therapy]]. The study was replicated in England, South Korea and the Netherlands&lt;ref name="Mind-set Times"/&gt; and was the basis of a [[British_Academy_Film_Awards|British Academy of Film and Television  Awards]] nominated [[BBC]] series, [https://www.walltowall.co.uk/news/the-young-ones-nominated-for-bafta-in-factual-series-category_363.aspx The Young Ones]. The study has also been mentioned in other media such as [[The_Simpsons|The Simpsons]] episode [[Havana_Wild_Weekend|Havana Wild Weekend]].

Other important work has shown that rewarding behaviors and following completion of memory tasks improves memory. Another study showed that simply taking care of a plant improves mental and physical health, as well as life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodin|first1=Judith|last2=Langer|first2=Ellen J.|title=Long-term effects of a control-relevant intervention with the institutionalized aged.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1977|volume=35|issue=12|pages=897–902|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.12.897|pmid=592095}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were the primitive steps to creating the Langer Mindfulness Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pirson |first1=Michael |last2=Langer |first2=Ellen |last3=Bodner |first3=Todd |last4=Zilcha-Mano |first4=Sigal |title=The Development and Validation of the Langer Mindfulness Scale - Enabling a Socio-Cognitive Perspective of Mindfulness in Organizational Contexts |journal=Fordham University Schools of Business Research Paper |date=October 9, 2012 |pages=54 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research provided for improved methods in [[nursing home]]s and [[Assisted living facility|assisted living facilities]]. Additionally, in one of her most famous studies, Langer demonstrated the drastic benefits of mind/body unity theory. By having chambermaids call their everyday activity “exercise” rather than “labor,” Langer found that the chambermaids experienced a myriad of health benefits including: "a decrease in their systolic blood pressure, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio — and a 10 percent drop in blood pressure."&lt;ref name="NPR Chambermaids"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiegel |first1=Alix |title=Hotel Maids Challenge the Placebo Effect |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17792517 |website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/ellen-langer-science-of-mindlessness-and-mindfulness/6332| title= Ellen Langer - Science of Mindlessness and Mindfulness | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness===
Langer is well known for her contributions to the study of mindfulness and of mindless behaviour, with these contributions having provided the basis for many studies focused on individual differences in unconscious behavior and decision making processes in humans.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scholar|first1=Harvard|title=Ellen Langer, Research|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/langer/pages/research|website=scholar.harvard.edu|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, she published ''Mindfulness'', her first book, and some have referred to her as the "mother of mindfulness".&lt;ref name=PsychCentral&gt;{{cite web|last1=PsychCentral|title=The Mother of Mindfulness, Ellen Langer|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/02/27/the-mother-of-mindfulness-ellen-langer/|website=psychcentral.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Langer.com /&gt;  In an interview with Krista Tippett on the National Public Radio program "On Being," broadcast on Sept. 13, 2015, Langer defined mindfulness as "the simple act of noticing  new things." &lt;ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/ellen-langer-science-of-mindlessness-and-mindfulness/6332| title= Ellen Langer - Science of Mindlessness and Mindfulness | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Langer Mindfulness Scale is still used in modern research.

== Awards ==
In 1980, she was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=Langer.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langer|first1=Ellen|title= Ellen Langer Bio |url=http://ellenlanger.com/about|website=ellenlanger.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other honors include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the [[American Psychological Association]], [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/ellen-langer-joins-group-of-geniuses/ the Liberty Science Center Genius Award,] the Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to Applied Psychology award from the [[American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology]], the James McKeen Cattel Award, and the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize.

== Criticism ==
Her finding that taking care of a plant significantly improved health outcomes in nursing home patients was shown to be the result of a statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rodin, J., &amp; Langer, E. J. (1978). Erratum to Rodin and Langer. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36(5), 462.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-09641-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of her famous "counterclockwise" studies, Langer claimed that when elderly men were temporarily placed in a setting that recreated their past, their health improved, and they even looked younger. However, this study was never published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The only publication of this finding is in a chapter of a book edited by Langer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellen Langer's reversing aging experiment - Business Insider|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ellen-langers-reversing-aging-experiment-2015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 2014 New York Times Magazine profile, Langer described the week-long paid adult counterclockwise retreats she was creating in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, aimed towards replicating the effects found in her New Hampshire study. According to the article, "Langer makes no apologies for the paid retreats, nor for what will be their steep price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What if Age Is Nothing but a Mind-Set?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langer was defiant when pressed on the ethics of her study:

&lt;blockquote class="templatequote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To my question of whether such a nakedly commercial venture will undermine her academic credibility, Langer rolled her eyes a bit. 'Look, I’m not 40 years old. I’ve paid my dues, and there’s nothing wrong with making this more widely available to people, since I deeply believe it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What if Age Is Nothing but a Mind-Set?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">'''Environmental design''' is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans, programs, policies, buildings, or products. Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors; however, the [[environmental movement]] beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Richard Plunz|last=Chermayeff | first=Serge | title=Design and the public good : selected writings, 1930-1980 | publisher=MIT Press | publication-place=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-262-16088-9 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment. These fields include [[architecture]], [[geography]], [[urban planning]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[interior design]]. Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as [[historical preservation]] and [[lighting]] design. In terms of a larger scope, environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products: innovative automobiles, [[wind-electricity]] generators, [[solar-electric]] equipment, and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples. Currently, the term has expanded to apply to ecological and [[sustainability]] issues.

==History==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The photo shows a training meeting with factory workers in a stainless steel [[ecodesign]] company from [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:i2amvaz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of an ancient house in the Greek city of [[Priene]]. {{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 8 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
The first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on [[solar heating]], which began in [[Ancient Greece]] around 500 BCE. At the time, most of Greece had exhausted its supply of [[fuel wood|wood for fuel]], leading architects to design houses that would capture the [[solar energy]] of the sun.  The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year. For a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south, at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith, while in winter, the sun travels a lower trajectory, with a [[zenith]] of 26 degrees. Greek houses were built with south-facing façades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter, warming the house. Additionally, the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds. This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the [[grid pattern]] of ancient cities. With the North-South orientation of the houses, the streets of Greek cities mainly ran East-West.

The practice of solar architecture continued with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who similarly had deforested much of their native [[Italian Peninsula]] by the first century BCE. The Roman ''[[heliocaminus]]'', literally 'solar furnace', functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses. The numerous public baths were oriented to the south. Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape. The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote of [[greenhouse]]s that supplied the kitchen of the [[Emperor Tiberius]] during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://habitat.aq.upm.es/boletin/n9/amvaz.html|title=Una brevísima historia de la arquitectura solar|author=|date=|journal=Boletín CF+S|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector, the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed [[curved mirror]]s that could concentrate the sun's rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver, copper or brass.

Early roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th Century with writer/designer [[William Morris]], who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper, fabrics and books his studio produced. He and others, such as [[John Ruskin]] felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers.

The narrative of Brian Danitz and Chris Zelov's documentary film ''[[Ecological Design: Inventing the Future]]'' asserts that in the decades after World War II, "The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry."  From the middle of the twentieth century, thinkers like [[Buckminster Fuller]] have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers.  Nowadays, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[appropriate technology]], [[organic horticulture]] and [[Organic agriculture|agriculture]], [[environmental restoration|land restoration]], [[New Urbanism]], and ecologically [[sustainable energy]] and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application.

By integrating renewable energy sources such as [[solar photovoltaic]], [[solar thermal]], and even [[geothermal energy]] into structures, it is possible to create [[zero emission]] buildings, where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting. It is also possible to construct "energy-plus buildings" which generate more energy than they consume, and the excess could then be sold to the grid. In the [[United States]], the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability.

==Environmental design and planning==
'''Environmental design and planning''' is the moniker used by several Ph.D. programs that take a multidisciplinary approach to the built environment. Typically environmental design and planning programs address architectural history or design (interior or exterior), city or regional planning, landscape architecture history or design, environmental planning, construction science, cultural geography, or historic preservation. Social science methods are frequently employed; aspects of sociology or psychology can be part of a research program.

The concept of "environmental" in these programs is quite broad and can encompass aspects of the natural, built, work, or social environments.

=== Academic programs ===
The following universities offer a Ph.D. in environmental design and planning:
*[http://www.clemson.edu/caah/pdbe/ Clemson University, College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities] (Now called "Planning, Design, and the Built Environment")
*[http://design.asu.edu/phd/ Arizona State University, College of Design]
*[http://www.k-state.edu/grad/gscurrent/catalog/epd.htm Kansas State University]
*[https://www.ucalgary.ca/evds/phd_2008 University of Calgary] (technically the Ph.D. is in "environmental design," but encompasses the same scope as the other programs)

Virginia Tech until recently offered the degree program, but has since [http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2006&amp;itemno=161 replaced] it with programs in "architecture and design research" and "planning, governance, and globalization".

Fanshawe College in London, Ontario Canada offers an honours bachelor's degree called "Environmental Design and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/bed1-honours-bachelor-environmental-design-and-planning/next-year|title=Honours Bachelor of Environmental Design and Planning - Fanshawe College|author=|date=|website=www.fanshawec.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related programs ===
* University of Missouri, Columbia: [http://www.missouri.edu/~arch/resources/FinalGraduatePages.pdf Ph.D. in Human Environmental Sciences] (PDF file) with emphasis in Architectural Studies. 
* Texas A &amp; M University offers a [http://archone.tamu.edu/architecture/grad_frame.html Ph.D. in architecture] that emphasizes environmental design.

==Examples==
Examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways.

Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology, regarding ecology as the basis for design. Some believe that strategies of conservation, stewardship, and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community, with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems.

Specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include:
*[[Boston Transportation Planning Review]]
*BART - [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] System Daly City Turn-back project and airport extension.
*[[Metropolitan Portland]], Oregon light rail system

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9419">The '''exhausted combination doctrine''', also referred to as the '''doctrine of the''' '''''Lincoln Engineering''''' '''case''', is the doctrine of [[U.S. patent law]] that when an inventor invents a [[novelty (patent)|new]], [[non-obviousness|unobvious]] device and seeks to patent not merely the new device but also the combination of the new device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated, the combination is unpatentable as an "exhausted combination" or "old combination".&lt;ref&gt;For example, consider the invention of a new microprocessor, which is patentable in its own right. Suppose that the inventor seeks to patent computers containing the new microprocessor, where the microprocessor cooperates with the other elements of the computers in the same conventional way that microprocessors have previously cooperated with the other elements of computers. The computer with the new microprocessor would be an exhausted combination. This hypothetical case is based on the facts of the recent [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the ''Lincoln Engineering'' case because the [[United States Supreme Court]] explained the doctrine in its decision in ''Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/303/545/case.html Justia] and [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=303&amp;invol=545 FindLaw], 303 U.S. 545 (1938)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Lincoln Engineering'' decision==
In ''Lincoln Engineering'', the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling.  The Supreme Court stated that "the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination".&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 549-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It then concluded that the inventor's "effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void."&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 552.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This way of claiming an invention was termed “overclaiming,” because it inflated the royalty base for licensing and potentially effectuated a [[tie-in]] by means of which the patentee required users, for example, to purchase not only the couplings but the whole grease gun as well in order to use the invention.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFIMX6L-nMUC&amp;pg=PT238&amp;lpg=PT238&amp;dq=overclaiming+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3lPZqoxw1&amp;sig=qpu4MeL18AMLeLdW9mNz9JmZrz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPT238,M1 ''Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting''] § 8:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is the ''Lincoln Engineering'' doctrine obsolete?==
The Federal Circuit held in 1984 that this doctrine is outdated and no longer reflects the law.&lt;ref&gt;See Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  The Federal Circuit’s predecessor court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had made similar suggestions. See, e.g., In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the Federal Circuit overruled the Supreme Court on this point—or claimed that the passage of the 1952 patent recodification law had done so. 

In its decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as ''Lincoln Engineering'' (uncited in the ''Quanta'' opinion) are still in force, as least with regard to the [[exhaustion doctrine]]. In ''Quanta'', the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to "exhaust" not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same inventive concept (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.

After 1984 it appeared that it was possible to obtain patents on old combinations, for example not only a new motor but also an otherwise conventional disc drive containing the new motor. It has also been held that the sale of the motor, in such a case, does not exhaust the patent on the disc drive containing the new motor. Hence, a purchaser of the motor who incorporated it into a disk drive would infringe the disk drive patent.&lt;ref&gt;See Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; It is now uncertain whether such patents are valid. In any event, the [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.|''Quanta'']] decision appears to hold that the [[exhaustion doctrine]] shields from infringement liability the foregoing motor purchaser that incorporates the motor into a disk drive.&lt;ref&gt; This result would be contrary to that reached in Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhausted combinations and nonstatutory subject matter==
Claiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination may provide a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as [[nonstatutory subject matter]] under section 101 of the US patent law. Placing a process that fails the [[machine-or-transformation test]] in a machine environment may overcome the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by [[In re Bilski]] and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based.&lt;ref&gt;This expedient was suggested initially in Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/AlgWar.pdf ''Tales From the Algorithm War''], 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; (The successfulness of this expedient depends on acceptance of the Federal Circuit's abolition of the exhausted combination doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.'', 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984); ''In re Bernhardt'', 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;)

For example, the form of the processes claimed in ''[[Diamond v. Diehr]]'',&lt;ref&gt;450 U.S. 175 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'',&lt;ref&gt;437 U.S. 584 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]''&lt;ref&gt;409 U.S. 63 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; may appropriately be compared. In ''Diehr'', the claim is to “a method of operating a rubber-molding press” and the claim contains at least minimal references to the press and other apparatus. In ''Flook'', the claim is to a "method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit," where an “’alarm limit’ is a number.” The claim does not say anything about a reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. In ''Benson'', the claim is to “a  data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.” One claim mentions a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentions no apparatus at all. In ''Flook'', the claim could have instead been to “a method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is placed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.” The claim, although to an exhausted combination,&lt;ref&gt;The Court’s opinion states that it was conceded that the process was known and conventional except for its use of the algorithm.&lt;/ref&gt; would have required apparatus as did that in the ''Diehr'' case. Similarly, the claim in ''Benson'' could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary-coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a mechanical environment, even though it was an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter. It is possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine-or-transformation test.

The preceding analysis may have been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]''. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'' and ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is that the presence of a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an "inventive concept." The inventive concept must provide "something extra" that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.&lt;ref&gt;See generally the cases discussed in the Wikipedia article [[Software patents under United States patent law]], particularly the last several footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictorum Factorumque Memorabilium Libri IX.jpg|thumb|1830 version of ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'']]
'''''Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX''''' ("nine books of memorable deeds and sayings", also known as ''De factis dictisque memorabilibus'' or ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'') by [[Valerius Maximus]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. CE 50) was written around CE 30 or 31.&lt;ref name="pagexiii"&gt;Walker, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Valerius.html ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition (2001-07), s.v. "Valerius Maximus"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of approximately a thousand short stories that Valerius wrote during the reign of [[Tiberius]] (42 BCE&amp;nbsp;– CE 37).&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt; The stories are a variety of anecdotes illustrating how the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] lived.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; While the majority of the stories are of Roman life, he does have some foreign stories at the end of some chapters. Most of these are of [[Ancient Greece|Greek life]] and most of those are about [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] or famous kings.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the stories relate to moral subjects that parallel those in the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. Valerius refers to his moral stories as "examples" that were to be used as moral guidance.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"/&gt; Valerius' work on the preservation of moral values of the [[Roman Republic]] of the past was widely popular through the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a literary life-span of some 1,700 years. People read Valerius' work for practical guidance in their everyday tasks for living a moral life.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"&gt;Walker, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; This work was especially used as a reference by writers and professional [[Public speaking|orators]].&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;

It is estimated that Valerius's work on these nine books took over a decade.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He obtained material from [[Cicero]], and from [[Livy]], [[Sallust]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and other ancient historians.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; Each of the nine books has several chapters. Each chapter is outlined and grouped [[theme (literature)|thematically]] and contains several stories illustrating that theme.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="table"&gt;Walker, p. vii '''Table of Contents'''&lt;/ref&gt; This work is the earliest known use of a [[hierarchical organization]] system for topics of a book.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University Press article ''[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8216.html A short history of information retrieval]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 91 chapters covering a wide variety of subjects drawn from Roman life.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; Valerius arranges his chapters focused on particular [[virtue]]s, moral and immoral habits, religious practices, superstitions and ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; There is a thematic guide at the end of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==

===Omens===
One example of Valerius' balanced subject themes covered is where he writes stories about [[omen]]s.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the observations of omens had a connection to [[religion in ancient Rome]] since many people of that time believed that omens were from divine providence.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius records that omens had played an important role when Rome had been demolished by the [[Gauls]] in 390 BCE. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] was debating whether they should then move Rome to [[Veii]] or rebuild the city walls.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  While they were deciding some [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s had just returned from guard duty.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Their [[centurion]] then just happened to shout in the assembly place, "Standard-bearer, set up the standard; this is the best place for us to stay." The city was rebuilt in the same place then, since they interpreted these words as an omen.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auspices===
One of the subject themes that Valerius wrote about was the [[superstition]] of [[auspices]] in Book 1 Chapter 4.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Auspices means "bird observations." It is from the [[Latin]] words of ''avis'' (bird) and ''spicere'' (to sight or watch).&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Before doing anything of great importance, the Romans would "take the auspices" in order to determine what the [[Roman mythology|gods]] approved.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This was an examination of the behavior of birds in flight or eating.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It was interpreted by an [[augur]] as to the will of the gods from this behavior.

A Roman story that Valerius writes about is the founding of Rome by [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He records that the founding of the city was based on the auspices. Remus was the first to "take the auspices" by seeing six [[vulture]]s.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus later however saw twelve vultures. Romulus claimed he had a stronger claim because he saw a larger quantity, even though Remus was the first to spot vultures.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "foreign" story Valerius writes on this theme for a comparison is on the founding of the city of [[Alexandria]] in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 331 BCE. The [[architect]] was [[Deinocrates]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He records that when Deinocrates was going to design a great city in Egypt, he had no chalk to use for writing.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used a large quantity of [[barley]], and drew out the plans on the ground.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A group of birds then came from a nearby lake and ate the barley.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian augur interpreted this to mean that there would be plenty of food for a large city there.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modesty===
[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cato the Elder]]]]
Valerius writes on the theme of [[modesty]] in Book 4 Chapter 5 about the fact that there was no separate seating for the Conscript Fathers (Roman Senators) at the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"&gt;Walker, p. 142, Book 4 Chapter 5.1 reads, ''From the foundation of our city to the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Longus there was no separate seating for the Senate and the people when they watched the games. In spite of this, no member of the plebs ever brought himself to sit in front of the Conscript Fathers at the theater; the respect shown in our state was so scrupulous.''&lt;/ref&gt; This was from the beginnings of Rome in the 8th century BCE until the time of the consulship of [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 194 BCE)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] in 194 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this no member of the [[pleb]]s ever sat in front of the Conscript Fathers.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Their respect for this tradition was also shown when one day [[Lucius Quinctius Flamininus]] was to stand in the very back of the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; He was placed there because he had been removed from the Roman Senate by [[Cato the Censor]] and [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]]. Flamininus already held the office of [[Roman consul|consul]] and was the brother of [[Titus Flamininus]] (consul 192 BCE), who had defeated [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 197 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this he still was forced to go to the back of the theater by Cato the Elder. Out of respect however, the entire audience moved Flamininus to the very front so that nobody was in front of him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius illustrates another story of modesty when he writes of [[Gaius Terentius Varro]].&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Varro devastated the Roman Republic when he started the [[Battle of Cannae]], one of the worst battles of recorded history. His sense of shame would not allow him to accept dictatorship, even though it was offered to him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; The people of the Republic attributed the great loss to the anger of the gods. On the inscription under his death mask shows his good character which brought him more honor that most men receive from the dictatorship position itself.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius records another story of modesty where king [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] hears of the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]].&lt;ref name="modesty2"&gt;Walker, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately sends as a gift to Rome 70,000 bushels of wheat, 50,000 bushels of barley, and 240 pounds of gold.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt; So that the gold was accepted and not returned he presented it in the form of a statue of victory. This was so the Roman people would accept it on religious grounds.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt;

===Parenting===
[[File:Halle CorneliaMotherOfTheCracchi.jpg|thumb|left|An 18th-century portrayal of [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]] proclaiming "These are my jewels," in reference to [[Gracchi|her sons]]]]
Another example of Valerius' themes is where he writes stories about Roman parents and the affection they had toward their children. A story in Book 4 Chapter 4 on ''Poverty'' is about the [[Gracchus|Gracchus brothers]], [[Gaius Gracchus]] and his younger brother [[Tiberius Gracchus]]. The story relates how one day [[Cornelia Africana]], their mother (daughter of Publius Cornelius [[Scipio Africanus]]), was pestered by a lady guest that was showing off her elegant jewellery. Cornelia patiently endured this lady until her sons came home from school. Then, introducing them to this lady, she proclaimed proudly, "These are my jewels."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example in Book 8 Chapter 8 is about the philosopher [[Socrates]]. He writes of him showing an intimate side which did not distract from his stature because, as Valerius puts it, ''no part of wisdom was hidden from him.'' He tells how Socrates one time made a [[hobby horse|hobbyhorse]] out of [[Reed bed|reed]] for his sons. He would then play with the hobbyhorse with them showing Socrates' personal parental side.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes many stories of other Roman fathers which generally are contrary to the stereotypical image of being brutal and harsh.&lt;ref name=pagexv&gt;Walker, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these examples are in Book 5 Chapter 7 titled ''The Love and Indulgence of Parents towards Their Children.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the real fathers are the ones that are benignly permissive and show indulgence.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt; He reports with delight that this kind of father could be found in the streets of Rome and that these fathers ''were as gentle as fathers in a comedy.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He does, however, describe in Book 5 Chapter 8 ''Fathers who were severe with their children'' some all-powerful Roman abusive fathers as being tyrannical [[patriarch]]s killing and murdering others including of their own blood. He clearly reports these that are extremely strict and severe as no longer in the role of being a loving father.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who killed his sons for failing in their military duties, ''He left the role of a father so that he could play the part of a [[Roman consul|consul]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/5*.html#8.1 Book 5, Chapter 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of these role changes can be found in Book 6. In Chapter 1.5 where Valerius tells the story of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus]],&lt;ref name="page19915"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.5, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Eburnus had carried out the highest public offices with great splendor and finished off his career with much dignity; however, he had his son punished for a chastity that was dubious.&lt;ref name="page19915"/&gt; In Chapter 1.6 Valerius writes about Publius Atilius Philiscus who was abused as a child.&lt;ref name="page19916"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.6, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; When he became an adult, Philiscus became a strict father on chastity.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt; Learning of his daughter's premarital sex, he murdered her.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt;

===The role of women===
{{See also|Women in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Tizian 094.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s image of the rape of Lucretia]]
Valerius writes of Roman women being generally in seclusion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} He reports in Book 6 on ''Chastity'' the stereotypical woman as being well-behaved and who would rather face death than dishonor. One story is of [[Lucretia]] in Book 6 Chapter 1.1.&lt;ref name="page198"&gt;Walker, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that she was violently forced to have sex with [[Sextus Tarquinius]], the son of King [[Tarquin the Proud]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Lucretia could not bear the disgrace and committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Another example is about [[Hippo, a Greek woman]]. She committed suicide rather than being raped by drunken sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.1 Book 6. ext. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius even writes in Book 2, Chapter 6.14, of [[suttee]] being an admired practice model for all women to follow in his day.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/2*.html#6.14 Book 2 Chapter 6.14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}
Valerius writes about homosexuality, which was an unusual category for that time period of writers.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"&gt;Walker, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of private life was kept under wraps.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; The only relationship along these lines that was tolerated by law was that between a master and a slave.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; Valerius, however, does report on male homosexuality in the [[Roman army]] and the [[upper class]].&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; He does not report on female homosexuality nor "[[gay women]]" as some writers did at the time.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Roman army===
In the stories of the Roman army, Valerius always records high-ranking military personnel taking advantage of their position. In Book 6 Chapter 1.10 Valerius tells the story of Gaius Cornelius.&lt;ref name="page200110"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.10, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#1.10 Book 6, Chapter 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded four times by his superiors to be the senior [[centurion]] of his [[Roman legion|legion]].&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; However Gaius Pescennius, a ''triumvir capitalis'' (prison manager) in CE 149, had Cornelius thrown in jail and shackled in irons for having sexual relations with a young boy of free birth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius did not deny the charges and was prepared to make a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sponsio|sponsio]]'' (legal guarantee).&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; In so doing, Cornelius was making a statement and putting down a sum of money as a guarantee of truth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; If the guaranteed statement was found to be false, the young boy was to be paid this amount.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; His statement was to say that the boy openly and willingly sold his body for cash.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; The [[tribune]]s refused to allow this, since they thought soldiers of the Roman Republic should not make deals in which they could pay for pleasures at home by facing dangers overseas.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius spent the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.11 Valerius tells the story of Marcus Laetorius Mergus.&lt;ref name="page200111"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.11, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Cominius and a tribune of the [[pleb]]s summoned Mergus, a high-ranking military career person, before the people because of sexual relations with young men and women outside his marriage. He was prosecuted and sent to prison.&lt;ref name="page200111"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.12 Valerius tells the story of [[Chiomara]].&lt;ref name="page202112"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1. ext. 2, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.2 Book 6, ext. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiomara was the wife of Ortiagon. During the [[Galatian War]] with Rome of 189 BC, [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] was victorious in a campaign against the Galatian Gauls.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives including Chiomara. The centurion made sexual advances towards her and she rejected him.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; Under violence and force he raped her. The centurion then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her relatives.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; When he received his ransom and was counting the gold pieces, Chiomara secretly indicated to her relatives to murder him and cut off his head.&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"/&gt; She later presented the head of the centurion to her husband.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt;

===Political views===
[[File:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coin of [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]]]]
The political views of ordinary Romans basically were not written on by most ancient writers.&lt;ref name="rarely"&gt;Walker, P. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius, however, did write about the grassroots customs of Rome as a democratic society.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He points out that the poorer Romans had goals as to where they wanted to ultimately be and in what direction they wanted to go.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

One example of how political views were looked upon in his days is where he writes a story on [[Sextus Titus]], who kept a picture in his residence of a murdered [[Extremism|radical]] called [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]].&lt;ref name="stitus"&gt;Walker, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.3 Book 8, Chapter 8.1.damn.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus was popular with the people because of a new land reform law he proposed; however, he was prosecuted and punished just because of the picture and his political views.&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt; He writes that the Romans felt a personal loyalty to the memory of these reformers. The tribal assembly of [[plebeian]]s felt that this memory could be led astray if there was an association to a radical.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt;

Many times there were [[imposter]]s that said they were sons of populist leaders like [[Tiberius]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Gracchus]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. The people of Rome loved them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#7.1 Book 9, Chapter 7.1 and 7.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#15.1 Book 9, Chapter 15. 1 -4]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he records that one claimed to be the grandson of Gaius Marius and drew a crowd as what [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] himself would obtain.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

Valerius records the attitudes of the [[aristocracy]] and the contempt to which the [[Working class|lower class]] was subjected by the Roman elite. He demonstrates this with a story about [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]]. Scipio one day preached to a group of [[pleb]]s that basically they are nothing other than just a level above being slaves. He tells them they don't even deserve to call Italy their home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#2.3 Book 6, Chapter 6.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius shows a similar concept with [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. The story goes that Nasica treated a poor man with ridicule and contempt because his hands were so rough from manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/7*.html#5.2 Book 7 Chapter 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes of still another example where the aristocratic Claudia had hoped for more of the Roman common people to have been finished off in the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.4 Book 8, Chapter 1.damn.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EumenesII.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Coin of [[Eumenes II]]]]

===Generosity===
Valerius gives examples of generosity in Book 5 Chapter 8.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that generosity is given to those that are poor.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word for generosity is ''liberalitas''. The god of wine is Liber. The god Liber and the word ''liberalitas'' come from the word ''liber'', meaning "free." Here he tells the story of how, after the Romans captured Asia from King [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BCE, they gave a large portion of it to their ally King [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamum]] free as a permanent gift.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of generosity which Valerius writes about occurs after the Romans had defeated [[Philip V of Macedonia]]. In 196 BCE, the Greeks had the [[Isthmian Games]]. Here [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] proclaimed the independence of the Greek states from [[Macedon]]ian rule.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; At the games, the stadium was full of people and Titus had the herald make the following proclamation: "The Roman people and Senate, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, their general, having vanquished the Macedonians and Philip, their king, order that Greece shall be free from foreign garrisons, not subject to tribute, and shall live under her own customs and laws."&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindness and compassion===
The themes in Chapter 1 of Book 5 are [[kindness]] and [[compassion]]; Valerius gives several examples based on these concepts.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered these lesser [[virtue]]s than [[generosity]], although companions of it.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that kindness is shown to those that are in trouble and compassion is for those whose luck has turned against them.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered generosity to be the one that derived its name from a god, and should receive the most approval of these three.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

One Roman story is where Valerius gives an example of generosity, kindness and compassion. Here he explains that one day the [[Roman Senate]] was offered a large sum of ransom money for the release of 2,743 Carthaginian soldiers and refused it. The Senate released the soldiers to the representatives that had come to get them, and forgave the crimes. The representatives were astonished and even admitted that they themselves would not have been so kind and generous.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Roman story in which Valerius writes about kindness is where king [[Syphax]] of western Numidia died in prison in Tibur (modern day [[Tivoli, Italy]]) in 201 BCE. The Senate gave him a state funeral with a proper burial.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar Roman story in which Valerius writes about compassion is where the Senate sent a [[quaestor]] to Alba (in [[Latium]]) in 167 BCE. There King [[Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] was banished to and had just died there. They wanted to give him honor and provided a state funeral for the king.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forum romanum 1880.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Forum]]]]

===Gratitude===
Valerius gives examples of gratitude in Book 5 Chapter 2 as the theme.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One example is when Valerius writes about how [[Capua]] was being besieged by [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] at the [[first Battle of Capua]]; there were two Campanian women who had kind feelings for Rome. They devoted much of their time and property to its benefit.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One was Vestia Oppia, a married woman with a family, who labored everyday for the Roman army.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Cluvia Facula, a prostitute, who supplied food to the Roman [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; When Capua was defeated, the Roman Senate gave back their freedom and property and rewarded them. These two momen were even praised at an important Senate meeting in 210 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius gives another example of gratitude when he writes of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] (c. 280 BC – 203 BC), called '''Cunctator''' (''the Delayer'').&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius died in 203 BCE after being [[Roman consul|consul]] for five terms. Many people of Rome generously gave money to his funeral in gratitude for his leadership.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; When he was still alive, to show gratitude of his outstanding service to the Roman people, a [[referendum]] of the [[pleb]]s gave equal power to his [[magister equitum]] [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|Marcus Minucius Rufus]] as co-dictator in 217 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carthage location 2.png|thumb|left|[[Carthage]] location]]

===Ingratitude===
Valerius gives as the theme "ingratitude" in Book 4 Chapter 3. Valerius writes that [[Scipio Aemilianus]], grandson of famous general [[Scipio Africanus]], had destroyed two major cities, [[Numantia]] and [[Carthage]], that were major threats to Rome. However, in Rome later, he met his death in mysterious circumstances in 129 BCE.&lt;ref name="myster"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html#1.12 Book 4, Chapter 1.12]&lt;/ref&gt; There was never anyone in the [[Roman Forum]] that avenged his death.&lt;ref name="myster"/&gt;

Valerius writes of another example on ingratitude being the circumstances around [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. Nasica had led a group of conservative senators of the Roman Senate to kill the populist tribune of the plebs [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE.&lt;ref name="merit"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/3*.html#2.17 Book 3, Chapter 2.17]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon afterward had to withdraw from public life because the people of Rome had judged his merits unfairly.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; Nasica, a [[Pontifex Maximus]], went to [[Pergamum]] ostensibly as a [[diplomat]] and never returned.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; He died there, but never missed his country because the Roman people were so ungrateful for what he considered a great deed he had done for them.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt;

===Infamous crimes===
On another theme, Valerius writes of several examples of infamous crimes in Book 8 Chapter 1 and how they related to [[jealousy]].&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

One example Valerius records of acquittal ''(absoluti)'' is where Marcus Horatius is found guilty by King [[Tullus Hostilius]] of killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.abs.1 Book 8 Chapter 1.abs.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Horatius was acquitted of the crime when he appealed to the public.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The brutal nature of the killing influenced King Tullus to convict him; however, the motive for which Horatius did it influenced the people.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In a battle defending Rome Horatius defeated the Curiatius brothers and killed them. His sister was in love with one of these brothers and planned on marrying him.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; She wept over him, hearing of his death. Horatius murdered her then because of her premature love affair with the enemy.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The people of Rome felt this was harsh punishment rather than an actual crime of the Roman Republic. Horatius received glory for not only killing the Curiatius brothers, the enemy, but for killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In this case the Roman people were acting as a strict guardian of chastity.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case Valerius records is where the Roman people were acting as an unfair, lax judge. In this case [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]] was being harshly denounced at the [[rostra]] by [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]], tribune of the plebs in 149 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder]] supported the tribune's charges in a grand speech at a [[Roman assemblies|Roman assembly]] as is recorded in his ''Origins''.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba had committed an atrocious [[war crime]] against the [[Lusitanians]]. He had made a peace agreement with the Lusitanians, but then massacred 8,000 of them while he was governor of [[Hispania|Spain]] in 150 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba, being a great speaker in his own right, had no real defense for his crimes. Through bribery and bringing forth his children and the orphan child of a relative before the public in a speech for mercy, he procured his acquittal.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case where Valerius records ancient history crimes is about Gaius Cosconius, [[praetor]] in 89 BCE and governor of [[Illyria]] from 78 to 76 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of misgovernment under the [[Servilian Law]] passed in 101 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; There was no doubt that he was guilty; however, he recited a poem about his accuser, Valerius Valentinus, and got an acquittal.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was about how Valerius seduced a young man in a striped [[toga]] and a young freeborn woman. Valerius was then convicted by the acquittal of Cosconius.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outrageous behavior===
Valerius reports in Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that [[Alexander the Great]] had three stages of arrogance.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.1 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.1]&lt;/ref&gt; One was that he looked down on his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] and claimed that Jupiter Hammon was his real father.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Another was that he took up the ways of the [[Persian people]] by dressing and behaving their way.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Still another was that Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;

Valerius writes another foreign story here of [[Xerxes I of Persia]].&lt;ref name="xerxes"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.2 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.2]&lt;/ref&gt; To show his outrageous behavior and arrogance, he tells how Xerxes summoned all the leaders of Asia together.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Just as he was about to declare war on Greece, he tells them, ''I did not want people to think that I was acting on my own initiative, so I brought you together here. But remember that it is your duty to obey me rather than persuade me.''&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Valerius reports that in the invasion, Xerxes suffered such a defeat that one would wonder if his words were just arrogance or stupidity.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt;

Valerius writes on still another foreign story of [[Hannibal]] and how arrogant he was after his success at the [[Battle of Cannae]].&lt;ref name="hannibal"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.3 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.3]&lt;/ref&gt; He tells how Hannibal had [[delusions of grandeur]] and would not then receive any of his fellow citizens directly. He would only communicate through a go-between.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt; He even insulted his cavalry commander Maharbal, who had said in front of his tent in a loud voice that he had planned things so that Hannibal would be dining on the Capitol in Rome within a few days.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt;

==Other topics==
Some other subjects that Valerius wrote about included:
*Bravery
*Cruelty
*Dreams
*Fidelity
*Friendship
*Innate characteristics
*Moderation
*Modesty
*Omens
*Parental Love
*Physical resemblance
*Prestige

In [[systems design]], a '''fail-fast''' system is one which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early.  The responsibility of a fail-fast module is detecting errors, then letting the next-highest level of the system handle them.

== Hardware and software ==
Fail-fast systems or modules are desirable in several circumstances:

* When building a [[fault-tolerant system]] by means of redundant components, the individual components should be fail-fast to give the system enough information to successfully tolerate a failure.
* Fail-fast components are often used in situations where failure in one component might not be visible until it leads to failure in another component.
* Finding the cause of a failure is easier in a fail-fast system, because the system reports the failure with as much information as possible as close to the time of failure as possible.  In a [[fault-tolerant]] system, the failure might go undetected, whereas in a system that is neither [[fault-tolerant]] nor fail-fast the failure might be temporarily hidden until it causes some seemingly unrelated problem later.
* A fail-fast system that is designed to halt as well as report the error on failure is less likely to erroneously perform an irreversible or costly operation.

Developers also refer to fail-fast code to a code that tries to fail as soon as possible at variable or object initialization. In OOP, a fail-fast designed object initializes the internal state of the object in the constructor, launching an exception if something is wrong (vs allowing non-initialized or partially initialized objects that will fail later due to a wrong "setter"). The object can then be made [[Immutable object|immutable]] if no more changes to the internal state are expected. In functions, fail-fast code will check input parameters in the [[precondition]]. In client-server architectures, fail-fast will check the client request just upon arrival, before processing or redirecting it to other internal components, returning an error if the request fails (incorrect parameters, ...). Fail-fast designed code decreases the  internal [[software entropy]], and reduces debugging effort.

=== Examples ===
From the field of [[software engineering]], a '''Fail Fast Iterator''' is an [[iterator]] that attempts to raise an error if the sequence of elements processed by the iterator is changed during [[iteration]].

== Business ==
The term has been widely employed as a metaphor in business, dating back to at least 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanna|first=Rajat|last2=Guler|first2=Isin|last3=Nerkar|first3=Atul|date=2016-04-01|title=Fail Often, Fail Big, and Fail Fast?

It became adopted as a kind of "mantra" within [[Startup company|startup]] culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/epic-fails-of-the-startup-world|title=Epic Fails of the Startup World|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11959">'''False accusations''' (or '''groundless accusations''' or '''unfounded accusations''' or '''false allegations''' or '''false claims''') can be in any of the following contexts:
* Informally in everyday life. 
* [[Quasi-judicial]]ly
* [[Judicial]]ly.

==Types==
When there is insufficient supporting evidence to determine whether an accusation is true or false, it is described as "unsubstantiated" or "unfounded". Accusations that are determined to be false based on corroborating evidence can be divided into three categories:&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;
* An allegation that is completely false, in that the events that were alleged did not occur.
* An allegation that describes events that did occur, but were perpetrated by an individual who is not accused, and in which the accused person is innocent.
* An allegation that is false, in that it mixes descriptions of events that actually happened with other events that did not occur.

A false allegation can occur as the result of [[Lie|intentional lying]] on the part of the accuser;&lt;ref name="mikkel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mikkelsen EJ, Gutheil TG, Emens M |title=False sexual-abuse allegations by children and adolescents: contextual factors and clinical subtypes |journal=Am J Psychother |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=556–70 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1443285 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;Clifton D. Bryant, ''Deviant Behavior: Readings in the Sociology of Norm Violation'' (1990), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; or unintentionally, due to a [[confabulation]], either arising spontaneously due to [[mental illness]]&lt;ref name="mikkel"/&gt; or resulting from deliberate or accidental suggestive questioning, or faulty interviewing techniques.&lt;ref name="Ceci"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maggie Bruck |author2=Ceci, Stephen J |title=Jeopardy in the Courtroom |publisher=Amer Psychological Assn |location= |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=1-55798-282-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Poole and Lindsay suggested in 1997 applying separate labels to the two concepts, proposing the term "false allegations" be used specifically when the accuser is aware they are lying, and "false suspicions" for the wider range of false accusations in which suggestive questioning may have been involved.&lt;ref name="weiner438"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Psychology |author=[[Irving B. Weiner]] |author2=Donald K. Freedheim |year= 2003 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=lBXf1slZBDwC&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 438] | publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn= 0-471-17669-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person is suspected of a wrongdoing for which they are in fact responsible, "false accusation may be used to divert attention from one's own guilt".&lt;ref name="Bryant"/&gt; False accusation may also arise in part from the conduct of the accused, particularly where the accused engages in behaviors consistent with having committed the suspected wrongdoing, either unconsciously or for purposes of appearing guilty.&lt;ref name="Bryant"/&gt; 

Additionally, once a false accusation has been made – particularly an emotionally laden one – normal human emotional responses to being falsely accused (such as fear, anger, or denial of the accusation) may be misinterpreted as evidence of guilt.

==Rape==
{{Main article|False accusation of rape}}
A false accusation of [[rape]] is the intentional reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the prevalence of false accusations because they are often conflated with non-prosecuted cases under the designation "unfounded."&lt;ref name="practical"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC |title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation |year=2008 |editor-first=Robert R. |editor-last=Hazelwood |editor2-first=Ann Wolbert |editor2-last=Burgess |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAOJ"&gt;Gross, Bruce (Spring 2009).

''[[The Forensic Examiner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, the [[FBI]] ''Uniform Crime Report'' in 1996 and the [[United States Department of Justice]] in 1997 stated 8% of rape accusations in the United States were regarded as unfounded or false.&lt;ref name="fbi.gov"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf ''Crime in the United States 1996: Uniform Crime Statistics'', "Section II: Crime Index Offenses Reported."] FBI, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Forensic276"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forensic Victimology: Examining Violent Crime Victims in Investigative and Legal Contexts|last = Turvey|first = Brent E.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2013|isbn = 0124080847|location = |pages = 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rumney&gt;Rumney, Philip N.S.

==Child abuse==
{{Main article|False accusations of child sexual abuse}}
A false allegation of child sexual abuse is an accusation that a person committed one or more acts of [[child sexual abuse]] when in reality there was no perpetration of abuse by the accused person as alleged. Such accusations can be brought by the victim, or by another person on the alleged victim's behalf. Studies of child abuse allegations suggest that the overall rate of false accusation is under 10%, as approximated based on multiple studies.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobbs197"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Abuse and Neglect: A Clinician's Handbook |last= Hobbs |first= CJ |author2=Hanks HGI |author3=Wynne JM  |publisher= [[Elsevier|Elsevier Health Sciences]] |year=1999 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=3w_j-n1tLGcC&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 197] |isbn= 0-443-05896-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schetky105"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Sexual Abuse: A Handbook for Health Care and Legal Professionals |last= Schetky |first=DH |author2=Green AH |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1988 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYyzGgZbllYC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 105] |isbn= 0-87630-495-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolen109"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Sexual Abuse: Its Scope and Our Failure |last= Bolen |first=RM |publisher=Springer |year= 2001 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bzd1ytm7nvoC&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 109] |isbn= 0-306-46576-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the allegations determined to be false, only a small portion originated with the child, the studies showed; most false allegations originated with an adult bringing the accusations on behalf of a child, and of those, a large majority occurred in the context of [[divorce]] and child-custody battles.&lt;ref name="Ney"&gt;{{cite book|title=True and False Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse: Assessment and Case Management |last=Ney |first=T |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1995 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BggJjhbBJzwC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 23–33] |isbn= 0-87630-758-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robin21"&gt;{{cite book|title=Assessing Child Maltreatment Reports: The Problem of False Allegations |last= Robin |first=M |publisher= [[Haworth Press]] |year= 1991 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tqBVMUlMPLIC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 21–24] |isbn= 0-86656-931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace bullying==
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that "falsely accused someone of 'errors' not actually made" is the most common of all bullying tactics experienced, in 71 percent of cases.&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/|title=Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace mobbing==
{{Main article|Workplace mobbing}}
Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and unfounded accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confessionpost.com/22070/i-falsely-accused-my-director)|title=I falsely accused my director|website=www.confessionpost.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Münchausen syndrome by proxy==
{{Main article|Münchausen syndrome by proxy}}
The case has been made that diagnoses of Münchausen syndrome by proxy, that is harming someone else in order to gain attention for oneself, are often false or highly questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnc.com.au/~heleneli/paper.htm|title=False Accusations of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. PHD and more presented by Dr Helen Hayward-Brown.|website=www.pnc.com.au|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalking==
{{Main article|False claims of stalking, gang stalking and delusions of persecution}}
In 1999, Pathe, Mullen and Purcell wrote that popular interest in [[stalking]] was promoting false claims.&lt;ref&gt;M Pathe, PE Mullen, R Purcell; Stalking: false claims of victimisation; British Journal of Psychiatry 174: 170-172 (1999)[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/174/2/170]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sheridan and Blaauw said that they estimated that 11.5% of claims in a sample of 357 reported claims of stalking were false.&lt;ref name="Sheridan and Blauuw 2004"&gt;L. P. Sheridan, E. Blaauw; Characteristics of False Stalking Reports; Criminal Justice and Behavior, Vol. 31, No. 1, 55-72 (2004) {{DOI|10.1177/0093854803259235}} [http://cjb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/1/55]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissistic rage==
{{Main article|Narcissistic rage}}
Rage by a [[narcissist]] is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them. This rage [[Cognitive distortion|impairs their cognition]], therefore impairing their [[judgment]]. During the rage, they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making groundless accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological projection==
{{Main article|Psychological projection}}
Psychological projection can be established as a means of obtaining or justifying certain actions that would normally be found atrocious or heinous. This often means projecting false accusations, information, etc., onto an individual for the sole purpose of maintaining a self-created illusion.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 115 and p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flowers in a Wan-Li Vase''''' is a circa 1620s floral painting by [[Balthasar van der Ast]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q30585921}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q30585921|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Tulips in the Aptekarsky Ogorod 04.JPG|thumb|''Flaming'' variety of tulip in the foreground, today a hardy variety and common enough for public garden planning]]
Balthasar van der Ast was a respected flower painter from [[Middelburg]], active in [[Utrecht]], and considered a member of the ''[[Ambrosius Bosschaert|Bosschaert dynasty]]'' and one of the great flower painters of his time. Little is known about Van der Ast's workshop and whether or not he worked on commission. Even less is known of the early provenance of his paintings. Besides what can be learned from his surviving paintings, archival evidence indicates he was active in Utrecht at the same time as [[Roelant Savery]].

The painting shows flowers of various seasons accompanied by various ''fauna'' in an arranged bouquet on a stone slab, often in an unusual vase, and in this case, a [[Chinese export porcelain]] vessel called a ''Wan-Li vase''. This motief was not his invention and was already quite common among his colleagues, and would remain popular for over a century, with [[Jan van Huysum]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]] still enjoying high prices for their flower bouquets crawling with bugs and reptiles such as this one.

The flaming red and gold tulip at the top is a variety quite common in Dutch gardens today, but is actually suffering from the [[tulip breaking virus]] that gives it that "flaming" striped effect. This painting is symbolic of the popular appreciation of tulips that would reach amazing heights in the so-called [[Tulip Mania]] that was yet to come.

Besides the tulip, the work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa gallica]], [[Anemone hepatica]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Tagetes]], [[Cyclamen]], [[lacerta agilis]], [[Cynthia cardui]], a fly, a dragonfly, and a grasshopper (on the vase).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/70105 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later provenance==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Ukrainian troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of the German Alice Siano who later emigrated to Canada in 1951 (when she married, she became Alice Tittel) with twelve paintings, presumably eight of which were from the Meissen storage depot, and this one appeared on the art market in 1954, where it was purchased by the Dutch art collector [[Sidney J. van den Bergh]] who sold it to a New York collector in 1972. In 1991 it was part of a visiting exhibition "Great Dutch Masters from America" which referred to it as being very similar to the lost Suermondt Museum piece. It has now been purchased back and returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parkstadactueel.nl/2017/06/10/nederlandse-museumdirecteur-haalt-roofkunst-terug-naar-aken/ Dutch museum director retrieves looted art in Aachen], article 10 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The museum had earlier recovered ''[[Flowers in a Glass Vase]]'' by Nicolaes Verendael, which had also been sold by Alice Tittel to a New York collector. About 200 paintings from the museum's collection were stolen in 1945. It is unknown how many are still missing.

'''''Fluxus 1''''' is an [[Artist's Book|artists' book]] edited and produced by the [[Lithuanian-American]] artist [[George Maciunas]], containing works by a series of artists associated with [[Fluxus]], the international collective of avant-garde artists primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally published in New York, 1964, the contents vary from edition to edition, but usually contain work by [[Ay-O]], [[George Brecht]], [[Alison Knowles]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] and [[La Monte Young]] amongst many others.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p110&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has become famous as an early example of [[conceptual art]], and as one of the defining products of the Fluxus collective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Online Retrieved 07-06-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early fluxus==
[[Image:AnthologyFlynt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A single page from ''An Anthology'', by La Monte Young and Jackson Mac Low, 1963. Designed and printed by George Maciunas.]]

===The AG Gallery and proposals for a Yearbox===
Maciunas had originally set up the AG Gallery, 925 [[Madison Avenue]], [[New York City]], to exhibit abstract art and to sell ancient musical instruments; upon meeting [[La Monte Young]] and [[Richard Maxfield]] in late 1960, however, he 'was suddenly confronted with the most radical ideas in art.' Overnight, the gallery  was transformed into a greenhouse for 'the germination of Fluxus',&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p22&lt;/ref&gt; hosting events by [[Dick Higgins]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Yoko Ono]], La Monte Young and others. All of these artists would be included in the forthcoming ''Fluxus 1''; the first known mention of the name ''Fluxus'' came on the invitation cards to 3 events held at the gallery, Spring 1961, in which guests were asked to contribute $3 to 'help publish Fluxus magazine'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/fluxone.htm The Assault on Culture, Stuart Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery had gone bankrupt by mid 1961; to avoid his creditors, Maciunas took a job working for the US Army as a freelance designer in [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany. He took many of the scores collected by La Monte Young for ''AN ANTHOLOGY'', and whilst working on the design and printing for that, also began work on his own anthology ''Fluxus 1''. Modelled in many ways on An Anthology, both works would prove difficult to publish. ''AN ANTHOLOGY'' appeared in Spring 1963; Most of Fluxus 1 was printed by the same German printers contemporaneously, but Maciunas doesn't seem to have put any copies together until sometime in early 1964, by which time he'd left his job in Germany due to bad health and had returned to New York. His letters leave a paper trail of torturous dealings with German printers;

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' deadline is now closed, (all works are at the printer who is scratching his head to the bone.) It should be out in Jan ...|George Maciunas, Dec 2 1962 &lt;ref name="print"&gt;quoted in Fluxus Codex, p107-8&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' $2000 (now 400 pages thick) is 80% completed - very slow printer! but I think I will have them ready end of March ...|George Maciunas, March 11, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|... I will stay in Wiesbaden till Printer completes Fluxus 1 ... (2 printers are working now.) They should have it completed by June 15 ...|George Maciunas, before June 8, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Please accept our belated acknowledgement of your order for ''Fluxus 1'' yearbook. Due to financial difficulties, this fat book will not be issued but the contents will be included in the monthly Fluxus newspaper ...|George Maciunas, Nov 19, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

Originally intended as a six-part series of yearboxes covering America (1), Northern Europe (2), Japan (3), 'Homage To The Past' (4), Southern Europe (5) and Eastern Europe (6), only ''Fluxus 1'' was actually published; whilst predominantly anthologising American artists, both European and Japanese artists were included from material that had originally been intended for other volumes in the series. The book originally sold for $6, with a 'Luxus Fluxus' edition costing $12 containing 'film, tape, objects and accessories' &lt;ref&gt;cc Valise e TRanglE, Fluxus Newspaper no3, march 1964 quoted in Fluxus Codex, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus, collectivism &amp; Anti-art===
Amongst many other influences, Maciunas was directly inspired by [[LEF (journal)|LEF]], the communist journal founded by [[Mayakovsky]] and [[Ossip Brik]]; an artistic organisation aimed at unifying left-wing artists to help build the newly emerging communist state in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Fluxus objectives are social (not aesthetic). They are connected to the group of LEF group of 1929 (sic) in Soviet Union (ideologically) and concern itself with: Gradual elimination of fine arts (music, theatre, poetry, fiction, painting, sculpture etc. etc.) ... Thus Fluxus is definitely against art-object as non-functional commodity - to be sold &amp; to make livelihood for an artist. It could temporarily have the pedagogical function of teaching people the needlessness of itself. It should not be therefore permanent ...
Fluxus therefore is ANTIPROFESSIONAL (against professional art or artists making livelihood from art or artists spending their full time, their life on art.) Secondly FLUXUS is against artas medium or vehicle promoting artist's ego, since applied art should express the objective problem to be solved not artist's personality or his ego. Fluxus should therefore tend towards collective spirit, anonymity and ANTI-INDIVIDUALISM ..... 
These Fluxus concerts, publications etc - are at best transitional (a few years) &amp; temporary until such time when art can be totally eliminated (or at least its institutional forms) and artists find other employment." George Maciunas, January 1964 Quoted in Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fluxus 1'' was Maciunas' first attempt at creating a coherent collective voice, an attempt to erode the artist's status as heroic individual &amp; his first attempt to 'communicate the concept of the self-sufficiency of the audience, an art where anything can substitute for an art work and anyone can produce it.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10457 Michael Corris from Grove Art Online, quoted on MOMA online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture given on the June 9, 1962, [[Wuppertal]], West Germany, to coincide with the launch of the ''Brochure Prospectus for the Fluxus Yearboxes'', Maciunas stated that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anti-art forms are primarily directed against art as a profession, against the artificial separation of producer or performer, of generator and spectator or against the separation of art and life. They oppose forms artificial in themselves, models or methods of composition, of artificially constructed phenomena in the various areas of artistic practice, against intentional, conscious formalism and against the fixation of art on meaning, against the demand of music to be heard and that of plastic art to be seen; and finally against the thesis that both should be acknowledged and understood. Anti-art is life, nature; true reality is the one and all. The bird song is anti-art. The pouring rain, the chattering of an impatient audience, sneeze noises ... or compositions like "letting a butterfly caught in a net fly away" or "what an audience left to its own devices does for amusement"- all of these examples may be viewed in this sense as anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, Kleinen Sommerfest lecture June 9, 1962, quoted in Fluxus Codex p23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maciunas sent out requests for 'critical or non-critical, rational or irrational essays'; scores, instructions ... visual compositions for reproductions, collages, photographs ... solid objects, scraps, smears, junk, garbage, rags, ready-makes (sic), found objects ... or an object (like a flat painting) cut into 200 parts.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p104&lt;/ref&gt; As the yearbox developed, Maciunas became increasingly interested in what he referred to as 'Concretism', derived from [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] ideas about the '[[readymade]]'. In effect, concretism refers to works that don't attempt to transform themselves; objects such as George Brecht's ''Exit'' that remains resolutely a sign indicating the exit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best Fluxus 'Composition' is a most non-personal, 'readymade' one like Brecht's 'Exit'—it does not require any of us to perform it since it happens daily without any 'special' performance of it. Thus our festivals will eliminate themselves (and our need to participate) when they become total readymades (like Brecht's exit) &lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__FSXbtt4Jv4/RyDip8DbmhI/AAAAAAAAAGU/oseRlklVgic/s320/brecht_exit.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The book itself==
[[Image:AFavoriteSong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|2 versions of a single page from ''Fluxus 1'', ''A Favorite Song'' by Joe Jones, next to a version of the same from a copy of the slightly later ''Fluxkit''. These copies in the Silverman collection.]]
The book consists of a number of envelopes bound together by metal bolts, each containing printed works by a single artist. Some copies have the names of the works and of the artists printed onto the envelopes; others are hand-stamped. There is a printed folded sheet attached featuring Maciunas' typographic representations of each artist's name, and the whole book is contained in a wooden case sprayed with the title. The box was used, in part, to facilitate sending the work by post. A number of copies have the recipient's address written directly onto the cover.

Contents might include: a ''Finger Envelope'' by Ay-O featuring an envelope with a slit in it containing a nylon stocking; ''A Favorite Song'' by [[Joe Jones (Fluxus artist)|Joe Jones]] containing 'a scramble of used music typewriter ribbons';&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p279&lt;/ref&gt; ''Disappearing Music for Envelopes'' by Mieko Shiomi consisting of a sequence of envelopes of diminishing sizes within each other; the music score for ''Trois Bagatelles'' by Györgi Ligeti; or ''An Opera'' (see [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/ewilliams-anopera.html]), a short story written on a long scroll by [[Emmett Williams]].

Copies of ''Fluxus 1'' were assembled over a period of 13 years, and whilst the form and much of the content remained fairly stable, 'Maciunas' attitude toward certain artists and/or works in the anthology changed, some works got lost or mislaid, and others ran out of stock.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Marginal figures in Fluxus, such as [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]] and Sohei Hashimoto, were dropped in favour of artists such as Yoko Ono and the Hi Red Center, whilst [[Dick Higgins]] is noticeable by his absence after a feud with Maciunas over the setting up of the [[Something Else Press]].

There are thought to be more than a hundred boxes manufactured between 1964 and 1977 in New York, and a further one hundred or so pieced together in [[Amsterdam]] by Willem De Ridder, for sale in the european Flux Mail Order Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sims and Reed, quoting Philpot and Hendricks, [http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=7787669833&amp;searchurl=bt.x%3D0%26bt.y%3D0%26kn%3Dfluxus%2B1%26sortby%3D1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''formalism''''' describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the [[arts]], [[literature]], or [[philosophy]]. A practitioner of formalism is called a '''''formalist'''''.  A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner.  For example, formalists within [[mathematics]] claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone.  This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth.  Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with "the rules of the game," as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules.  In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon [[axiomatic system]]s.

==Religion==
Formalism in religion means an emphasis on [[ritual]] and [[religious observance|observance]] over their meanings.  Within Christianity, the term [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==
{{Main|Legal formalism}}
Formalism is a school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms.  For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that "judges should apply the law, not make it."  To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, ''formalism'' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
{{Main|formalism (art)}}

Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it.  The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant.  Examples of formalist aestheticians are [[Clive Bell]], [[Jerome Stolnitz]], and [[Edward Bullough]].

===Literary criticism===
{{Main|formalism (literature)}}

In contemporary discussions of [[literary theory]], the school of criticism of [[I. A. Richards]] and his followers, traditionally the [[New Criticism]],  has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical [[rhetoric]]. 

[[Russian formalism]] was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on [[fairy tale]]s, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts&lt;!--Linked from 'Theory of art'--&gt;==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, ''Formalist poets'' may be considered as the opposite of writers of [[free verse]]. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.

See for example:
*''[[The Formalist]]'', a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*[[New Formalism]], a movement within the [[poetry of the United States]].

===Film===
{{Main| Formalist film theory}}
In [[film studies]], formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as [[editing]], shot [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise [[graphical]] (as opposed to [[diegetic]]) qualities of the image.  Strict formalism, condemned by [[Realism (arts)|realist]] film theorists such as [[André Bazin]], has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Sergei Parajanov|Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation.  These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].

==Mathematics==
{{Main|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]]. In common usage, ''a'' formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In [[economic anthropology]], formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of [[neoclassical economics]] can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

This script is the subject of ongoing linguistic and historical research. Discovered manuscripts have been dated up to 1750, and discuss information from as early as the 6th-7th centuries. Much of the information reveals independence initiatives by the Gond Rajas and encounters with the British. Also, the names of the days of the week, the months, the Gond festivals have been discovered in this Gondi script.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chance-discovery-of-gondi-script-opens-new-vistas-of-tribal-culture/article4359780.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">'''Haptic perception''' ({{lang-gr|haptόs|script=latn|italics=yes}} "palpable", ''haptikόs'' "suitable for touch") means literally the ability "to grasp something". [[Perception]] in this case is achieved through the active exploration of surfaces and objects by a moving subject, as opposed to passive contact by a static subject during ''tactile perception''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, E. H. (1851). ''Die Lehre vom Tastsinne und Gemeingefühle auf Versuche gegründet''. Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Haptik'' was coined by the German Psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in 1892, when suggesting a name for academic research into the sense of touch in the style of that in "acoustics" and "optics".&lt;ref&gt;Dessoir, M. (1892). ''Über den Hautsinn''. Arch. f. Anat. u. Physiol., Physiol. Abt., 175–339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, M. &amp; John, M. (2008). German pioneers of research into human haptic perception. In M. Grunwald (Ed.), ''Human Haptic Perception'' (pp. 15-39). Basel, Boston, Berlin: Birkhäuser.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined the haptic system as "[t]he sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body". Gibson and others further emphasized what Weber had realized in 1851:  the close link between haptic perception and body movement, and that haptic perception is active exploration.

The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]], according to which when a tool such as a stick is used, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-VH-Nature2001.pdf Robles-De-La-Torre &amp; Hayward. Force Can Overcome Object Geometry In the perception of Shape Through Active Touch. Nature 412 (6845):445-8 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt; This research allows the creation of "virtual", illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&amp;ch=biotech&amp;sc=&amp;pg=1 "The Cutting edge of haptics"]&lt;/ref&gt; which has clear application in [[haptic technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfh.org/GR-Principles_Haptic_Percept_VE.pdf Robles-De-La-Torre G. Principles of Haptic Perception in Virtual Environments. In Grunwald M (Ed.), ''Human Haptic Perception'', Birkhäuser Verlag, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726191736/http://www.isfh.org/GR-Principles_Haptic_Percept_VE.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploratory procedures ==

People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klatzky RL, Lederman SJ, Metzger VA |year=1985 |title=Identifying objects by touch: An "expert system." |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |issue = 4 |pages=299–302 |doi=10.3758/BF03211351 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They do so through the use of exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lederman SJ, Klatzky RL |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |pmid=3608405 |volume=19 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following exploratory procedures have been identified so far:
#Lateral motion
#Pressure
#Enclosure
#Contour following
Thus gathered object or subject properties are size, weight, contour, surface and material characteristics, consistency and temperature.

== Impairments of haptic sensitivity ==

Haptic sensitivity can be impaired by a multitude of diseases and disorders, predominantly relating to [[skin]] injuries (incisions, burns, etc) and [[nerve]] lesions (through injury or impaired [[circulatory system|circulation]]). Additionally, loss of sensitivity ([[neuropathy]]) may be caused by [[metabolic]], [[toxic]] and/or [[Immune system|immunologic]] factors. Examples of medical conditions that can cause neuropathies are [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chronic kidney disease]], thyroid dysfunction (hyper- and [[hypothyroidism]]) as well as [[hepatitis]], [[liver cirrhosis]] and [[alcohol dependency]].

Loss of the sense of touch is a catastrophic deficit that can impair walking and other skilled actions such as holding objects or using tools.

'''Harassment''' covers a wide range of [[behavior]]s of an [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] nature. It is commonly understood as behavior that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. In the legal sense, these are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. It evolves from [[Discrimination|discriminatory grounds]], and has an effect of nullifying or impairing a person from benefiting their rights. When this behaviors become repetitive it is defined as [[bullying]]. [[Sexual harassment]] refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances even after gently refusing, typically in the workplace, where the consequences are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim if there is a [[Power (social and political)|power]] imbalance between the perpetuator.

==Etymology==
The word is based in English since circa 1618 as a [[loan word]] from the French, which was in turn already attested in 1572 meaning ''torment, annoyance, bother, trouble''&lt;ref&gt;J. Amyot, Œuvres morales, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; and later as of 1609 was also referred to ''the condition of being exhausted, overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lescarbot, Histoire de la Nouvelle France, I, 479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harassement harassement] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the French verb ''harasser'' itself there are the first records in a Latin to French translation of 1527 of [[Thucydides]]’ [[History of the Peloponnesian War|History of the war]] that was between the [[Peloponnesia]]ns and the [[Athens|Athenians]] both in the countries of the Greeks and the Romans and the neighbouring places wherein the translator writes ''harasser'' allegedly meaning ''harceler'' (to exhaust the enemy by repeated raids); and in the military chant Chanson du [[franc archer]]&lt;ref&gt;The original [https://books.google.com/books?id=hMUFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Chanson+du+franc+archer+%22+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F80UMk0A17&amp;sig=vfOYYDexxIUL2TQgl1cdcaPOpTo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1 text] of the chant&lt;/ref&gt; of 1562, where the term is referred to a gaunt [[wikt:jument|jument]] (''de poil fauveau, tant maigre et harassée'': of fawn horsehair, so meagre and …) where it is supposed that the verb is used meaning ''overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harasser harasser] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothesis about the origin of the verb ''harasser'' is ''harace''/''harache'', which was used in the 14th century in expressions like ''courre à la harache'' (to pursue) and ''prendre aucun par la harache'' (to take somebody under constraint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/academie9/harassant//1 |title=Centre national de ressources textuelles et lexicales |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch]], a German etymological dictionary of the French language (1922–2002) compares phonetically and syntactically both ''harace'' and ''harache'' to the interjection ''hare'' and ''haro'' by alleging a pejorative and augmentative form. The latter was an exclamation indicating distress and emergency (recorded since 1180) but is also reported later in 1529 in the expression ''crier haro sur'' (to arise indignation over somebody). ''hare'' 's use is already reported in 1204 as an order to finish public activities as fairs or markets and later (1377) still as command but referred to dogs. This dictionary suggests a relation of ''haro''/''hare'' with the old lower franconian ''*hara'' (here) (as by bringing a dog to heel).&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haro haro]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pejorative of an exclamation and in particular of such an exclamation is theoretically possible for the first word (''harace'') and maybe phonetically plausible for ''harache'', a semantic, syntactic and phonetic similarity of the verb ''harasser'' as used in the first popular attestation (the chant mentioned above) with the word ''haras'' should be kept in mind: Already in 1160 ''haras'' indicated a group of horses constrained together for the purpose of reproduction and in 1280 it also indicated the enclosure facility itself, where those horses are constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haras haras]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin itself of ''harass'' is thought to be the old Scandinavian ''hârr'' with the Romanic suffix –as, which meant ''grey or dimmish horsehair''. Controversial is the etymological relation to the Arabic word for ''horse'' whose roman [[Romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] is [[Arabian horse|faras]].

Although the French origin of the word 'harassment' is beyond all question in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and those dictionaries basing on it, a supposed Old French verb ''harer'' should be the origin of the French verb ''harasser'', despite the fact that this verb cannot be found in French etymologic dictionaries like that of the [[:fr:Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales|Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales]] or the [[Trésor de la langue française informatisé]] (see also their corresponding websites as indicated in the interlinks); since the entry further alleges a derivation from ''hare'', like in the mentioned German etymological dictionary of the French language a possible misprint of ''harer'' = ''har/ass/er'' = ''harasser'' is plausible or cannot be excluded. In those dictionaries the relationship with ''harassment'' were an interpretation of the interjection ''hare'' as ''to urge a dog to attack', despite the fact that it should indicate a shout to come and not to go (''hare'' = ''hara'' = ''here''; cf. above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/harassment|title=Harassment - Define Harassment at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=harass&amp;searchmode=phrase|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harassment|title=Harass - Definition of harass by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] prudently indicates this origin only as possible.

Electronic harassment is the unproven belief of the use of [[electromagnetic wave]]s to harass a victim. Psychologists have identified evidence of [[auditory hallucination]]s, [[delusional disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=KMIRNews20121112&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |title=Electronic Harassment: Voices in My Mind |last=Monroe |first=Angela |date=November 12, 2012 |newspaper=KMIR News |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213164754/http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |archivedate=February 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[mental disorder]]s in online communities supporting those who claim to be targeted.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Pochechueva.

===Landlord===
{{Main|Landlord harassment}}
Landlord harassment is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].  Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord harassment carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

===Mobile===
{{Main|Mobile harassment}}
Mobile harassment refers to the sending of any type of [[Text messaging|text message]], [[Picture message|photo message]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|video message]], or [[voicemail]] from a [[mobile phone]] that threatens, torments, or humiliates the recipient of these messages. It is a form of [[cyber bullying]].

{{Main|Online harassment}}
Harassment directs multiple repeating obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing photos of the victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media with the aim of causing emotional distress (see [[cyberbullying]], [[cyberstalking]], [[hate crime]], [[online predator]], and [[stalking]]).

===Police===
{{Main|Police harassment}}
Unfair treatment conducted by law officials, including but not limited to [[excessive force]], [[Racial profiling|profiling]], [[Intimidation|threats]], [[coercion]], and racial, ethnic, religious, gender/sexual, age, or other forms of [[discrimination]].

===Power===
{{Main|Power harassment}}
Power harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

===Psychological===
This is humiliating, intimidating or abusive behavior which is often difficult to detect, leaving no evidence other than victim reports or complaints. This characteristically lowers a person’s self-esteem or causes one to have overwhelming torment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annette B. Roter|title=Understanding and Recognizing Dysfunctional Leadership: The Impact of Dysfunctional Leadership on Organizations and Followers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=26 June 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-00517-9|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can take the form of verbal comments, engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures. Falling into this category is workplace harassment by individuals or groups [[mobbing]].

===Racial===
{{Main|Racial harassment}}
The targeting of an individual because of their race or ethnicity. The harassment may include words, deeds, and actions that are specifically designed to make the target feel degraded due to their race or ethnicity.

===Religious===

Verbal, psychological or physical harassment is used against targets because they choose to practice a specific religion. Religious harassment can also include forced and involuntary conversions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Religious terrorism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}{{Further|Sexual harassment in education|Sexual harassment in the military}}

Sexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be an subtle and overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance), implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the [[Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States|workplace]], [[Sexual harassment in education|schools]], and the [[Sexual harassment in the military|military]]. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable. Women are substantially more likely to be affected than men.&lt;ref&gt;Maeve Duggan. PEW Research Center. 2014. "Online Harassment".

===Workplace===
{{Main|Workplace harassment}}
Workplace harassment is the offensive, belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications01/harassment.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, matters of [[workplace]] harassment have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as it is becoming one of the most sensitive areas of effective workplace management. In [[Oriental]] countries, it attracted lots of attention from researchers and governments since the 1980s, because a significant source of work stress is associated with aggressive behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N.

==Laws==
{{globalize|section|date=August 2015}}

===United States===

Harassment, under the laws of the United States, is defined as any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress. In 1964, the United States Congress passed Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] which prohibited discrimination at work on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and sex. This later became the legal basis for early harassment law. The practice of developing workplace guidelines prohibiting harassment was pioneered in 1969, when the U.S. Department of Defense drafted a Human Goals Charter, establishing a policy of equal respect for both sexes. In ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]],'' {{ussc|477|57|1986}}: the U.S. Supreme Court recognized harassment suits against employers for promoting a sexually [[hostile work environment]]. In 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a law which prohibited the transmission of annoying messages over the [[Internet]] (''aka'' [[Spam (electronic)|spamming]]) without disclosing the sender's true identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|author-link=Declan McCullagh|url=http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|title=Create an e-annoyance, go to jail|work=CNET news|date=9 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315091415/http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|archive-date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination ("LAD")====
The LAD prohibits employers from discriminating in any job-related action, including recruitment, interviewing, hiring, promotions, discharge, compensation and the terms, conditions and privileges of employment on the basis of any of the law's specified protected categories. These protected categories are race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex (including pregnancy and sexual harassment), marital status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information, liability for military service, or mental or physical disability, including [[HIV/AIDS]] and related illnesses. The LAD prohibits intentional discrimination based on any of these characteristics. Intentional discrimination may take the form of differential treatment or statements and conduct that reflect discriminatory animus or bias.

===Canada===
In 1984, the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] prohibited sexual harassment in workplaces under federal jurisdiction.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Harassment in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, there are a number of laws protecting people from harassment, including the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] and the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

[[File:Hypervelocity Impact.png|thumb|Hypervelocity impact]]

'''Hypervelocity''' is very high [[velocity]], approximately over 3,000 [[metre per second|meters per second]] (6,700&amp;nbsp;mph, 11,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or [[Mach number|Mach]] 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to [[inertia]]l stresses.&lt;ref Name="AIAA"&gt;{{cite book

Extreme hypervelocity results in [[vaporize|vaporization]] of the [[impact force|impactor]] and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (5,600&amp;nbsp;mph, 9,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 8,200&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or Mach 7.3).  [[Meteorite]] [[impact crater|crater]]s are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.

==Overview==
"Hypervelocity" refers to velocities in the range from a few kilometers per [[second]] to some tens of kilometers per second. This is especially relevant in the field of [[space exploration]] and military use of space, where hypervelocity impacts (e.g. by [[space debris]] or an attacking [[projectile]]) can result in anything from minor component degradation to the complete destruction of a [[spacecraft]] or missile. The impactor, as well as the surface it hits, can undergo temporary [[liquefaction]]. The impact process can generate [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, which can interfere with spacecraft electronics.

Hypervelocity usually occurs during [[meteor shower]]s and deep space reentries, as carried out during the [[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] programs. Given the intrinsic unpredictability of the timing and trajectories of meteors, space capsules are prime data gathering opportunities for the study of thermal protection materials at hypervelocity (in this context, hypervelocity is defined as greater than [[escape velocity]]). Given the rarity of such observation opportunities since the 1970s, the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] and [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] Sample Return Capsule (SRC) reentries as well as the recent [[Hayabusa]] SRC reentry have spawned observation campaigns, most notably at [[NASA Ames Research Center]].

Hypervelocity [[collision]]s can be studied by examining the results of naturally occurring collisions (between [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] and spacecraft, or between meteorites and planetary bodies), or they may be performed in laboratories. Currently the primary tool for laboratory experiments is a [[light-gas gun]], but some experiments have used [[linear motor]]s to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocity. The properties of metals under hypervelocity have been integrated with weapons, such as [[explosively formed penetrator]]. The vaporization upon impact and liquefaction of surfaces allow metal projectiles formed under hypervelocity forces to penetrate vehicle armor better than conventional bullets.

[[NASA]] studies the effects of simulated orbital debris at the [[White Sands Test Facility]] Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL).&lt;ref Name="RHTL"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects smaller than a softball cannot be detected on radar. This has prompted spacecraft designers to develop shields to protect spacecraft from unavoidable collisions. At RHTL, [[micrometeoroid]] and [[orbital debris]] (MMOD) impacts are simulated on spacecraft components and shields allowing designers to test threats posed by the growing orbital debris environment and evolve shield technology to stay one step ahead. At RHTL, four two-stage light-gas guns propel 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm to 22.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter projectiles to velocities as fast as 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==Other definitions of hypervelocity==
According to the [[United States Army]], ''hypervelocity'' can also refer to the [[muzzle velocity]] of a weapon system, with the exact definition dependent upon the weapon in question.  When discussing [[small arms]] a muzzle velocity of 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1524&amp;nbsp;m/s) or greater is considered hypervelocity, while for [[tank]] [[cannons]] the muzzle velocity must meet or exceed 3,350&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1021.08&amp;nbsp;m/s) to be considered hypervelocity, and the threshold for [[artillery]] cannons is 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1066.8&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref Name="DA"&gt;{{cite web

'''Integrated threat theory''', also known as '''intergroup threat theory'''&lt;ref name='stephan2009'&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephan |first=Walter G. |last2=Ybarra |first2=Oscar |last3=Morrison |first3=Kimberly Rios |editor-last=Nelson |editor-first=Todd D. |title=Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination |publisher=Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group| date=2009 |pages=44 |chapter=Intergroup Threat Theory}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] which attempts to describe the components of perceived threat that lead to prejudice between [[social group]]s. The theory applies to any social group that may feel threatened in some way, whether or not that social group is a majority or minority group in their society. This theory deals with perceived threat rather than actual threat. Perceived threat includes all of the threats that members of group believe they are experiencing, regardless of whether those threats actually exist. For example, people may feel their economic well-being is threatened by an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] stealing their jobs even if, in reality, the outgroup has no effect on their job opportunities. Still, their perception that their job security is under threat can increase their levels of prejudice against the outgroup. Thus, even [[false alarm]]s about threat still have “real consequence” for prejudice between groups.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt;

==Original components of the theory==
Integrated Threat Theory was first proposed by Walter G. Stephan and Cookie White Stephan (2000).&lt;ref name="ZZ"&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Stephan, C. W. (2000). An integrated threat theory of prejudice. In Oskamp, S. (Ed.) Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination (pp. 23–45). Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The original theory had four components: realistic threats, symbolic threats, [[intergroup anxiety]], and negative [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="ZZ"/&gt; 

===Realistic threats===

Realistic threats are threats that pose a danger to the in-group’s well-being. These can include threats to physical safety or health, threats to economic and political power, and threats to the existence of the group. This component was originally developed as a part of [[realistic conflict theory]] by Donald T. Campbell (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.T. (1965). Ethnocentric and Other Altruistic Motives. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. pp. 283–311.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Symbolic threats===

Symbolic threats arise where there is a perceived difference between the values and worldview of an [[ingroup and outgroup]]. The difference can make the ingroup feel that the outgroup poses a threat to their group morals, standards, beliefs, and attitudes. These threats are thus strongly tied to a group’s sense of identity. The category was derived from [[Gordon Allport]]’s discussion of the relationship between one’s values and one’s identity. He proposed that, since values are important to who we are, we will reject other groups that disagree with our values.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. (1954) The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also based on the research of Esses and colleagues (1993), who found that groups had more negative feelings towards an outgroup if that outgroup interfered with the in-group’s customs.&lt;ref&gt;Esses V., Haddock G., and Zanna M. (1993) Values, stereotypes, and emotions as determinants of intergroup attitudes. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166) San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergroup anxiety===

Intergroup anxiety refers to the expectation that interacting with someone from a different group will be a negative experience. People with intergroup anxiety fear that they will feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, unsafe, or judged, either by members of the outgroup or by people of their own in-group. 
Before creating the Integrated Threat Theory framework, Stephan &amp; Stephan had been conducting research on intergroup anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W.G. &amp; Stephan, C.W. (1985) Intergroup Anxiety. Journal of Social Issues, 41, 157-175. &lt;/ref&gt; The concept of intergroup anxiety also draws from Aversive Racism Theory, which argues that subconscious negative feelings about Black Americans are an important part of racism against them.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, S.L. &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (1986). "The aversive form of racism". In Gaertner, S.L. &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (Eds.), Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism (pp. 61–89). Orlando: Academic Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative stereotypes===

Stereotypes are a strategy of simplifying a complex situation by relying on popular pre-set judgements.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;Stephan, W.G. &amp; Stephan, C.W. (1993) Cognition and affect in stereotyping : parallel interactive networks. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated Threat Theory predicts that negative pre-set judgments about another group can lead to prejudice. 
This component of ITT draws from research that found that belief in negatively-rated stereotypical traits was linked to higher levels of prejudice against the stereotyped group.&lt;ref name="WG"/&gt; Stephan &amp; Stephan (2000) acknowledged that some research has not found links between prejudice and general stereotypes.&lt;ref name="ZZ"/&gt; Thus, it seems that, while general stereotypes assume some positive things about other groups, only the negative aspects of stereotypes are relevant to prejudice.


== Updated two-component theory ==

In 2002, Stephan and Renfro proposed an updated version of the theory which reduced the four components to two basic types: realistic and symbolic threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G., &amp; Renfro, C. L. (2002). The role of threat in intergroup relations. In D. M. Mackie &amp; E. R. Smith (Eds.), From prejudice to inter-group emotions: Differentiated reactions to social groups (pp. 191–207). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The categories of negative stereotypes and intergroup anxiety were removed from the basic framework of the theory because they were found to be better understood as subtypes of threat. They can lead to either realistic or symbolic threats rather than standing as their own separate categories.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt; For example, intergroup anxiety can be based on expectations of physical danger, a realistic threat, as well as on expectations of damage to one’s identity, a symbolic threat.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt; 

===Experimental Support===
Since ITT makes a causal claim that perceived threat causes prejudice, studies using an [[experimental design]] are necessary. Some researchers have taken on this task to experimentally manipulate types of realistic and perceived threat in order to examine if they cause prejudice. For example, Esses and colleagues (1998) and Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out research studies in which they manipulated the research participants’ understanding of economic threat posed by immigrants. Esses and colleagues (1998) had Canadian undergraduate student participants read one of two editorials that were written for the study. One editorial discussed a new group of immigrants with no mention of the job market while the other editorial discussed the same group and emphasized their success in finding jobs despite the scarcity of jobs in Canada. They then studied the effects of perception of economic threat, a type of realistic threat, on attitudes about immigrants and reported willingness to help immigrants. Results showed that participants that read the editorial that emphasized competition had less favorable attitudes towards immigrants and were less likely to approve of programs to empower immigrants &lt;ref name="Esses"&gt;Esses, V.M., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (1998). Intergroup competition and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration: An instrumental model. Journal of Social Issues, 54, 699-724.&lt;/ref&gt; Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out similar experiments with very similar editorials. Their results showed that participants that read articles that emphasized the tough job market had more negative attitudes towards the immigrants, were less supportive of their immigration into Canada, and were less supportive of programs to empower immigrants. &lt;ref name="VM"&gt;Esses, V.M., Dovidio, J.F., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (2001). The immigration dilemma: The role of perceived competition, ethnic prejudice, and national identity. Journal of Social Issues, 57, 389-412.&lt;/ref&gt; The data from these research studies provide some support for the causal influence of realistic threat on prejudice against immigrants.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VM"/&gt;

The causal influence of symbolic threat on prejudice was partially explored in a study by Branscombe &amp; Wann (1994), who focused on perceived threat to in-group identity in particular. The participants, undergraduate females from the U.S., answered questionnaires about their levels of pride in their American identity at the beginning of the study. They then  manipulated the participants’ perceived threat to in-group identity using video clips, which either showed an American or a Russian boxer beating the other in a match. After seeing one version of the video, participants completed a questionnaire that measured their desire to distance themselves from the outgroup, in this case, Russians. The results of this study showed that increased perception of threat to in-group identity raises a desire to distance oneself from the out-group. &lt;ref&gt;Branscome, N. &amp; Wann, D. (1994). Collective self esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial. European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, 641-657 &lt;/ref&gt; This provides some experimental evidence that perception of threat to in-group identity may causes greater prejudice towards out-groups. However, further experimental research is necessary in order to more firmly and widely establish the causal role of realistic and symbolic threats in prejudice. 

== Factors that influence levels of perceived threat ==
Several factors can lead to increased or decreased levels of group perceived threat.[such as?]

===Power Dynamics===
The updated ITT theory draws from the findings of [[contact hypothesis]], which claims that it is important to have equality between groups. Power dynamics between two groups are shown to have an influence on how the groups relate to and perceive each other. High-power groups are more likely to influence and threaten other groups. Low-power groups are often vulnerable to the influence and threats of other groups. Thus, low-power groups tend to be on alert and perceive more threats than high power groups do.&lt;ref&gt; Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Corenblum &amp; Stephan (2001) found, for example, that Native Canadians felt more threatened by White Canadians than White Canadians felt about them. &lt;ref&gt; Corenblum, B. &amp; Stephan, WG. (2001).  White fears and native apprehensions: An integrated threat theory approach to intergroup attitudes. ''Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science- Revue Canadienne des Sciences du Comportement, 33,'' 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when high-power groups do perceive threat from another group, they “will react more strongly” than low-power groups.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.
&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely because they have more to lose if the threat is real and have more resources that allow them to counter to such threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups of relatively equal power status can be especially sensitive to feeling threatened if they are in competition with each other for resources, such as jobs. &lt;ref&gt;Garcia, S.M., Torr, A., Gonzales, R. (2006) Ranks and rivals: A theory of competition. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,'' ''32,'' 970-982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) predicted that, the more important group membership is to ingroup members’ sense of personal identity, the more likely those people will feel threatened by and uncomfortable when interacting with other groups. According to this prediction, people with strong in-group identification are likely to be more focused on differences between the groups, thus giving them more motivation to hold negative stereotypes of other groups so that they can believe that their group is the best. &lt;ref name="Stephan"&gt;Stephan, W.G., &amp; Renfro, C.L. (2016). The Role of Threat in Intergroup Relations. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Smith, E.R. (Eds.), From Prejudice to Intergroup Emotions: Differentiated Reactions to Social Groups, (191-207). ProQuest Ebook Central. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
There may be a link between the personal importance of group membership and the larger culture in which the groups live. Collectivistic cultures, for example, place a greater emphasis on the importance of group membership compared to individualistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H.R. &amp; Kitayama, S. (1991). Culture and the Self: Implications for Cognition, Emotion, and Motivation. Psychological Review, 98, 224-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture can also influence perceived threat between groups through the culture’s level of uncertainty avoidance. Hofstede &amp; Bond (1984) define uncertainty avoidance as “the degree to which people feel threatened by ambiguous situations, and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these.”&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. &amp; Bond, M. H., (1984). Hofstede’s Culture Dimensions: An Independent Validation Using Rokeach’s Value Survey. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 15, 417-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) thus suggest that cultures which hold norms and laws as very important are likely to perceive threat from “unfamiliar groups.”&lt;ref name="Stephan"/&gt; Further research on these topics can better inform the role of culture in intergroup relationships.

==Research applications== 
The Integrated Threat Theory has been used in research on various social groups, including immigrants, Muslims, tourists, and more. 

===Immigrants===
Multiple studies on inter-group relations have focused on immigrants. For example, Ward and Masgoret (2006) built upon ITT in combination with the Instrumentive Model of Group Conflict to test a model of attitudes toward immigrants, using participants from New Zealand. These participants filled out questionnaires that measured Multicultural Ideology, Intergroup Anxiety, Contact with Immigrants, Perceived Intergroup Threat, and Attitudes toward Immigrants. The results supported the model, suggesting that increased contact with immigrants and multicultural ideology are related to lower levels of perceived threat from immigrants, which is in turn directly related to more positive attitudes towards immigrants. &lt;ref&gt;Ward, C. &amp; Masgoret, A.M. (2006). An integrative model of attitudes towards immigrants. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 30, 671-682. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Croucher (2013) used the ITT framework to explore reasons that dominant groups in France, Germany, and Great Britain sometimes resist Muslim immigrants’ efforts to assimilate. The data was collected through questionnaires, which included measures for symbolic threats, realistic threats, stereotypes, perception of immigrants’ motivation to assimilate, and multigroup ethnic identity. The results supported the theory that the more that the dominant groups felt threatened by the immigrants, the less they thought that the immigrants wanted to assimilate into their country.&lt;ref&gt; Croucher, S.M. (2013). Integrated threat theory and acceptance of immigrant assimilation: an analysis of Muslim immigration in Western Europe. Communication Monographs, 80, 46-62. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly, Rohmann, Piontkowski, and van Randenborgh (2008) used the ITT framework to examine the relationship between perceived threat and a dominant group’s expectation of an immigrant group’s attitude about acculturation. Their research included two studies, one in which German participants were asked about their expectations of French and Turkish immigrants in Germany and another in which German participants were asked about their expectations of two fictitious groups, based on paragraph-long descriptions. Results from both studies suggest that levels of perceived threat are higher if dominant groups expect that an immigrant group has different attitudes about acculturation than the dominant group does.&lt;ref&gt;Rohmann, A., Piontkowski, U., &amp; van Randenborgh, A. (2008). When attitudes do not fit: discordance of acculturation attitudes as an antecedent of intergroup threat. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 337-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslims===
Tausch, Hewstone, and Roy (2009) examined Muslim relations with Hindus in India. ITT was incorporated into their research in order to examine which factors are important in perceived threat between the minority Muslim and majority Hindu groups of India. Their data was collected through a survey given to both Muslim and Hindu students at the same university, which measured contact quantity, contact quality, perceived relative status of the two groups, realistic threats, symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, preference for social distance, and in-group bias. &lt;ref name= "Tausch"&gt;Tausch, N., Hewstone, M., &amp; Roy, R. (2009). The relationships between contact, status and prejudice: An integrated threat theory analysis of Hindu–Muslim relations in India. Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology, 19, 83-94.&lt;/ref&gt;Results showed that symbolic threat was important for Hindus’ levels of perceived threat while realistic threat was important for Muslims’ levels of perceived threat.&lt;ref name= "Tausch"/&gt; 

Gonzalez and colleagues (2008) carried out similar research in the Netherlands, examining the prejudice of Dutch youth, who are members of the majority, against the Muslim minority in the country. Their data was collected through a questionnaire given to high schoolers in different cities, which measured support for multicultural ideologies, frequency of contact with Muslims, in‐group identification, realistic economic threat, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, K.V., Verkuyten, M.W., Jeroen Poppe, E. (2008). Prejudice towards Muslims in The Netherlands: Testing integrated threat theory. British Journal of Social Psychology, 47, 667-685.&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that prejudicial attitudes were related to higher perception of symbolic threats and more belief in stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; 

Uenal (2016) applied the ITT framework to better understand factors involved in the presence of [[Islamophobic]] conspiracy stereotypes in Europe. The data was collected through an online survey given to German university students which measured [[ambiguity intolerance]], belief in a [[clash of civilizations]], realistic threats, symbolic threats, and levels of education.&lt;ref name="Uenal"&gt; Uenal, F. (2016). The "Secret Islamization" of Europe: Exploring Integrated Threat Theory for Predicting Islamophobic Conspiracy Stereotypes. International Journal Of Conflict And Violence, 10, 94-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguity intolerance was found to be related to increased conspiracy stereotypes through increased perceptions of symbolic threat. Belief in a clash of civilizations was found to be related to higher levels of realistic and symbolic threat and higher levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes. Higher education levels showed the opposite trends, as it was related to lower levels of perceived threat and lower levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Uenal"/&gt;

===Tourists===
Tourism can bring different groups into contact and has thus been the subject of some research on inter-group relations using ITT. For example, Ward and Berno (2011) used ITT and contact hypothesis as theoretical backgrounds for predicting attitudes about tourism in Fiji and New Zealand. They collected data through surveys, which included measures of perceived impact of tourism, contact with tourists, the four aspects of the original ITT, and attitudes towards tourists.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt; Ward, C. &amp; Berno, T. (2011). Beyond social exchange theory: Attitudes towards tourists. Annals of Tourism Research, 38, 1556-1569. &lt;/ref&gt; Following the expectations of ITT, the data showed that lower levels of perceived realistic threat, symbolic threat, and intergroup anxiety, and more positive stereotypes were useful predictors of positives attitudes about tourism.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt; Monterubio (2016) applied ITT in studying negative attitudes towards spring break tourists in Cancun, Mexico. Data was collected through interviews with Cancun residents, which included questions about the social impact of spring break and attitudes towards spring breakers.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Monterrubio, C. (2016). The impact of spring break behaviour: An integrated threat theory analysis of residents' prejudice. Tourism Management, 54, 418-427.&lt;/ref&gt; Transcripts of these interviews were then analyzed for themes, including the four components of the original ITT. The results suggested that realistic threats and intergroup anxiety were relevant aspects of prejudice against spring break tourists, largely because of the influence of their behavior.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; 

==Critique of the theory==
Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) updated ITT into the two-factor model and admitted that “ultimately, the model is circular.” The theory states that perceived threat leads to prejudice but the outcomes of that prejudice itself can also lead into increased perceived threat.&lt;ref name="Stephan"/&gt; 

[[Anxiety/Uncertainty Management]] Theory counters the way that ITT conceptualizes anxiety as harmful for relationships between social groups. Instead, it understands anxiety as helpful for leading to more effective communication between groups. &lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. D. (1995). Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: Current status. International and intercultural communication annual, 19, 8-58. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate Vrijmoet''' is an American artist who lives and works in [[Seattle]].

== Biography ==
Kate Vrijmoet began formal art studies at [[Moore College of Art]], Philadelphia, taking weekend classes while attending high school  (1982–1983). She went on to study at the [[Crouse College, Syracuse University|School of Visual and Performing Arts]] at [[Syracuse University]], and was invited to teach there in 1994, earning her [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1997. She studied [[painting]] with Evelina Brozgul at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Art|School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 2004 and with Richard Ryan at [[Boston University]] from 2005 to 2006. After recognition in [[New York City]] for her project, ''50 Paintings in 50 Days'',&lt;ref name="Harlem50"&gt;Susan Macura (November 2008) "50 Paintings in 50 Days" ''Harlem Valley Times''&lt;/ref&gt; her work was curated into a group show &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For the Love of Art|url=http://yametonart.com/2009/02/02/for-the-love-of-art-kate-vrijmoet.aspx|work=Penrick Collections|accessdate=August 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207053329/http://yametonart.com/2009/02/02/for-the-love-of-art-kate-vrijmoet.aspx|archivedate=February 7, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving press in the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYTimes09"&gt;Susan Hodara (February 8, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/nyregion/westchester/08lovewe.html ''A Show of Heartfelt, Diverse Works''], Sunday ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[The Journal News|New York Journal News]]''.&lt;ref name="NYJournal09"&gt;Georgette Gouveia (Saturday, February 14, 2009), [http://www.hvcca.org/press/Gouveia1.pdf "For the Love of Art in Peekskill: Making money isn't the artist’ top priority at this juried show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126214444/http://hvcca.org/press/Gouveia1.pdf |date=2011-01-26 }}, ''The Journal News''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 she had her first solo exhibition at the Center on Contemporary Art CoCA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocaseattle.org|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoCA10"&gt;CoCA (February 2010), [https://web.archive.org/web/20100406162106/http://www.cocaseattle.org/archive2010.html ''Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures'']&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, and was reviewed in the ''[[Seattle Times]]''.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes10"&gt;Michael Upchurch (February 18, 2010), [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2011117780_coca19.html ''Review: Abstract, figurative collide in Vrijmoet paintings''], ''Seattle Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Her painting, ''Shotgun Accident''&lt;ref name="PressRelease10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katevrijmoet.com/main-menu-pages/blog/seattle-artist-kate-vrijmoet-wins-a-top-award-at-ecuadorean-pain/|title=Kate Vrijmoet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; won third place in the 2010 Ecuador Biennale of Painting,&lt;ref name="Ecuador10"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pup_aQgsLug&amp;feature=player_embedded!|title=Clausura de la II Bienal de Pintura 23 Junio 2010|date=24 June 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision that has recently caused controversy according to the Ecuador newspaper ''El Telégrafo'', which reported that many considered Vrijmoet the rightful first-place winner.&lt;ref name="El Telégrafo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guayaquil Biennial arrives on the local art scene|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=28726&amp;Itemid=30|work=El Telégrafo|accessdate=June 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112040241/http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=28726&amp;Itemid=30|archivedate=January 12, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecuador Newspaper reports controversy over last Biennale winners|url=http://katevrijmoet.com/main-menu-pages/blog/ecuador-newspaper-reports-controversy-over-last-biennale-winners/|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vrijmoet was one of 16 American artists whose work was included in the 5th [[Beijing International Art Biennale]]. Her painting, "Naked Snow Blower", a part of Vrijmoet's ''Accident's'' series, was exhibited in the [[National Museum of China]] beginning September 28, 2012.  In 2014 she curated the [[Social practice (art)|Social Practice]] Art exhibit, "The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katevrijmoet.com/work/curatorial-projects/|title=The incredible intensity of just being human: Exhibit to end the stigma of mental illness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle City Hall, a traveling exhibit aimed at ending the stigma and silence surrounding mental illness.

== Work ==
Through paintings, installations and social art, Vrijmoet focuses on issues of consciousness, scale, accessibility and ownership. A student of anatomy since childhood, Vrijmoet has for three decades included life drawing in her daily practice. She is currently completing her ''Accident'' series and her ''Non-ordinary Reality'' series. In August, 2010, the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle published a 42-page catalog for her solo show, ''Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures''.&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"&gt;CoCA (2010), [http://www.cocaseattle.org/books ''Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224003755/http://www.cocaseattle.org/books/ |date=2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Vrijmoet's work was featured in a [[South Seattle Community College]] showing, and during a solo show at the [[LANN Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museoluisnoboanaranjo.com/eng/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803161246/http://www.museoluisnoboanaranjo.com/eng/index.php |archivedate=2010-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]].

Her profile was featured in the inaugural issue of the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' Arts Section.&lt;ref name="Huffington10"&gt;Ming Holden (June 18, 2010) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ming-holden/what-does-ecuador-have-to_b_607046.html ''What Does Ecuador Have to Do with Seattle?''] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Kate discuses her work in detail in an interview published by the science and culture digest [[3 Quarks Daily]].&lt;ref name="3 Quarks Daily"&gt;Elatia Harris (September 13th, 2010) [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/09/kate-vrijmoet-a-non-ordinary-trajectory-.html 'Kate Vrijmoet: A Non-ordinary Painting Trajectory']&lt;/ref&gt; In her exhibit book, The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human[14], she writes, "Art connects us. It tells us we're human, we're like one another, we feel the same emotions. My mission as a human being, and my job as an artist, is to use art to create deep connections among us. Those deep connections already exist, but sometimes convention rewards us for ignoring them. I contend that the greater rewards come from exploring them.".

In 2011 Vrijmoet's installation piece ''"Mother May I…?"'' was exhibited at the Orange County Center on Contemporary Arts (OCCCA),in a show that was endorsed by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], who coined the term relational aesthetics, or [[Relational art]]. In 2012 this installation was featured in the largest artist-run, not for profit organization in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Artists Waterfront Coalition's (BWAC) juried show. ''"Mother May I…?,"'' — an interactive audio installment designed to address our fundamental sense of belonging — was awarded "Best Installation" by Charlotta Kotik, curator of the [[Brooklyn Museum]] of Art. Vrijmoet's work has featured in New York City shows juried by curators of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (Anne Strauss), the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] (Nat Trotman), and [[Museum of Modern Art]] (Paulina Pobocha).

In 2013 she began curating a [[Social Practice Art]] exhibit aimed at ending the stigma and silence surrounding mental illness. The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human has been exhibited at the [[Seattle Center]], and [[Highline College]]. In 2014 she won prestigious grants through [[Artist Trust]] and Seattle Department of Neighborhoods to further fund this exhibit in [[Seattle City Hall]] where civic leaders [[Ed Murray (Washington politician)|Mayor Ed Murray]], [[Randy Revelle]], [[Brady Walkinshaw]], and [[Tina Orwall]] spoke at the opening reception about mental illness. Vrijmoet's project was supported by Seattle Office of Arts and Culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/arts/|title=Office of Arts &amp; Culture – Seattle – Arts – seattle.gov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allied Arts of Seattle|Allied Arts Foundation]].

Also in 2013 she participated in [[Seattle Erotic Art Festival|SEAF]] with her social sculpture "Poor Impulse Control"- an example of [[relational art]], social sculpture, or ironic participation. In this form the artist exploits the role of the viewer as the art object.  The primary role of social sculpture is not one of beauty, but of intervention through discomfort. The audience has an interdependent relationship with the work. Of this social sculpture Vrijmoet writes, "The collapse of the emotional and physical boundaries inherent to the human experience is a recurrent theme in my work. [...] my work directly engages participants communally, even as it remains distinctly personal to each audience member. Although initiated by a single creator, audience participation is fundamental to making my work come to life."

In the catalog essay of her CoCA solo exhibit, "Essential Gestures", Elatia Harris writes of her work, "Any single image from the ''Accident'' series will freeze you where you stand. Motionlessly, you check yourself for parts and think, ''Oh, that's the thing, the thing that happened to me, even if no one sees it''. The Water paintings, on the other hand, will dislocate you – you are pulled, plunged and buoyed, seeing up and through and down."&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"/&gt; Maine writer and art critic, Dan Kany, writes Vrijmoet's work takes a "supremely anti-modernist stance – following the idea that [[Modernism]] doesn't privilege the artist/author over the viewer."&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"/&gt; A show of her ''Accident'' Series Paintings was exhibited in 2013 at [[Columbia Basin College]]'s Esvelt Gallery in [[Eastern Washington]].

In 2014 she published an article The Broader Economic Impact of Donating Your Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katevrijmoet.com/blog/broader-economic-implications-donating-your-art/|title=The broader economic implications of donating your art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that went viral on social media outlets and was viewed more than 2 million times across the globe.&lt;ref name="The broader economic impact of donating your art"&gt;Kate Vrijmoet (March 2014)' Omphaloskepsis&lt;/ref&gt; This article continues to inspire dialog surrounding fundraising in the arts.

In 2015 Vrijmoet participated in The [[Richard Siken]] Project, in which 11 artists respond to The War of the Foxes, through [[Copper Canyon Press]].

In [[set theory]], the '''kernel''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' may be taken to be either

*the [[equivalence relation]] on the function's [[domain of a function|domain]] that roughly expresses the idea of "equivalent as far as the function ''f'' can tell",&lt;ref name="bergman"&gt;{{citation|title=Universal Algebra: Fundamentals and Selected Topics|series=Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=301|first=Clifford|last=Bergman|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781439851296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXi3BZWoMRwC&amp;pg=PA14|pages=14–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or
*the corresponding [[partition of a set|partition]] of the domain.

==Definition==
For the formal definition, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and let ''f'' be a function from ''X'' to ''Y''.
Elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' are ''equivalent'' if ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[equal (math)|equal]], i.e. are the same element of ''Y''.
The kernel of ''f'' is the equivalence relation thus defined.&lt;ref name="bergman"/&gt;

==Quotients==
Like any equivalence relation, the kernel can be [[Ideal (ring theory)|modded out]] to form a [[quotient set]], and the quotient set is the partition:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\, \left\{\, w \in X \mid f(x)=f(w) \,\right\}  \mid x \in X \,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This quotient set {{math|''X''}} /={{math|&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is called the ''[[coimage]]'' of the function {{math|''f''}}, and denoted {{math|coim ''f''}} (or a variation).
The coimage is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] (in the set-theoretic sense of a [[bijection]]) to the [[image (mathematics)|image]], {{math|im ''f''}}; specifically, the [[equivalence class]] of {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}} (which is an element of {{math|coim ''f''}}) corresponds to {{math|''f''(''x'')}} in {{math|''Y''}} (which is an element of {{math|im ''f''}}).

==As a subset of the square==
Like any [[binary relation]], the kernel of a function may be thought of as a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''X''.
In this guise, the kernel may be denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation) and may be defined symbolically as

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker} f := \{(x,x') \mid f(x) = f(x')\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="bergman"/&gt;

The study of the properties of this subset can shed light on {{math|''f''}}.

==In algebraic structures==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[algebraic structure]]s of some fixed type (such as [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (algebra)|ring]]s, or [[vector space]]s), and if the function ''f'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a [[homomorphism]], then ker ''f'' will be a [[subalgebra]] of the [[direct product]] ''X'' × ''X''. Subalgebras of ''X'' × ''X'' that are also equivalence relations (called ''[[congruence relation]]s'') are important in [[abstract algebra]], because they define the most general notion of [[quotient algebra]].&lt;ref name="bergman"/&gt; Thus the coimage of ''f'' is a quotient algebra of ''X'' much as the image of ''f'' is a subalgebra of ''Y''; and the bijection between them becomes an [[isomorphism]] in the algebraic sense as well (this is the most general form of the [[first isomorphism theorem]] in algebra). The use of kernels in this context is discussed further in the article [[Kernel (algebra)]].

==In topological spaces==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological space]]s and ''f'' is a [[continuous function]] between them, then the topological properties of ker ''f'' can shed light on the spaces ''X'' and ''Y''.
For example, if ''Y'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], then ker ''f'' must be a [[closed set]].
Conversely, if ''X'' is a Hausdorff space and ker ''f'' is a closed set, then the coimage of ''f'', if given the [[quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] topology, must also be a Hausdorff space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8111">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Langue'' and ''parole''}}
'''''Langue''''' ([[French language|French]], meaning "[[language]]") and '''''parole''''' (meaning "[[speaking]]") are [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms distinguished by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]''. ''Langue'' encompasses the abstract, systematic rules and conventions of a [[signifying system]]; it is independent of, and pre-exists, individual users. ''Langue'' involves the principles of language, without which no meaningful utterance, "parole", would be possible.  ''Parole'' refers to the concrete instances of the use of ''langue''.  This is the individual, personal phenomenon of language as a series of [[speech acts]] made by a linguistic subject.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). Course in general linguistics (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure did not concern himself overly with ''parole''; however, the structure of ''langue'' is revealed through the study of ''parole''. The distinction is similar to that made about language by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], between ''energeia'' (active doing) and ''ergon'' (the product of that doing)&lt;ref&gt;"Language as a finished product, a set of tools forged for future use, is in fact a precipitate of the ongoing activity. It is created in speech, and is in fact being continuously recreated, extended, altered, reshaped. This Humboltdian notion is the basis for another famous contribution of Saussure, his distinction between ''langue'' and ''parole''." Charles Taylor, ''The Importance of Herder'', "Philosophical Arguments" (Harvard University Press, 1997), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the distinction between ''language'' and ''speech'' made by [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin de Courtenay (1876–7), ''A detailed programme of lectures for the academic year 1876-77'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure drew an analogy to chess to explain the concept of ''langue'' and ''parole''. He compared ''langue'' to the [[rules of chess]]—the norms for playing the game—and compared the moves that an individual chooses to make—the individual's preferences in playing the game—to the ''parole''.

==Langue==
When translated from the [[French language|French]] term ''langue'' can mean language. However, it is known Saussure intended the term to mean internal, arrangement and relationship of rules understood by a social group, however, rarely thought of in everyday life. ''Langue'' is believed to be a universal structure and, while it may have variations as seen in foreign languages, with principal linguistic patterns.

==Parole==
''Parole'' typically when it is translated means speech. Saussure, on the other hand, intended for it to mean both the written and spoken language as experienced in everyday life. It is the precise utterances and use of ''langue''. Therefore, ''parole'', unlike ''langue'', is as diverse and varied as the number of people who share a language and the number of utterances and attempts to use that language. Furthermore, ''parole'' is known to have been changed and manipulated by a number of causes for example time, social groups, and age of users.

==As a function==
The underlying basis to ''langue'' is the interpretation that it is made up of signs and not sentences. Signs are thought to have a two part aspect in that each sign relates a notion with a sound pattern (or a written symbol). A sign cannot exist as a single part for if there is a sound pattern without a notion the sound becomes only noise. Similarly, a notion cannot be communicated without a sound pattern.
The sound pattern for each notion can be extremely diverse and vice versa. For example, the notion of oneself may use the sound patterns of 'I' or 'me' while the sound pattern of 'rose' may have the notion of a flower or the past of 'rise'. The notion or sound pattern remains unchanged even if the other changes. It is by understanding the relationship of the two parts of a sign through ''langue'' that the gist of communication or ''parole'' may be understood. Without the understanding of ''langue'', ''parole'' would be meaningless sounds or symbols grouped together haphazardly.
Saussure used the example of chess to explain how ''langue'' and ''parole'' work together. ''Langue'' is the normative rules in a chess game while parole represents the individual's choice of moves. If one were to study the parole of a chess game an understanding could be derived but it would not be a universal understanding of chess. However, by studying the langue of a chess game the derived understanding may be applicable to further chess games.
Thus Saussure argued when studying language, especially a foreign language, it is more important to understand the ''langue'' than to gain a large vocabulary of ''parole'' so that sense may be made equal to that of native speaker.

==Course in general linguistics==
Saussure did not publish his notes in relation to linguistics and ''langue'' and ''parole''. Unfortunately Cours de linguistique générale was published after his death in 1916 (later translated into English in 1959 as ''Course in General Linguistics'') and was made up of remaining lecture notes by Saussure, course notes provided to students and notes taken by former students of his lectures he performed between 1907-1911 in Geneva. This was then published by two of his former colleagues Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was after this publication that the importance and revolutionary nature of his work truly was understood by linguists and philosophers of his time.
Reviews, commentaries and critics of both the ''Course in General Linguistics'' and original notes made by Saussure have revealed much controversy over time. One controversy is that many ideas and notions often accredited to Saussure may have been borrowed from other linguists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Saussure's idea of language as a sign system had been proposed by other philosophers, however, he will always be known to have provided a strong, theoretical basis for a scientific approach to understanding language as a whole.

==Influence==
Saussure's ''langue'' and ''parole'' form one of the theoretical foundations of structuralism. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have allowed structuralists to separately examine the broad structures and formations of literature as well as the individual words. Structuralists achieved this by making a distinction within literary works between the words on a page (''parole'') and the context behind these words (''langue''). Although the reader may appear to simply be reading the words in a book their ability to understand (or possibly misunderstand) the text is a result of a person's knowledge of the ''langue'' or rules of a certain language. Similarly, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been highly influential in the study of the signs, termed semiotics. Saussure's most notable influence on semiotics was his belief that the rules and codes of a language (''langue'') are vital in interpreting and gaining an understanding of that language system, while individual utterances (''parole'') are of little significance. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have also impacted the way language is taught. Since Saussure's terms have become well known, language teaching often emphasizes teaching the langue and how these rules are applied, rather than simply teaching the words of a certain language. Additionally, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been applied to other fields of study. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used Structuralism and ''langue'' and ''parole'' to understand myths and tales within a broader context. In this case parole is a single tale or myth, while langue is considered the broader range of tales and myths from within a series or group. These may be myths from the same community, time period or geographical location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9891">{{Competition law}}
In [[economics]] and particularly in [[industrial organization]], '''market power''' is the ability of a [[theory of the firm|firm]] to profitably raise the [[market price]] of a good or service over [[marginal cost]]. In [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Market participants that have market power are therefore sometimes referred to as "price makers" or "price setters", while those without are sometimes called "price takers". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and [[long run average cost]], so the firm makes profit.

A firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping [[demand curve]], such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic [[deadweight loss]] which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have [[anti-trust]] or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates [[merger]]s and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel [[divestiture]].

A firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—[[monopoly]] and [[monopsony]]—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly [[Market concentration|concentrated markets]] may be [[contestable market|contestable]] if there are no [[barriers to entry]] or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels.

Market power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vatiero Massimiliano|year=2010|title=The Ordoliberal notion of market power: an institutionalist reassessment|doi=10.5235/ecj.v6n3.689|journal=European Competition Journal|volume=6|issue=3|pages=689–707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the behaviours that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include [[predatory pricing]], product [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], and creation of [[Capacity utilization|overcapacity]] or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through [[collusion]], or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power.

The [[Lerner index]] and [[Herfindahl index]] may be used to measure market power.

==Oligopoly==
When several firms control a significant share of market sales, the resulting market structure is called an [[oligopoly]] or [[oligopsony]].  An oligopoly may engage in [[collusion]], either tacit or overt, and thereby exercise market power. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a [[cartel]].

==Monopoly power==
[[Monopoly power]] is an example of [[market failure]] which occurs when one or more of the participants has the ability to influence the [[price]] or other outcomes in some general or specialized [[Market (economics)|market]].  The most commonly discussed form of market power is that of a [[monopoly]], but other forms such as [[monopsony]], and more moderate versions of these two extremes, exist.

A well-known example of monopolistic market power is [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] market share in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] [[operating system]]s. The ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its [[web browser]] with its operating system.  &lt;!-- A well-known example of monopoly market power is [[Standard Oil]], an oil refining company that held about 90% of the refining capacity in the U.S before it was split up by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1911, but I don't know enough about how Rockefeller abused its market power to use the example. --&gt;
In this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Vatiero M. (2009), "An Institutionalist Explanation of Market Dominances". World Competition. Law and Economics Review, 32(2):221–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source==
A monopoly can raise prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer has no other place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without.&lt;ref&gt;If the power company raised rates the customer either pays the increase or does without power.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Krugman &amp; Wells, Microeconomics 2d ed. (Worth 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[OPEC]] is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources&amp;nbsp;— oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms in such industries become more profitable with size.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for start up firms to succeed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large start up costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Often such natural monopolies will also have the benefit of government granted monopolies.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.

==Measurement==
Concentration ratios are the most common measures of market power.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The four-firm concentration ratio measures the percentage of total industry output attributable to the top four companies. For monopolies the four firm ratio is 100 per cent while the ratio is zero for perfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The four firm concentration domestic (U.S) ratios for cigarettes is 93%; for automobiles, 84% and for beer, 85%.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another measure of concentration is the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] (HHI) which is calculated by "summing the squares of the percentage market shares of all participants in the market".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The HHI index for perfect competition is zero; for monopoly, 10,000.

U.S. courts almost never consider a firm to possess market power if it has a market share of less than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak &amp; Hal J. Singer, ''Überregulation Without Economics: The World Trade Organization’s Decision in the U.S.-Mexico Arbitration on Telecommunications Services, General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS'', 57 FED. COMM. L.J. 1, 34 (2004), http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&amp;context=fclj.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elasticity of demand==
Market power is the ability to raise price above [[marginal cost]] (MC) and earn a positive profit.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 369. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which a firm can raise price (P) above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at the profit maximizing output.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; That is, elasticity is the critical factor in determining market power. The relationship between market power and the [[price elasticity of demand]] (PED) can be summarized by the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{MC}=\frac{PED}{1+PED}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that PED will be negative, so the ratio is always greater than one. The higher the P/MC ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the P/MC ratio approaches one, and market power approaches zero.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:

[[Image:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by the 19th-century [[England|English]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]. Traditional English fairytales depicting [[elves]], [[fairy|fairies]] and [[pixie]]s are set on a "Merrie England" setting of woodland and cottage gardens.]]

"'''Merry England'''", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "'''Merrie England'''" (also styled as "'''Merrie Olde England'''"), refers to an [[England|English]] [[autostereotype]], a [[utopia]]n conception of [[English culture|English society and culture]] based on an [[idyll]]ic [[pastoral]] way of life that was allegedly prevalent in [[Early Modern Britain]] at some time between the [[Middle Ages]] and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. More broadly, it connotes a putative [[essentialism|essential]] [[Englishness]] with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such [[cultural icon|cultural symbols]] as the [[thatched cottage]], the [[country inn]] and the [[Sunday roast]].

"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which [[Oxford]] [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" ''Folklore'' '''102'''.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental [[nostalgic]] imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of ''Merry England'' originated in the Middle Ages, when [[Henry of Huntingdon]] around 1150 first coined the phrase ''Anglia plena jocis''.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], who claimed that "England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Ronald Hutton]]'s study of churchwardens' accounts&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700''.&lt;/ref&gt; places the real consolidation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, [[boy bishop]]s and decorated [[rood loft]]s. Hutton argued that, far from being [[Paganism|pagan survivals]], many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: "Merry England" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hodgkinson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/17/merryenglandwasrealenough 17 November 2006] - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The same concept ''may'' have also been used to describe a [[utopia]]n state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see [[Cockaigne]]).{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} Peasant revolts, such as those led by [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]] invoked a [[visionary]] idea that was also [[egalitarian]] – [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] arguing for "wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. B. Bury ed, ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term "[[Norman yoke]]" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom.  The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – [[Lawrence Stone]] describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (London 1979) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''Th stripping of the Altars'' (London 1992) p. 42;L. Marcus, ''The Politic of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game”&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 95, p. 192 and p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. [[William Langland|Langland]] might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a ''Hey-nonny-nonny''”.&lt;ref&gt;J. F Goodridge ed., ''Piers the Ploughman'' (Penguin 1966) p. 41 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The wandering scholar, or [[goliard]], who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose,&lt;ref&gt;H. Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking,&lt;ref&gt;D. Baker ed., ''The Early Middle Ages'' (London 1966) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Berners, quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, [[mummers]], morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers,&lt;ref&gt;S Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (London 2005) pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly ''merriment'' in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the [[Black Death]] when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and [[serfdom]] was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''History of England'' (London 1926) pp. 242, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the "lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days",&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Alatars'' (London 1992) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, ''1599'' (London 2005) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400–1700'' (Oxford 1994) Ch II. For methodological criticism, see however Katherine L. French, ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1995), 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and including such customs as [[Parish ale|church ales]], may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

However a reaction quickly set in, [[John Caius]] in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called "the old world, when this country was called merry England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; James I in 1618 issued his [[Book of Sports]], specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service;&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of "Merry England" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War.  Unsurprisingly, the [[Long Parliament]] put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove [[Christmas]] underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural revivals==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Gate of Calais|O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais)]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] contrasts English plenty with French and Jacobite Highlander misery.]]

At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving illustrating the patriotic song "[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]" (''see illustration''), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

[[William Hazlitt]]'s essay "Merry England", appended to his ''Lectures on the English Comic Writers'' (1819),&lt;ref&gt;It was often reprinted in collections of Hazlitt's essays, and, tellingly, included in Ernest Rhys' compilation of sentimental patriotism ''The Old Country: a Book of  Love and Praise of England'', first published in  1917, as the First World War was coming to an end, and republished in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an [[allusion]] to the iconic figure of [[Robin Hood]], under the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] "St George for merry England!":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of [[Sherwood Forest|'Merry Sherwood']], and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to ''Merry England''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England'' (1844: translated as ''The Condition of the Working Class in England''), [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote sarcastically of [[Young England]] (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore "the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ..."  The phrase "merry England" appears in English in the German text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_486.htm|title=Friedrich Engels - Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England - Die Stellung der Bourgeoisie zum Proletariat|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CRANE a garland for mayday 1895.jpg|thumb|left|"A Garland for May Day 1895" woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

[[William Cobbett]] provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and ''mores'' of an industrialising nation&lt;ref&gt;William Sambrook, ''William Cobbett'' (1973), ch. I "Merry England?"&lt;/ref&gt; by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] also subscribed to some extent to the "Merry England" view. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' by [[Thomas Love Peacock]]  contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social  unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. "Hurrah for Merry England", was set twice to music and printed in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the [[Gothic revival]] promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—"Norman" for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], "[[Early English Period|Early English]]", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically ''English'' style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named "[[Jacobethan]]". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by [[Joseph Nash]] (1839–1849), illustrating ''The Mansions of England in the Olden Time'' in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and [[farthingale]]s, who personified a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.

Children's storybooks and [[fairytales]] written in the [[Victorian period]] often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as [[elves]] and [[fairy|fairies]], as well as [[Robin Hood]]. In popular culture, the adjective ''Dickensian'' is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but [[Charles Dickens]]'s view of the rural past evoked [[nostalgia]], not [[fantasy]]. [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]]'s world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the [[stagecoach]] before the advent of the [[railway]]s.

The London-based [[Anglo-Catholic]] magazine of prose and verse ''Merry England'' began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by [[William Wordsworth]] as epigraph, beginning "They called thee 'merry England' in old time" and characterizing ''Merry England'' "a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief":
&lt;poem&gt;
'''...Can, I ask,'''
    This face of rural beauty be a mask
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime?—
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?—
    Forbid it, Heaven! —that Merry England still
    May be they rightful name, in prose or rhyme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late Victorian era, the Tory [[Young England]] set perhaps best reflected the vision of "Merry England" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to [[political conservatism]], the vision of "Merry England" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane [[clergy]]; an interested and [[altruism|altruistic]] [[Squire#Present status (England)|squirearchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[royal family|royalty]]. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of [[yeoman farmer]]s, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s and [[Catholicism]], as a version of life's generosity; for example [[Alice Meynell|Wilfrid Meynell]] entitled one of his magazines ''Merrie England''. The pastoral aspects of [[William Blake]], a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. [[G. K. Chesterton]] in part adapted it to urban conditions. [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and other left-inclined improvers. [[Walter Crane]]'s "Garland for May Day 1895"  is lettered "Merrie England" together with progressive slogans ("Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life", "The Land for the People", "No Child Toilers") with socialism ("Production for Use Not for Profit"). For a time, the ''Merry England'' vision was a common reference point for rhetorical [[Tories]] and utopian [[socialist]]s, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross [[social inequality]].
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the ''Clarion'', in his booklet ''Merrie England'' (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably {{what?|date=November 2018}} more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. 

Another variant of ''Merry England'' was promoted in the ''organic community'' of [[F. R. Leavis]] by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan R. R. (1979) ''The Literary Criticism if F. R. Leavis'' (Cambridge University Press) pages 14–18, {{ISBN|978-0-521-22324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve "this hard core of Merriment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.&lt;ref&gt;D.

In Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding "[[Little Englander|Little England]]" during the [[Second World War]] in ''The Myth of the Blitz'', he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime [[propaganda]] operations within the [[United Kingdom]], and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster [[J. B. Priestley]] whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime [[BBC]] radio "chats" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in its [[London Underground|Underground]] stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars." (Angus Calder, ''The Myth of the Blitz'', London 1991)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in ''Journey Through England'', Priestley identified himself as a [[Little Englander]] because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song "[[There'll Always Be an England]]" seems to be derived from the same source:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a country lane,
:Wherever there's a cottage small
:Beside a field of grain.

The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a busy street,
:Wherever there's a turning wheel,
:A million marching feet.

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

Some of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalism]] which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology.  However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of ''Merry England'' to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet [[William Blake]] to the evangelical Christian [[Arthur Mee]]. The [[Rudyard Kipling]] of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. The 1890 [[News from Nowhere]] by [[William Morris]] portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Betjeman]] (more interested in [[Victoriana]]), and the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whose [[hobbit]] characters' culture in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]", [[Michael Moorcock]] opined:

{{quote|The little hills and woods of that [[Surrey]] of the mind, [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], are 'safe', but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond the Shire are 'dangerous'. Experience of life itself is dangerous. The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a declining nation with a [[morally bankrupt]] class whose cowardly self-protection is primarily responsible for the problems England answered with the ruthless logic of [[Thatcherism]]. Humanity was derided and marginalised. Sentimentality became the acceptable substitute. So few people seem to be able to tell the difference.}}

Here the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region within [[Middle-earth]], but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', both [[Gandalf]] and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in ''Concerning Hobbits'' the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness.  Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Furthermore, in the chapters "Homeward Bound" and "The Scouring of the Shire" of Tolkien's "The Return of the King" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as "This is worse than Mordor." Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where "The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture."

''[[The Pyrates]]'', the 1983 spoof historical novel by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]]:
{{quote|It began in the old and golden days of England, in a time when all the hedgerows were green and the roads dusty, when hawthorn and wild roses bloomed, when big-bellied landlords brewed October ale at a penny a pint ...}}

The novel ''[[England, England]]'' by [[Julian Barnes]] describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England.  The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's "Merrie England" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; [[The Kinks]] and their leader [[Ray Davies]] crafted ''[[The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as an album "lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions";&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11011|pure_url=yes}} ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'']. Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' also contains similar elements. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs ([[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the band's namesake]] was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' is a [[comic opera]] by [[Edward German]].

[[Richmal Crompton]]'s "William the Bad'" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch',  about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at "the morning of the world", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal.  The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say,  on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. "The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves [[St. George and the Dragon]] ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwilliamnotes.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Just William|author=Pip|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stacey Mitchell''' (1990 – 18 December 2006) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born girl living in [[Australia]] who was murdered at the age of 16, on 18 December 2006, by [[lesbian]] couple Jessica Stasinowsky (born 1985) and Valerie Parashumti (born 1987). She was bludgeoned with a concrete block and [[Strangling|strangled]] with a chain. Her corpse was found in a [[Waste container|wheelie bin]] shortly afterwards. Stasinowsky and Parashumti had known Mitchell for three days, and claimed they murdered her because they found her irritating.&lt;ref name="bbcasia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7282776.stm |title=Jail for Australian kiss killers |publisher=BBC News |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Stacey Mitchell was born in [[Dorset]], [[England]], but emigrated to [[Australia]] at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7148237.stm |title=Women kill 'irritating' teenager |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, she ran away from her family home and stayed with 19-year-old Parashumti and 21-year-old Stasinowsky.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/07/internationalcrime.australia |title=Vampire-obsessed couple jailed for life for 'sexually perverse' murder |work=The Guardian |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parashumti was accused by Stasinowsky of flirting with Mitchell. She planned to kill Mitchell to prove to Stasinowsky she was not attracted to her. The three of them spent the evening drinking [[whisky]] before Parashumti hit Mitchell over the back of the head with a concrete block. Stasinowsky then [[Strangling|strangled]] her with a dog chain. As she lay dying, the two women kissed over her body and filmed her on a [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Earlier attempts to kill Mitchell by Stasinowsky included putting broken glass in her drink and spilling oil on the bathroom floor.&lt;ref name="giggles" /&gt;

==Trial==
The two women were tried at the [[Perth]] Supreme Court. During the trial they "smiled, giggled and whispered at each other".&lt;ref name="giggles"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alana |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/lesbian-murderers-giggle-at-details/story-e6frfkp9-1111115399635 |title=Lesbian murderers giggle at details |publisher=News.com.au |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parashumti's lawyer stated that she had a severe [[personality disorder]] and had grown up with an abusive father. She had also had an obsession with the vampire sub-culture, and a penchant for drinking people's blood since the age of 10.&lt;ref name="bbcasia" /&gt; Parashumti's father had previously been in prison for beating his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=DEADLY WOMEN {{!}} Fatal Attraction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQKgR_OLHF0|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both women pleaded guilty, and revealed that after Mitchell's death, they had visited a hardware store to look for a [[chainsaw]] and some [[spade]]s.&lt;ref name="perthnow1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/why-stacey-was-murdered/story-e6frg13u-1111114947413|title=Why Stacey was murdered|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, both women were sentenced to strict security [[life imprisonment]], with a 24-year minimum term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-03-07/women-jailed-for-24-years-for-murdering-teenage/1065590|title=Women jailed for 24 years for murdering teenage friend|date=7 March 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stasinowsky subsequently appealed her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cardy |first=Todd |url=http://www.news.com.au/news/killer-appeals-24-year-term/story-fna7dq6e-1111115919771 |title=Jessica Stasinowsky appeals 24-year murder sentence |publisher=News.com.au |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appeal was unanimously rejected by the [[Western Australia|WA]] Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/sadistic-killers-sentence-upheld/news-story/dd80ee37ee3a848681d55d41df8a87ef|title=Sadistic killer's sentence upheld|work=NewsComAu|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ross John Haynes, who also lived with them, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for being an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]]. Although he had been fully aware of the plan to kill Mitchell, he agreed to go to his bedroom and listen to music.&lt;ref name="perthnow1"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==

It was discovered in 2009 that the two women were continuing their relationship in prison, reportedly spending up to 90 minutes together on weekdays, and seven hours a day on weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/vampire-killers-to-be-split-vow/story-e6frg12c-1111118111984|title=Vampire killers to be split: vow|newspaper=NewsComAu|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/security-check-for-greenough/news-story/a37414f54670823301b852aa7229e85a|title=Security check for Greenough|newspaper=NewsComAu|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parashumti was consequently moved to a separate prison.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Housemate killer's old charges dropped|url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/22157905/housemate-killers-old-charges-dropped/|accessdate = 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to maintain contact by sending letters, using fellow inmate [[Catherine Birnie]] as a go-between.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/killers-love-letter-discovered-ng-ya-228250|title=Killer's love letter discovered|date=7 December 2009|work=The West Australian|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, three prison officers were injured, following their intervention in a fight involving Parashumti and another inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/prison-officers-injured-in-lesbian-killer-fight-20121113-29a0q.html|title=Prison officers injured in lesbian killer fight|newspaper=WA Today|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Parashumti attempted to escape from prison, but failed to leave the grounds.

'''''On Weights and Measures''''' is a historical, lexical, [[metrological]], and geographical treatise compiled in 392 [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Salamis, Cyprus|Constantia]] by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315&amp;ndash;403). The greater part of the work is devoted to a discussion on ancient Greek and Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|weights and measures]].

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, ''On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius'', National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 11 (note 3). The letter was apparently signed jointly by [[Valentinian II]], emperor of the West, and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], emperor of the East, as well as Theodosius' two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although five fragments of an early Greek version are known to exist, with one entitled περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων (''On Weights &amp; Measures''), added by a later hand,&lt;ref&gt;The Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, as noted by J.E. Dean (ed.), in ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version'', (Chicago 1935), Introduction p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version is the only complete copy that has survived. Partial translations in Armenian and Georgian&lt;ref&gt;Found in the “Shatberd codex” MS. 1141, in the library of the ''Obshchestvo rasprostranenifa gramotnosti sredi gruzin'', Tiflis&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to exist. Its modern title belies its content, as the work also contains important historical anecdotes about people and places not written about elsewhere.

Two manuscripts of ''On Weights and Measures'', written in Syriac on parchment, are preserved at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The older was found in [[Egypt]] and, according to the colophon, was written in the [[Seleucid era]], in "nine-hundred and sixty-[...]" (with the last digit effaced, meaning, that it was written between the years 649 CE–659 CE). The younger manuscript is designated "Or. Add. 14620".&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, [http://www.trismegistos.org/tm/detail.php?tm=115426 ''Catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum''] 2 756 (pp. 717–718)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to attempt a modern publication of Epiphanius' work was [[Paul de Lagarde]] in 1880, who reconstructed the original Syriac text by exchanging it with Hebrew characters,&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Lagarde, ''Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus'', Gootingae 1880&lt;/ref&gt; and who had earlier published excerpts from several of the Greek fragments treating on weights and measures in his ''Symmicta''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Largarde, ''Symmicta'' I, Göttingen 1877, pp. 210–225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a critical edition of the Greek text was published by E.D. Moutsoulas in ''Theologia''.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Moutsoulas, ed., "Epiphanius of Salamis, Concerning Weights and Measures" (Introduction, Commentary, Text and Notes), ''Theologia'', 44 (1973), pp. 157&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part One'''&lt;/small&gt;
In folios [54b–55c], [[Hadrian]]'s journey and arrival in the East is dated "47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem."
*Translations
In folios [47a–49a]; [51d–52a]; [56d–57b] Epiphanius names four major translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]], made in the Greek tongue: the [[Septuagint|LXX]] made by the seventy-two translators, another by [[Aquila of Pontus]], one by [[Theodotion]], and yet another by [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in [[Jericho]], and a sixth in [[Nicopolis]] near Actium. Afterwards, [[Origen]] arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the [[Hexapla]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the [[Book of Genesis]], another two the [[Book of Exodus]], another two the [[Book of Leviticus]], and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]], which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language.
 
In folios [49a–50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the [[Book of Ezra|Books of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (''Paraleipomena'') considered as one book, as were the First and Second [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] (''Book of First and Second Kingdoms'') considered as one book, and the First and Second [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (''Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms'') considered as one book.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Two'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Prominent figures
In spite of Epiphanius' interest in Jewish themes, his narrative often takes on a distorted and stereotypical view of [[Judaism]], based on the dogmas of his persuasion. Still, he is an invaluable source on the lives of people and places that figure highly in Jewish [[Oral tradition|lore]]. In folios [54a–55c]; [55c–55d] Epiphanius treats on the lives of two prominent persons who became [[proselytes]] to the Jewish religion; the one [[Aquila of Pontus|Aquila]] (known also as Onkelos) who was a relation of [[Hadrian]], and whom he made the overseer of Jerusalem's rebuilding around 115 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The other person of interest who is described by him is [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]], also known as ''Sūmkos'' ({{lang-he-n|'''סומכוס'''}}) in rabbinic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Mishnah]] ''Eruvin'' 3:1; ''Baba Metzia'' 6:5; ''Ḥullin'' 5:3 in ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press, 1974; the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b, ''Baba Bathra'' 73a, ''Baba Kamma'' 46a, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus is mentioned as belonging originally to the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] nation, and is said to have converted to Judaism during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Epiphanius, Marcus Aurelius was also called Verus.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently underwent a second [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and became a disciple of [[Rabbi Meir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus belonged to the fifth generation (165&amp;ndash;200 [[Common Era|CE]]) of Rabbinical teachers referred to in the text of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix III, pp. 799&amp;ndash;800 {{ISBN|0 19 815402 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor [[Hadrian]] is said to have passed through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] while ''en route'' to Egypt, some 47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Three'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Weights and Measures
Folios [61d–73b] contain a treatise on the known weights and measures used in his day among the [[Jews|Hebrews]], the Greeks and the Romans. He states the equivalent weights for the ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|kab]]'' (''cab''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''kor'',&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equal to 30 ''modii'' (seahs). v. ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 12 (folio 45d). The same is defined in the Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 86b, 105a) as equal to thirty ''seahs'', a capacity equal to about 395.533 cubic centimeters.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''lethekh'' ([[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|Lethek]]), [[Homer (unit)|''homer'']], [[Bath (unit)|''bath'']], ''modius'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''seah'' = lit. "measure"),&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equivalent to the volume of 144 medium-sized eggs (9.6 litres); Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, s.v. '''מודיא''' p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mina (unit)|mina]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''maneh''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 60 (§ 51), 65; a weight in silver that was equal to 100 ''[[denarii|denaria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In folios [62b–62c] Epiphanius distinguishes between "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא כַף'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#12 I Kings 17:12] and "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא חֹפֶן'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0209.htm#8 Exodus 9:8] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#12 Leviticus 16:12]; in the former case it refers to only one handful, but in latter cases it refers to "a measure of two handfuls."&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Four'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]
In folios [73b–75a] Epiphanius gives the names of several cities and places of renown, both in his time and in ancient times, such as: [[Mount Ararat]] (§ 61), Aṭaṭ (§ 62), or what is known as the "threshing floor of the thorn bush" ({{Lang-he-n|'''גרן האטד'''}}), and whose description echoes that of [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Genesis 50:10,&lt;ref&gt;Said to be a place about two miles from the Jordan River, called ''Beth-ḥagla'' (lit. "the place of the circuit").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abarim]] (§ 63); [[Eben-Ezer|Aviʿazar]] (§ 68), or what is ''Eḇen haʿezer'' of [[I Samuel]] 4:1, said to be "fourteen [Roman] miles distant east and north of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a valley"; [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]{{nbsp}}(§ 77); [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] of the sea (§ 78); [[Akko]] (§ 76);  [[Anathoth]] (§ 66); [[Azekah]] (§ 64) - a city in whose time was called Ḥ&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt;warta;&lt;ref&gt;R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], in their book, "Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'' (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: "According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (''lavan''), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (''livanim''), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. ''Le-azek'' in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near [[Eleutheropolis]], identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethel]] (§ 73); [[Ophrah (Taybeh)|Ophrah]] (§ 67); [[Carthage]] (§ 79) - where the [[Canaanites]] had migrated from [[Phoenicia]] and who were called in his day ''Bizakanoi'' (scattered people); [[Petra|Rekem]] (§ 71), [[Jaffa]] (§ 75), [[Jerusalem]]{{nbsp}}(§ 74), ''et al.''

The regnal years of the Caesars as stated by Epiphanius differ slightly in some places from the extant Greek versions. With respect to events in Rome after the reign of [[Pertinax]], both Epiphanius and [[Jerome]] do not mention the ascension of [[Didius Julianus]] after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (''On Weights and Measures'', p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'' from which Jerome had based his ''Chronicon'' and may have used it to construct his own chronologies.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of [[Aemilian]]. It can be adduced from Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Aemilian, who "caused a revolt in Moesia," was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 254&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on [[Josephus]]' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56  in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (20.11.3)&lt;/ref&gt; and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar [[Caligula|Gaius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 1&lt;/ref&gt; Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in [[Suetonius]]' ''De vita Caesarum'' (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Party discipline''' is the ability of a [[parliamentary group]] of a [[political party]] to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership. In [[liberal democracies]], it usually refers to the control that party leaders have over their [[caucus]] members in the [[legislature]]. Party discipline is important for all systems of [[government]] that allow parties to hold [[political power]] because it determines the degree to which the governmental infrastructure will be affected by legitimate political processes.

Breaking party discipline in parliamentary votes can result in a number of penalties such as not being promoted to a cabinet position, and losing other perks of elected office like travel. Disagreement with the party caucus may be so strong that they leave the party to join another parliamentary caucus or become an independent, which is known as [[crossing the floor]]. With party discipline, there is an unwritten rule that pressures parliamentarians to compromise their beliefs if they conflict with the decisions made by the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestlibrary.org/ss11/2007/02/the_pros_and_co.html|title=The pros and cons of party discipline|last=Guay|first=Monique|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many political systems, a member of each party is officially designated or elected as a "[[whip (politics)|whip]]", whose role it is to enforce party discipline.

==Strong party discipline==
{{Quote box
| quote = "It is my will to join the Communist Party of China, uphold the Party's program, observe the provisions of the Party constitution, fulfill a Party member's duties, carry out the Party's decisions, strictly observe Party discipline, guard Party secrets, be loyal to the Party, work hard, fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the Party and the people, and never betray the Party."

The term has a somewhat different meaning in [[Marxist–Leninist]] political systems such as the [[People's Republic of China]].  In this case it refers to administrative sanctions such as fines or expulsion that the Communist Party can impose on its members for actions such as corruption or disagreeing with the party.

Other examples of even stronger party discipline include the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] and the [[French Communist Party]].

Party discipline tends to be strong in countries using the Westminster system, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[India]], in which a vote by the legislature against the government is understood, by convention, to cause the government to "collapse". Thus, it is rare for members to vote against the wishes of their party. Party leaders in such governments often have the authority to expel members of the party who violate the party line.

In countries such as New Zealand, which use the [[mixed member proportionality]] system of voting, party discipline tends to be high. That is especially true for list MPs, who do not represent an electorate. If they do not vote the party line, they risk losing their seat.

==Weak party discipline==
Weak party discipline is usually more frequent in parties of [[notables]] and [[Elite party|elite parties]] than in [[populism|populist]] parties. The centrist [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] and the right-wing parties during the [[French Third Republic]] (1871–1940) all had no party discipline.

In the [[United States]], the modern [[US Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and [[US Republican Party|Republican Party]] both have weak party discipline, but that varies somewhat between states. That is aptly illustrated by the vote on the federal [[Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act]], in which the only senator to vote against overriding President [[Barack Obama]]'s veto was the retiring Democratic minority leader [[Harry Reid]].

Humans experience stress, or perceive things as threatening, when they do not believe that their resources for coping with obstacles (stimuli, people, situations, etc.) are enough for what the circumstances demand. When people think the demands being placed on them exceed their ability to cope, they then perceive stress.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"&gt;

==Popular conflation of types==
A very much overlooked side of stress is its positive adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= C.|date= 2012 |title= Stress, positive psychology and the National Student Survey |journal= Psychology Teaching Review |volume= 18|issue=2 |pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive psychological stress can lead to motivation and challenge instead of anxiety. The effects of experiencing [[eustress]], which is positive stress, versus [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], which is negative stress, are significant. While colloquially lumped together, the various types of stress should be treated as separate concepts.

==Variations==
Selye proposed that there are four variations of stress.&lt;ref name= Selye&gt;{{cite book|last=Selye|first=Hans|title=Stress without distress|year=1974|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On one axis, there is good stress ([[eustress]]) and bad stress ([[Distress (medicine)|distress]]). On the other is over-stress (hyperstress) and understress (hypostress).  The goal is to balance these as much as possible. The ultimate goal would be to balance hyperstress and hypostress perfectly and have as much eustress as possible.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last= Selye|first=Hans |date=1983 |title=Stress Research Issues for the Eighties |chapter=The Stress Concept: Past, Present and Future|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first=C. L. |location= New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely useful for a productive lifestyle because it makes working enjoyable instead of a chore, as seen with distress.

==Differentiation between eustress and distress==
[[Eustress]] comes from the Greek root “eu” which means good as in euphoria.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selye |first=Hans |date= 1975|title= Implications of Stress Concept|journal=New York State Journal of Medicine|volume=75 |pages=2139–2145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eustress is when a person perceives a stressor as positive.&lt;ref name=Fevre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fevre|first=Mark Le|author2=Kolt, Gregory S. |author3=Matheny, Jonathan |title=Eustress, distress and their interpretation in primary and secondary occupational stress management interventions: which way first?|journal=Journal of Managerial Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=547–565|doi=10.1108/02683940610684391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distress stems from the Latin root “dis” as in dissonance or disagreement.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"/&gt; Distress is a threat to the quality of life. It is when a demand vastly exceeds a person’s capabilities.&lt;ref name= Fevre /&gt;

There is likely a connection between stress and illness.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simandan2010/&gt; Theories of the stress–illness link suggest that both [[Acute stress reaction|acute]] and chronic stress can cause illness, and several studies found such a link.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman, N. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneiderman | first1 = N. | last2 = Ironson | first2 = G. | last3 = Siegel | first3 = S.

Chronic stress and a lack of coping resources available or used by an individual can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] (see below for further information).&lt;ref&gt;Schlotz W, Yim IS, Zoccola PM, Jansen L, Schulz P (2011). The perceived stress reactivity scale: Measurement invariance, stability, and validity in three countries. Psychol Assess. (pp. 80–94).&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true regarding chronic stressors. These are stressors that may not be as intense as an acute stressor like a natural disaster or a major accident, but they persist over longer periods of time. These types of stressors tend to have a more negative impact on health because they are sustained and thus require the body's physiological response to occur daily. This depletes the body's energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time, especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided (i.e. stress of living in a dangerous neighborhood). See [[allostatic load]] for further discussion of the biological process by which chronic stress may affect the body. For example, studies have found that caregivers, particularly those of dementia patients, have higher levels of depression and slightly worse physical health than noncaregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.250 |pmid=12825775 |title=Differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in psychological health and physical health: A meta-analysis |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=250–67 |year=2003 |last1=Pinquart |first1=Martin |last2=Sörensen |first2=Silvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that perceived chronic stress and the hostility associated with [[Type A personality|Type A personalities]] are often associated with much higher risks of cardiovascular disease. This occurs because of the compromised immune system as well as the high levels of arousal in the sympathetic nervous system that occur as part of the body's physiological response to stressful events.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret E. Kemeny, "The Psychobiology of Stress" in Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 12, No. 4 (Aug., 2003), pp. 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for individuals to exhibit [[hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]{{snd}} a term referring to the ability to be both chronically stressed and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, S.

It has long been believed that negative affective states, such as feelings of anxiety and depression, could influence the pathogenesis of physical disease, which in turn, have direct effects on biological process that could result in increased risk of disease in the end. However, studies done by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other places have shown this to be partly untrue; although stress seems to increase the risk of reported poor health, the ''perception'' that stress is harmful increases the risk even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026743 |pmid=22201278 |pmc=3374921 |title=Does the perception that stress affects health matter?

Chronic stress results from stressful events that persist over a relatively long period of time, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, or results from brief focal events that continue to be experienced as overwhelming even long after they are over, such as experiencing a sexual assault.

Experiments show that when healthy human individuals are exposed to acute laboratory stressors, they show an adaptive enhancement of some markers of natural immunity but a general suppression of functions of specific immunity. By comparison, when healthy human individuals are exposed to real-life chronic stress, this stress is associated with a biphasic immune response where partial suppression of cellular and humoral function coincides with low-grade, nonspecific inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natap.org/2007/HIV/101107_02.htm|title=Psychological Stress and Disease (HIV/AIDS)|website=www.natap.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though psychological stress is often connected with illness or disease, most healthy individuals can still remain disease-free after confronting chronic stressful events. Also, people who do not believe that stress will affect their health do not have an increased risk of illness, disease, or death.&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"/&gt; This suggests that there are individual differences in vulnerability to the potential pathogenic effects of stress; individual differences in vulnerability arise due to both genetic and psychological factors. In addition, the age at which the stress is experienced can dictate its effect on health. Research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong impacts on the biological, psychological, and behavioral responses to stress later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163551 |pmid=19035829 |title=Health Psychology: Developing Biologically Plausible Models Linking the Social World and Physical Health |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=60 |pages=501–24 |year=2009 |last1=Miller |first1=Gregory |last2=Chen |first2=Edith |last3=Cole |first3=Steve W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stress has a physical effect on the body, some individuals may not distinguish this from other more serious illnesses.
If the symptom is unambiguous (e.g. a breast lump), individuals are motivated to seek care regardless if they are under stress.
However, if the symptom is ambiguous (e.g. [[headache]]), they will not seek care attributing the symptom to stress if the stressor's onset is recent which began in the previous 3 weeks, and will seek care if the onset is not recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7732157 |year=1995 |author1=Cameron |first1=L |title=Seeking medical care in response to symptoms and life stress |journal=Psychosomatic medicine |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |last2=Leventhal |first2=E. A |last3=Leventhal |first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
In animals, stress contributes to the initiation, growth, and metastasis of select tumors, but studies that try to link stress and cancer incidence in humans have had mixed results. This can be due to practical difficulties in designing and implementing adequate studies.&lt;ref name = Cohen2007/&gt; Personal belief in stress as a risk factor for cancer was common in one [[UK]] study, though awareness of risk factors overall was found to be low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shahab |first1=Lion |last2=McGowan |first2=Jennifer A. |last3=Waller |first3=Jo |last4=Smith |first4=Samuel G. |title=Prevalence of beliefs about actual and mythical causes of cancer and their association with socio-demographic and health-related characteristics: Findings from a cross-sectional survey in England |journal=European Journal of Cancer |date=April 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2018.03.029 |url=https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(18)30778-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutral stressors==
Stress is a non-specific response.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; It is neutral, and what varies is the degree of response. It is all about the context of the individual and how they perceive the situation. Selye defined stress as “the nonspecific (that is, common) result of any demand upon the body, be the effect mental or somatic.”&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; This includes the medical definition of stress as a physical demand and the colloquial definition of stress as a psychological demand. A stressor is inherently neutral meaning that the same stressor can cause either distress or eustress. It is individual differences and responses that induce either distress or eustress.&lt;ref name = "HNC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hargrove |first=M. B. |last2= Nelson|first2=D.

==Types of stressors==
A [[stressor]] is any event, experience, or environmental stimulus that causes stress in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stressor |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/stressor |publisher=Collins English Dictionary{{snd}} Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition.

Researchers have found that stressors can make individuals more prone to both physical and psychological problems, including [[heart disease]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="pastorino"&gt;Pastorino, E. &amp; Doyle-Portillo, S. (2009). What is Psychology?. 2nd Ed. Belmont, CA: Thompson Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors are more likely to affect an individual's health when they are "chronic, highly disruptive, or perceived as uncontrollable".&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; In [[psychology]], researchers generally classify the different types of stressors into four categories: 1) crises/catastrophes, 2) major life events, 3) daily hassles/microstressors, and 4) ambient stressors.

===Crises/catastrophes===
This type of stressor is unforeseen and unpredictable and, as such, is completely out of the control of the individual.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples of [[crises]] and catastrophes include: devastating [[natural disaster]]s, such as major [[flood]]s or [[earthquake]]s, [[war]]s, etc. Though rare in occurrence, this type of stressor typically causes a great deal of stress in a person's life.  A study conducted by Stanford University found that after natural disasters, those affected experienced a significant increase in stress level.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Combat stress is a widespread acute and chronic problem. With the rapid pace and the urgency of firing first, tragic episodes of accidentally killing friendly forces (“brother” killing “brother” or fratricide) may happen. Prevention requires stress reduction, emphasis on vehicle and other identification training, awareness of the tactical situation, and continual risk analysis by leaders at all echelons.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22–51, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major life events===
Common examples of major life events include: [[marriage]], going to [[college]], [[death]] of a loved one, [[birth]] of a child, moving houses, etc. These events, either positive or negative, can create a sense of uncertainty and fear, which will ultimately lead to stress. For instance, research has found the elevation of stress during the transition from high school to university, with college freshmen being about two times more likely to be stressed than final year students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teo |first1=Loo Yee |first2=Jia Yuin |last2=Fam |title=Prevalence and determinants of perceived stress among undergraduate students in a Malaysian University |journal=Journal of Health and Translational Medicine |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=2018 |pages=1–5 |url=https://mjes.um.edu.my/index.php/jummec/article/view/11016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found major life events are somewhat rare to be major causes of stress, due to its rare occurrences.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;

The length of time since occurrence and whether or not it is a positive or negative event are factors in whether or not it causes stress and how much stress it causes. Researchers have found that events that have occurred within the past month generally are not linked to stress or illness, while chronic events that occurred more than several months ago are linked to stress and illness&lt;ref name=pmid9619470&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.3.214 |pmid=9619470 |title=Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in healthy adults |journal=Health Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=214–23 |year=1998 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Frank |first2=Ellen |last3=Doyle |first3=William J |last4=Skoner |first4=David P |last5=Rabin |first5=Bruce S |last6=Gwaltney |first6=Jack M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personality change.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt; Additionally, positive life events are typically not linked to stress{{snd}} and if so, generally only trivial stress{{snd}} while negative life events can be linked to stress and the health problems that accompany it.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; However, positive experiences and positive life changes can predict decreases in neuroticism.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"/&gt;

===Daily hassles/microstressors===
This category includes daily [[annoyance]]s and minor hassles.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples include: making decisions, meeting deadlines at work or school, traffic jams, encounters with irritating personalities, etc. Often, this type of stressor includes [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]s with other people. Daily stressors, however, are different for each individual, as not everyone perceives a certain event as stressful. For example, most people find public speaking to be stressful, nevertheless, a seasoned politician most likely will not.

Daily hassles are the most frequently occurring type of stressor in most adults. The high frequency of hassles causes this stressor to have the most physiological effect on an individual. Carolyn Aldwin, Ph.D., conducted a study at the Oregon State University that examined the perceived intensity of daily hassles on an individual's mortality. Aldwin's study concluded that there is a strong correlation between individuals who rate their hassles as very intense and a high level of mortality. One's perception of his/her daily stressors can have a modulating effect on the physiological impact of daily stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2014.06.019 |pmid=24995936 |pmc=4253863 |title=Do hassles mediate between life events and mortality in older men? |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=59 |pages=74–80 |year=2014 |last1=Aldwin |first1=Carolyn M |last2=Jeong |first2=Yu-Jin |last3=Igarashi |first3=Heidi |last4=Choun |first4=Soyoung |last5=Spiro |first5=Avron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major psychological types of conflicts that can cause stress.

* The approach-approach conflict, occurs when a person is choosing between two equally attractive options, i.e. whether to go see a movie or to go see a concert.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The avoidance-avoidance conflict, occurs where a person has to choose between two equally unattractive options, for example, to take out a second loan with unappealing terms to pay off the mortgage or to face foreclosure on one's house.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The approach-avoidance conflict,&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; occurs when a person is forced to choose whether or not to partake in something that has both attractive and unattractive traits{{snd}} such as whether or not to attend an expensive college (meaning taking out loans now, but also meaning a quality education and employment after graduation).

Travel-related stress results from three main categories: lost time, surprises (an unforeseen event such as lost or delayed baggage) and routine breakers (inability to maintain daily habits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWT rolls out solution to tackle cost of travel stress|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=29 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182351/http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient stressors===
As their name implies, these are global (as opposed to individual) low-grade stressors that are a part of the background environment.  They are defined as stressors that are "chronic, negatively valued, non-urgent, physically perceptible, and intractable to the efforts of individuals to change them".&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0013916583153005 |title=Ambient Stressors |journal=Environment and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=355–80 |year=2016 |last1=Campbell |first1=Joan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of ambient stressors are pollution, noise, crowding, and traffic.  Unlike the other three types of stressor, ambient stressors can (but do not necessarily have to) negatively impact stress without conscious awareness.  They are thus low on what Stokols called "perceptual salience".{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Mentioned neither the author nor the concept before. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}&lt;ref name = campbell/&gt;

===Organizational stressors===
Studies conducted in military and combat fields show that some of the most potent stressors can be due to personal organizational problems in the unit or on the home front.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). Combat and Operational Stress Control, FM 4-02.51, Washington, DC, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Stress due to bad organizational practices is often connected to "Toxic Leadership", both in companies and in governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn.

{{redirects|Stress Reliever|the track|R.E.D. (Ne-Yo album)}}
[[Stress management]] refers to a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's levels of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. It involves controlling and reducing the tension that occurs in stressful situations by making emotional and physical changes.

===Prevention and resilience building===
Decreasing stressful behaviors is a part of prevention, some of the common strategies and techniques are: Self-monitoring, tailoring, material reinforcement, social reinforcement, social support, self-contracting, contracting with significant other, shaping, reminders, self-help groups, professional help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greenberg|title=Comprehensive Stress Management 10E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-067104-1|pages=261–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174937/https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|archivedate=2017-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain |date=September 2018| reason = Some of these terms are probably unclear to the non-experts.}}

Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1-4441-6871-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biofeedback]] may also play a role in stress management. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.&lt;ref name="Sutarto2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10803548.2012.11076959 |pmid=23294659 |title=Resonant Breathing Biofeedback Training for Stress Reduction Among Manufacturing Operators |journal=International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=549–61 |year=2015 |last1=Purwandini Sutarto |first1=Auditya |last2=Abdul Wahab |first2=Muhammad Nubli |last3=Mat Zin |first3=Nora }}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping mechanisms===
{{Main|Coping (psychology)}}
The Lazarus and Folkman model suggests that external events create a form of pressure to achieve, engage in, or experience a stressful situation. Stress is not the external event itself, but rather an interpretation and response to the potential threat; this is when the coping process begins.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=C.R.|last2=Lefcourt|first2=Herbert M.|title=Coping With Stress|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York|pages=68–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various ways individuals deal with perceived threats that may be stressful. However, people have a tendency to respond to threats with a predominant coping style, in which they dismiss feelings, or manipulate the stressful situation.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt;

There are different classifications for coping, or [[defense mechanisms]], however they all are variations on the same general idea: There are good/productive and negative/counterproductive ways to handle stress. Because stress is perceived, the following mechanisms do not necessarily deal with the actual situation that is causing an individual stress. However, they may be considered coping mechanisms if they allow the individual to cope better with the negative feelings/anxiety that they are experiencing due to the perceived stressful situation, as opposed to actually fixing the concrete obstacle causing the stress. The following mechanisms are adapted from the DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.

====Highly adaptive/active/problem-focused mechanisms====
These skills are what one could call as “facing the problem head on”, or at least dealing with the negative emotions experienced by stress in a constructive manner. (generally adaptive)

* '''Affiliation''' ("[[tend and befriend]]") – involves dealing with stress by turning to a social network for support, but an individual does not share with others in order to diffuse or avoid the responsibility.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"&gt;Levo, Lynn M. (2003, September.) Understanding Defense Mechanisms. ''Lukenotes''. 7(4). St. Luke Institute, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"&gt;Adapted from DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Humor]]''' – the individual steps outside of a situation in order to gain greater perspective, and also to highlight any comic aspect to be found in their stressful circumstances.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"/&gt;
[[File:Two people laughing.jpg|thumb|Coping through laughter]]
::“The Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor defines therapeutic humor as ‘any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression or appreciation of the absurdity of or incongruity of life’s situations. This intervention may enhance health or be used as a complementary treatment of illness to facilitate healing or coping whether physical, emotional, cognitive, or spiritual”.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia|title=Communication in Nursing|date=2012|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Missouri|pages=160–173|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[Sigmund Freud]], a well known neurologist, suggests the humor was an excellent defensive strategy in emotional situations.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt; When one laughs during a tough situation they feel absent from their worries, and this allows them to think differently.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; When one experiences a different mind set, they feel more in control of their response, and how they will go about dealing with the event that caused stress.

::Lefcourt (2001) suggests that this perspective-taking humor is the most effective due to its ability to distance oneself from the situation of great stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefcourt|first1=H. M.|editor1-last=Snyder|editor1-first=C. R.|title=Coping with Stress: Effective People and Processes.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198029950|pages=68–92|chapter=The Humor Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that the use of laughter and humor creates a sense of relief of stress that can last up to 45 minutes post-laughter&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt;.

::Also, most hospitalized children have been seen to use laughter and play to relieve their fear, pain and stress. It has been discovered that there is a great importance in the use of laughter and humor in stress coping.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; Humans should use humor as a means to transcend their original understanding of an external event, take a different perspective, in which their anxiety may be minimized by.

* '''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''' – allows an "indirect resolution of conflict with neither adverse consequences nor consequences marked by loss of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valliant | first1 = George E. | year = 2000 | title = Adaptive Mental Mechanisms | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 89–98 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.89| pmid = 11392869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this mechanism allows channeling of troubling emotions or impulses into an outlet that is socially acceptable.
* '''Positive reappraisal''' – redirects thoughts (cognitive energy) to good things that are either occurring or have not occurred. This can lead to [[personal growth]], [[self-reflection]], and awareness of the power/benefits of one's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Folkman | first1 = S. | last2 = Moskowitz | first2 = J. | year = 2000 | title = Stress, Positive Emotion, and Coping | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 115–118 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00073}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies on [[veteran]]s of war or peacekeeping operations indicate that persons who construe a positive meaning from their combat or threat experiences tend to adjust better than those who do not.&lt;ref name="pmid17532104"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schok ML, Kleber RJ, Elands M, Weerts JM |title=Meaning as a mission: a review of empirical studies on appraisals of war and peacekeeping experiences |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |year=2008 |pmid=17532104 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.04.005 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final path model fitted well (CF1 = 1, RMSEA = 0.00) and showed that direct quality of life paths with β = -0.2, and indirect social support with β = -0.088 had the most effects on reduction of stress during pregnancy.{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Comes out of nowhere.  Phrases require further explanations. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}
Other adaptive coping mechanisms include [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]], [[altruism]], and [[self-observation]].

====Mental inhibition/disavowal mechanisms====
These mechanisms cause the individual to have a diminished (or in some cases non-existent) awareness about their anxiety, threatening ideas, fears, etc., that come from being conscious of the perceived threat.

* '''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''' – This is when an individual redirects their emotional feelings about one situation to another, less threatening one.&lt;ref&gt;"displacement n." A Dictionary of Psychology. Edited by Andrew M. Colman. Oxford University Press 2009. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''' – Repression occurs when an individual attempts to remove all their thoughts, feelings, and anything related to the upsetting/stressful (perceived) threat out of their awareness in order to be disconnected from the entire situation. When done long enough in a successful way, this is more than just denial.
* '''[[Reaction formation]]''' – An individual substitutes their feelings or thoughts or behavior with the exact opposite. An attempt to remove any “unacceptable thoughts” from one's consciousness by replacing them with the exact opposite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/engl/theory/psychoanalysis/definitions/reactionformation.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other inhibition coping mechanisms include undoing, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]. Although some people claim that inhibition coping mechanisms may eventually increase the stress level because the problem is not solved, detaching from the stressor can sometimes help people to temporarily release the stress and become more prepared to deal with problems later on.

====Active mechanisms====
These methods deal with stress by an individual literally taking action, or withdrawing.

* '''[[Acting out]]''' – Often viewed as counter-normative, or problematic behavior. Instead of reflecting or problem-solving, an individual takes maladaptive action.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"/&gt;
* '''[[Passive aggression]]''' – When an individual indirectly deals with his or her anxiety and negative thoughts/feelings stemming from their stress by acting in a hostile or resentful manner towards others. Help-Rejecting Complaining can also be included in this category.

====Health promotion====
There is an alternative method to coping with stress, in which one works to minimize their anxiety and stress in a preventative manner. If one works towards coping with stress daily, the feeling of stress and the ways in which one deals with it as the external event arises becomes less of a burden.

Suggested strategies to improve stress management include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia|title=Canadian Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|location=Toronto|pages=472–488|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Regular exercise – set up a fitness program, 3–4 times a week
# Support systems – to listen, offer advice, and support each other
# Time management – develop an organizational system
# Guided imagery and visualization – create a relaxing state of mind
# Progressive muscle relaxation – loosen tense muscle groups
# [[Assertiveness]] training – work on effective communication
# Journal writing – express true emotion, self-reflection
# Stress management in the workplace – organize a new system, switch tasks to reduce own stress.

Depending on the situation, all of these coping mechanisms may be adaptive, or maladaptive.

==Physiological response==

===To stress that affect communication===
The body responds to stress in many ways. Readjusting chemical levels is just one of them. Here are some examples of adjustments and changes that affect communication.

====General adaptive syndrome====
In terms of measuring the body's response to stress, psychologists tend to use Hans Selye's [[General adaptation syndrome#General adaptation syndrome|general adaptation syndrome]]. This model is also often referred to as the classic stress response, and it revolves around the concept of [[homeostasis]]. General adaptive syndrome occurs in three stages:

#'''The alarm reaction'''. This stage occurs when the stressor is first presented. The body begins to gather resources to deal with the stressor. The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]] are activated, resulting in the release of hormones from the [[adrenal gland]] such as [[cortisol]], adrenaline ([[epinephrine]]), and [[norepinephrine]] into the bloodstream to adjust bodily processes. These hormonal adjustments increase energy levels, increase muscle tension, reduce sensitivity to pain, slow down the digestive system, and cause a rise in blood pressure.&lt;ref name="GottliebBenjaminCoping"&gt;Gottlieb, Benjamin."Coping with Chronic Stress". Plenum Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Locus coeruleus]], a collection of Norepinephrine-containing neurons in the [[pons]] of the [[brainstem]] whose axons project to various regions of the brain, is involved in releasing Norepinephrine directly onto neurons. High levels of Norepinephrine acting as a neurotransmitter on its receptors expressed on neurons in brain regions, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]] is thought to be involved in the effects of stress on [[executive functions]], such as impaired [[working memory]].   
#'''The stage of resistance'''. The body continues building up resistance throughout the stage of resistance, until either the body's resources are depleted, leading to the exhaustion phase, or the stressful stimulus is removed. As the body uses up more and more of its resources people become increasingly tired and susceptible to illness. This stage is where psychosomatic disorders first begin to appear.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;
#'''The stage of exhaustion'''. The body is completely drained of the hormones and resources it was depending on to manage the stressor. The person now begins to exhibit behaviors such as anxiety, irritability, avoidance of responsibilities and relationships, self-destructive behavior, and poor judgment. If someone is experiencing these symptoms they have a much greater chance of lashing out, damaging relationships, or avoiding social interaction at all.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;

This [[Stress (biology)#Neurochemistry and physiology|physiological stress]] response involves high levels of [[sympathetic nervous system]] activation, often referred to as the "fight or flight" response. The [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm response] involves pupil dilation, release of endorphins, increased heart and respiration rates, cessation of digestive processes, secretion of adrenaline, arteriole dilation, and constriction of veins. This high level of arousal is often unnecessary to adequately cope with micro-stressors and daily hassles; yet, this is the response pattern seen in humans, which often leads to health issues commonly associated with high levels of stress.&lt;ref name="oregonstate.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|title=HHS 231 – Extended Campus – Oregon State University|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010135321/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quality of sleep====
Sleep allows people to rest and re-energize for another day filled with interactions and tasks. If someone is stressed it is extremely important for them to get enough sleep so that they can think clearly. Unfortunately, chemical changes in the body caused by stress can make sleep a difficult thing. [[Glucocorticoid]]s are released by the body in response to stress which can disrupt sleep. Sleep comes in four stages and the deepest, most restful sleep can only be attained after having been asleep for an hour.&lt;ref name=Sleep&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craven|first1=Ruth|last2=Hirnle|first2=Constance|last3=Jensen|first3=Sharon|title=Fundamentals of Nursing: Human and Health Function|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|page=1319|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stressful social experiences that affect communication===
When someone is stressed, many challenges can arise; a recognized challenge being communication difficulties. Here are some examples of how stress can hinder communication.

====Cultural differences: individualistic vs. collectivistic====
The cultures of the world generally fall into two categories; individualistic and collectivistic.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

* An [[individualistic]] culture, like that of the United States, where everyone is an independent entity defined by their accomplishments and goals.
* A collectivistic culture, like that of many Asian countries, prefers to see individuals as interdependent on each other. They value modesty and family.

These cultural differences can affect how people communicate when they are stressed. For example, a member of an individualistic cultural would be hesitant to ask for pain medication for fear of being perceived as weak. A member of a collectivistic culture would not hesitate. They have been brought up in a cultural where everyone helps each other and is one functional unit whereas the member of the individualistic culture is not as comfortable asking others for aid.&lt;ref name=Sleep/&gt;

====Language barriers====
{{Confusing section |date=September 2018| reason = Do the language barriers cause stress, or does stress add to language barriers?  What is cause, what is effect?  }}
Language barriers can also diminish communication due to stress.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison-Valfre|first1=Michelle|title=Foundations of mental health care|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-05644-1|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All languages have their own way of using names, titles, and just interacting. These differences can make inter lingual communication relatively stressful. Not speaking the same languages, different ways of showing respect, and different use of body language can make things difficult. Being uncomfortable with the communication around a person can discourage them from communicating at all.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"/&gt;

====Changes in the home====
Divorce, death, and remarriage are all disruptive events in a household.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt; Although everyone involved is affected by events such as these, it can be most drastically seen in children. Due to their age, children have relatively undeveloped coping skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002059.htm|title=Stress in childhood: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason a stressful event may cause some changes in their behavior. Falling in with a new crowd, developing some new and sometimes undesirable habits are just some of the changes stress may trigger in their lives.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

A particularly interesting response to stress is talking to an [[imaginary friend]]. A child may feel angry with a parent or their peers who they feel brought this change on them. They need someone to talk to but it definitely won’t be the person with whom they are angry. That’s when the imaginary friend comes in. They “talk” to this imaginary friend but in doing so they cut off communication with the real people around them.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

==Social support and health==
Researchers have long been interested in how an individual's level and types of [[social support]] impact the effect of stress on their health. Studies consistently show that social support can protect against physical and mental consequences of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uchino | first1 = B. N. | year = 2009 | title = Understanding the links between social support and physical health: A life-span perspective with emphasis on the separability of perceived and received support | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 236–255 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01122.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkman | first1 = L.

One model, known as the "direct effects" model, holds that social support has a direct, positive impact on health by increasing positive affect, promoting adaptive health behaviors, predictability and stability in life, and safeguarding against social, legal, and economic concerns that could negatively impact health. another model, the "buffering effect", says that social support exerts greatest influence on health in times of stress, either by helping individuals appraise situations in less threatening manners or coping with the actual stress. Researchers have found evidence to support both these pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S. | last2 = Wills | first2 = T. A. | year = 1985 | title = Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 310–357 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 | pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support is defined more specifically as psychological and material resources provided by a social network that are aimed at helping an individual cope with stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Social relationships and health | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 676–684 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.676 | pmid=15554821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers generally distinguish among several types of social support: instrumental support – which refers to material aid (e.g., financial support or assistance in transportation to a physician's appointment), informational support (e.g., knowledge, education or advice in problem-solving), and emotional support (e.g., empathy,  reassurance, etc.).&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"/&gt; Social support can reduce the rate of stress during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sara Shishehgar |author2=Abolfazl Mahmoodi |author3=Mahrokh Dolatian |author4=Zohreh Mahmoodi |author5=Maryam Bakhtiary |author6=Hamid Alavi Majd  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Relationship of Social Support and Quality of Life with the Level of Stress in Pregnant Women Using the PATH Model |journal=Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=560–5 |year=2013 |pmc=3871742 |doi=10.5812/ircmj.12174 |pmid=24396574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating with someone who is stressed==
{{How-to|date=August 2017}}

Social support from friends and the community can be very beneficial to helping someone communicate while stressed. Social support is giving a person the knowledge that they are part of a mutual network of caring, interested others, that enable them to lower levels of stress and be better able to cope with the stress that they undergo.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldman &amp; Dinardo|first1=Robert S., Andrea|title=Essentials of understanding psychology|date=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|location=Toronto|isbn=9780070974111|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social and emotional support people provide for each other demonstrates that they are important and valued members of social networks.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"/&gt;

The stress of a person can greatly affect those around them, especially in families. “Families can experience many conflicting emotions when placed in the position of providing protected care for a loved one. Compassion, protectiveness, and caring can be intermingled with feelings of helplessness and being trapped."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold &amp; Boggs|first1=Elizabeth, Kathleen Underman|title=Interpersonal Relationships : Professional Communication Skills For Nurses|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9781437709445|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support is crucial to helping families cope with the challenge of supporting their loved one (stressed person).&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships" /&gt;  This emotional support can be expressed through many communication methods.

In order to be able to effectively communicate with someone who is stressed, it is important to know how to interact with them in a way that can be beneficial for them. Therapeutic communication techniques can help with different types of communication. These techniques include but are not limited to listening, making open-ended comments, reducing distance, restating, seeking clarification, reflecting, and planning.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia Balzer|title=Communication in nursing.|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Mosby|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323083348|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actively listening to someone when they are stressed can help them release frustrations and cope with their problems. Listening shows that you are interested in the person, and can have great therapeutic value. It is important to show that the stressed person's needs are above the caregiver's in order for the interaction to be therapeutic.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt; It is important that you remain prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically to assist him or her. It is favorable to remain punctual and polite in the manner of relating to them, and that the best methods are used to promote their well-being and comfort.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Verbal communication methods===
* Making open-ended comments can allow the person who is stressed to decide the direction that the interaction can take and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* In order to validate that the message is being interpreted properly, it is a good idea to restate what the person has said. Seeking clarification can also help to ensure the understanding of what they’re communicating.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* Try reflecting about what the stressed person has said to you. It will show that you see and understand the importance in his or her feelings, ideas and interpretations. It is important to avoid being judgmental, and rejecting what the person has said. It may make them feel that they are personally being rejected.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* At the end of the conversation, it is a good idea to help them plan their goals, direction and so forth, of future interactions.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Nonverbal communication methods===
* Having a posture that is slightly leaning towards the person communicates interest and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Reducing physical distance between yourself and the person who is stressed, indicates that you want to be involved in helping the person.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* "Try maintaining an open, friendly expression without being boisterously cheerful. Avoid furrowed forehead or a distracted or bored expression."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Making direct eye contact also generally conveys that you show interest and concern for them.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;
* It is very beneficial to generally focus on maintaining an open atmosphere when speaking to someone. However, it is also important to pay attention to their nonverbal cues as well. By using their nonverbal cues, you can interpret their mood and/or feelings. This will help with adapting to the situation and communicating better.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;

===How to prevent misunderstanding===
Communication is an important stress-management skill. Although this seems like an easy skill, there is much more to communication than simply speaking. In fact, communication can cause problems such as misunderstandings when not used effectively. When miscommunication happen there tends to be more problems, anger and resentment then if communication were effective in the first place. There are certain things that need to be done to achieve effective communication.&lt;ref name= Edelman&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman, C.L., Kudzma, E.C., Mandle|first=C.L.|title=Health Promotion Throughout the Life Span, Chapter 13|date=2014|volume=8th edition|pages=310–313|publisher=St. Louis, MO:Elsevier, Mosby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''first guideline'' is to be clear about is what is wanted or needed when speaking with others.

This technique requires the individual’s recognition of distorted and exaggerated expectations and thoughts.

An easy way to meet this guideline is by reflecting the purpose of the conversation in the statement. By reflecting what the desired outcome of the conversation is, there is little room for miscommunication.

The ''second guideline'' for effective communication is to use assertive communication.

An assertive statement is non-judgmental, expresses feelings and opinions and reaffirms perceived rights.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;
The best way to use the assertive technique is with manipulating the following formula:

* I feel [emotion], when you [the behavior], because [explanation].

When people are stressed, they cannot verbalize their feelings correctly. When the receiver in the conversation cannot understand the needs of the person, miscommunications happen and the person may feel victimized and blame others for not understanding. The third guideline is empathy which is defined as the ability to consider another person’s perspective and to communicate this perspective back to that person.

The ''final guideline'' to prevent misunderstandings when communicating while stressed is cognitive restructuring which facilitates assertive communication as it requires the person to identify their thoughts and feelings. Some ways to restructure cognitively is by stopping and understanding what the conversation holds.

Breathing deeply as this will release any tension and promote relaxation which will allow you to reflect on the true emotions.

Reflecting on how you feel emotionally and how you feel immediately allow you to choose the right answer.

Choosing the more realistic and helpful way of thinking allows the communication to be straight forward and upfront leaving little room for miscommunication.

By following the above techniques and guidelines, the chance of a miscommunication in a conversation will decrease. Once the ability to communicate with assertive techniques is worked into everyday life, the frequency of misunderstandings will decrease significantly.

The importance of understanding how to communicate assertively is critical for daily life. With the knowledge of how to properly communicate, whether stressed or not, the ability to communicate will become easier and result in less misunderstandings and frustrations which can contribute to one’s stress.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;

==Scales==
Life events scales can be used to assess stressful things that people experience in their lives. One such scale is the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], also known as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, or SRRS.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes | first1 = TH | last2 = Rahe | first2 = RH  | year = 1967 | title = The Social Readjustment Rating Scale | url = | journal = J Psychosom Res | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 213–8 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4 | pmid=6059863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe in 1967, the scale lists 43 stressful events.

To calculate one's score, add up the number of "life change units" if an event occurred in the past year. A score of more than 300 means that individual is at risk for illness, a score between 150 and 299 means risk of illness is moderate, and a score under 150 means that individual only has a slight risk of illness.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5817">[[File:Region-beta paradox.png|thumb|The region-beta paradox: a person prefers to walk (at 3 miles per hour) if distances are less than a mile, and to cycle (15 miles per hour) for longer distances. Despite the remoteness of points in region beta, they will be reached faster than most points in the nearby region alpha.]]
The '''region-beta paradox''' denotes the phenomenon that people can sometimes recover more quickly from more intense emotions or pain than from less distressing experiences. The hypothesized reason is that intense states trigger psychological defense processes that reduce the distress, while less intense states do not trigger the same psychological defense processes and, therefore, less effective attenuation of the stress occurs. However, people typically predict intense states to last longer.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"/&gt;

The paradox has been observed in the psychological effects of exposure to terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=Brandon2007/&gt; This is likely related to activation of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], [[cognitive dissonance]] and other forms of mental mobilization.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2003/&gt;

It has been computationally modelled in an [[affective computing]] model.&lt;ref name="Steephen2013"/&gt;

==Origin of name==
The name originates from the illustration in the paper by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Gilbert]] et al.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"/&gt; that introduced the paradox. They consider a commuter who has the habit of walking to destinations within a mile of her origin, and biking to more distant destinations. Since the bike is faster the commuter will reach some distant locations more quickly than a nearer destinations (region beta in their diagram), reversing the normal tendency to arrive later at more distant locations.

This [[Monotonic function|non-monotonicity]] applies to states where interventions can be chosen, but are not chosen below certain thresholds (because of cost etc.). For example, injured people may be more likely to seek out effective means to speed their recovery (taking medicine, going to a doctor, undergoing surgery) when the injury is more severe than for mild injuries, making the lesser injuries last longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14638">'''Sensory overload''' occurs when one or more of the body's [[senses]] experiences [[over-stimulation]] from the environment.  There are many environmental elements that affect an individual. Examples of these elements are [[urbanization]], crowding, [[noise]], [[mass media]], [[technology]], and the explosive growth of [[information]].&lt;ref name="North Shore Pediatric Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nspt4kids.com/health-topics-conditions/sensory-overload/ |title=What is Sensory Overload |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FX&gt;[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/EffectsofPsychologicalTorturepaper%28Final%2911June10.pdf Effects of Psychological Torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APA&gt;[http://progressivehistorians.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/my-apa-paper-on-isolation-sensory-deprivation-sensory-overload/ Isolation, Sensory Deprivation &amp; Sensory Overload]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
There are a wide variety of symptoms that have been found to be associated with sensory overload. These symptoms can occur in both children and adults. Some of these symptoms are:
*[[Irritability]]
*"Shutting down", or refusing to participate in activities and interact with others
*Avoiding touching or being touched
*Getting overexcited 
*Covering [[eyes]] around bright lights
*Making poor [[eye contact]]
*Covering [[ears]] to close out [[sound]]s or [[voice]]s
*Complaining about noises that do not affect others
*Having difficulty focusing on an activity
*Constantly changing activities without any completing tasks
*Irritation caused by shoes, socks, tags, or different textures
*Over-sensitivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds
*Having trouble with social interactions
*Extremely high or extremely low activity levels&lt;ref name="North Shore Pediatric Therapy"/&gt;
*Muscle tension
*Fidgeting and [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]]
*Angry outbursts
*[[Sleeplessness]] and [[fatigue]]
*Difficulty concentrating&lt;ref name="Sharon Heller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sharonheller.net/psychopathology.php |title=SPD &amp; Psychopathology in Adults |format= |work=Sharon Heller |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sensory overload can result from the overstimulation of any of the senses.
*'''Hearing''': loud noise, or sound from multiple sources, such as several people talking at once.
*'''Sight''': crowded or cluttered spaces, bright lights, strobing lights, or environments with lots of movement such as crowds or frequent scene changes on television.
*'''Smell and taste''': strong aromas or spicy foods.
*'''Touch''': tactile sensations such as being touched by another person or the feel of cloth on skin.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/sensory-overload-sources-and-strategies |title=Sensory Overload: Sources and Strategies|format= |work= CFIDS &amp; Fibromyalgia Self-Help |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Vestibular''': such as dizziness or [[motion sickness]].

==As component of other disorders and conditions==
Sensory overload has been found to be associated with other disorders and conditions such as:
*[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)
*[[Fibromyalgia]] (FM)
*[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]] (ME/CFS)
*[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)
*[[Autism spectrum disorders]]&lt;ref name="O'Neill 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Neill M |author2=Jones RS |title=Sensory-perceptual abnormalities in autism: a case for more research? |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=283–93 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9229259 |doi= 10.1023/A:1025850431170|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marco 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marco EJ |author2=Hinkley LB |author3=Hill SS |author4=Nagarajan SS |title=Sensory processing in autism: a review of neurophysiologic findings |journal=Pediatr.

==Treatments==
There are many different ways to treat sensory overload.  One way to reduce this tension is to participate in [[occupational therapy]]; however, there are many ways for people with symptoms to reduce it themselves.  Being able to identify one's own triggers of sensory overload can help reduce, eliminate, or avoid them.&lt;ref name="Help for Adult SPD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spdsupport.org/articles/21-help-adult-spd.shtml |title=Help for Adult SPD |work=SPD Support |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often the quickest way to ease sensory overload symptoms is to remove oneself from the situation.  Deep pressure against the skin combined with proprioceptive input that stimulates the receptors in the joints and ligaments often calms the nervous system. Reducing sensory input such as eliminating distressing sounds and lowering the lights can help. Calming, focusing music works for some. If a quick break does not relieve the problem, an extended rest is advised. People with [[sensory processing disorder|sensory processing issues]] may benefit from a sensory diet of activities and accommodations designed to prevent sensory overload and retrain the brain to process sensory input more typically. It is important in situations of sensory overload to calm oneself and return to a normal level.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"/&gt;

==Prevention==
There are two different methods to prevent sensory overload:  avoidance and setting limits.  The process of avoidance involves creating a more quiet and orderly environment.  This includes keeping the noise to a minimum and reducing the sense of clutter.  To prevent sensory overload, it is important to rest before big events and focus your attention and energy on one thing at a time.  Setting limits involves restricting the amount of time spent on various activities and selecting settings to carefully avoid crowds and noise.  One may also limit interactions with specific people to help prevent sensory overload.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"/&gt;

== Marketing ==
It can be difficult to distinguish and understand information when experiencing sensory overload. Even such meaningless stimuli such as white noise or flickering lights may induce sensory overload.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malhotra|first1=Naresh K.|title=Information and sensory overload. Information and sensory overload in psychology and marketing|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=September 5, 2006|volume=1|issue=3-4|pages=9–21|doi=10.1002/mar.4220010304|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.4220010304/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory overload is common among consumers as many corporations compete with each other especially when advertising.  Advertisers will use the best colours, words, sounds, textures, designs and much more to get the attention of a customer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The influence of selected senses on consumer experience: A brandy case|last = Pentz|first = Chris|date = May 14, 2013|journal = Acta Commercii|doi = 10.4102/ac.v13i1.183|pmid = |access-date = |first2 = Charlene|last2 = Gerber}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can influence the consumer, as they will be drawn to a product that is more attention grabbing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, policy makers and advertisers must be aware
that too much information or attention-grabbing products can cause sensory overload.

=== Implications of public policy ===

Implications of a public policy in regards to information overload have two main assumptions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The assumptions the policymakers have are, first, to assume that consumers have a great deal of processing capacity and a great deal of time to process information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Secondly, consumers can always absorb the information without serious concern about how much information has been presented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As researchers have pointed out, policymakers should better understand the difference between the process and availability of information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will help decrease the possibility of information overload.  In some cases, the time to process such information in a commercial can be 6 out of 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can lead consumers confused and overloaded with such fast paced information thrown at them. To understand how consumers process information three factors must be analyzed. Factors such as the amount of information given, the source of corrective information and the way in which it is all presented to the consumer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different types of media have different processing demands. An optimal outcome for policy makers to influence advertisers to try is to present information through a TV commercial stating simple facts about a product and then encourage the audience to check out their website for more details. Therefore, their quick processing time of a commercial was not overloaded with information thus saving the consumer from sensory overload.

=== Implications for the consumers ===

Consumers today are forced to learn to cope with overloading and an abundance of information,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; through the radio, billboards, television, newspapers and much more. Information is everywhere and being thrown at consumers from every angle and direction.  Therefore, Naresh K. Malhotra, the author of Information and Sensory Overload presents the following guidelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First, consumers must try to limit the intake of external information and sensory inputs to avoid sensory overload.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be done by tuning out irrelevant information presented by the media and marketers to get the attention of the consumer. Second, record important information externally rather than mentally. Information can be easily forgotten mentally once the individual becomes overloaded by their sense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus it is recommended for a consumer to write down important information rather than store it mentally. Third, when examining a product, do not overload their senses by examining more than five products at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will lead to confusion and frustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fourth, process information where there is less irrelevant information around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will eliminate external information and sensory distractions such as white noise and other information presented in an environment. Finally, it is important to make consuming a pleasant and relaxed experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will help diminish the stress, overwhelming feeling, and experience of sensory overload.

=== Human senses and marketing ===

Using the senses in marketing can be a useful sales tactic. Most commonly, marketers will take advantage of the humans four out of five senses to increase the amount of information being presented to the customer. 
* The sense of smell can affect a person's evaluation of products. Researchers have suggested that good or bad feelings can be generated by smells and usually associated with upbringing, emotion, learning and even culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the sense of smell is a tool to attract an individual’s attention to a certain product.
* The sense of hearing is a powerful sense. The ears are capable of picking up all sorts of information and can contribute to people's feelings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Marketers will play music to help create and control feelings within a consumer. This music can help great a positive and comfortable association with the brand.
* The sense of touch helps determine the quality of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus companies of certain products will make the sense of touch available to their consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "Touch here" or "feel me" signs encourage customers to interact with the product. Allowing a company's customers to touch a product will help add information from their senses.

Not many studies have been done on sensory overload, but one example of a sensory overload study was reported by Lipowski (1975)&lt;ref name="Lipowski1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipowski| first1=Z.J.| title=Sensory and information inputs overload: Behavioral effects|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=16|issue=3|year=1975| pages=199–221| issn=0010-440X| doi=10.1016/0010-440X(75)90047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his research review on the topic that discussed the work done by Japanese researchers at [[Tohoku University]]. The Tohoku researchers exposed their subjects to intense visual and auditory stimuli presented randomly in a condition of confinement ranging in duration from three to five hours. Subjects showed heightened and sustained arousal as well as mood changes such as aggression, anxiety, and sadness. These results have helped open the door to further research on sensory overload.

==History==
Sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] contributed to the description of sensory overload in his 1903 essay "[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]." Simmel describes an urban landscape of constant sensory stimuli against which the city-dweller must create a barrier in order to remain sane. For Simmel, the sensory overload of modern urban life depletes the body’s reservoirs of energy, leading, among other things, to a jaded or blasé [blasiert] mentality and an calculating, instrumentalizing approach to others.&lt;ref name="Modernism Lab Essays"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Metropolis_and_Mental_Life |title=The Metropolis and Mental Life |format= |work=Modernism Lab Essays |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel's approach can be compared to [[Freud]]'s writings on [[Shell shock]] as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s analysis of "shock" and urban life in his 1939 essay "On Some Motifs in [[Baudelaire]]."

The '''signal-to-interference ratio''' ('''SIR''' or '''''S/I'''''), also known as the '''carrier-to-interference ratio''' ('''CIR''' or '''''C/I'''''), is the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power ''S'' or ''C'' and the average received [[co-channel interference]] power ''I'', i.e. [[cross-talk]], from other transmitters than the useful signal. 

The CIR resembles the [[carrier-to-noise ratio]] (CNR or ''C/N''), which is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR or ''S/N'') of a modulated signal before demodulation. A distinction is that interfering radio transmitters contributing to ''I'' may be controlled by [[radio resource management]], while ''N'' involves noise power from other sources, typically [[additive white gaussian noise]] (AWGN).

==Carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio (CNIR)==
The CIR ratio is studied in interference limited systems, i.e. where ''I'' dominates over ''N'', typically in cellular radio systems and broadcasting systems where frequency channels are reused in view to achieve high level of area coverage. The ''C/N'' is studied in noise limited systems. If both situations can occur, the '''carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio''' ('''CNIR''' or '''''C/(N+I)''''') may be studied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">A theory of '''substantial forms''' asserts that forms (or ideas) organize matter and make it [[Intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligible]]. Substantial forms are the source of properties, order, unity, identity, and information about objects.

The idea of substantial forms dominates [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and [[medieval philosophy]], but has fallen out of favour in modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselmphilosophy.com/substance/ David Banach. What Killed Substantial Form?]&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of substantial forms has been abandoned for a [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]], or "bottom-up" theory of organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2c_51Hill.pdf Benjamin Hill.  Substantial Forms and the Rise of Modern Science]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such mechanistic treatments have been criticized for the same reasons [[atomism]] has received criticism, viz., for merely denying the existence of certain kinds of substantial forms in favor of others (here, that of atoms, which are then thought to be arranged into things possessing accidental forms) and not denying substantial forms as such, an impossible move.

==Articulation==

===Platonic forms===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] maintains in the ''[[Phaedo]]'' regarding our knowledge of equals:&lt;br&gt;
:''"Do they [equal things] seem to us to be equal in the same sense as what is Equal itself? Is there some deficiency in their being such as the Equal, or is there not?
::*''[Simias]-A considerable deficiency.
:''Whenever someone, on seeing something, realizes that that which he now sees wants to be like some other reality but falls short and cannot be like that other since it is inferior, do we agree that the one who thinks this must have prior knowledge of that to which he says it is like, but deficiently so?
::*''[Simmias] Necessarily. ...
:''We must then possess knowledge of the Equal before that time when we first saw the equal objects and realized that all these objects strive to be like the Equal but are deficient in this."

===Aristotelian forms===
{{main|Hylomorphism|Aristotle's biology}}
[[Aristotle]] was the first to distinguish between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] (''[[hyle]]'') and form (''morphe''). For Aristotle, [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] is the undifferentiated primal element: it is rather that from which things develop than a [[thing in itself]]. The development of particular things from this germinal matter consists in differentiation, the acquiring of particular forms of which the knowable universe consists (cf. [[Formal cause]]). The perfection of the form of a thing is its [[entelechy]] in virtue of which it attains its fullest realization of function ([[De anima]], ii. 2). Thus the entelechy of the [[human body|body]] is the [[soul]]. The origin of the differentiation process is to be sought in a [[Unmoved mover|prime mover]], i.e. pure form entirely separate from all matter, eternal, unchangeable, operating not by its own activity but by the impulse which its own absolute existence excites in matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Form}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early adoption===
Both Platonic and Aristotelian forms appear in [[medieval philosophy]].

Medieval theologians, newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christianity, such as to the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine to the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

The Aristotelian conception of form was adopted by the [[Scholastics]], to whom, however, its origin in the observation of the physical universe was an entirely foreign idea. The most remarkable adaptation is probably that of [[Aquinas]], who distinguished the spiritual world with its subsistent forms (formae separatae) from the material with its inherent forms which exist only in combination with matter.

==Criticism==
[[René Descartes|Descartes]], referring to substantial forms, says:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] They were introduced by philosophers solely to account for the proper action of natural things, of which they were supposed to be the principles and bases ... But no natural action at all can be explained by these substantial forms, since their defenders admit that they are occult, and that they do not understand them themselves. If they say that some action proceeds from a substantial form, it is as if they said it proceeds from something they do not understand; which explains nothing. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Descartes. "Letter to Regius," January 1642, in Oeuvres de Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

==Response to criticism==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] made efforts to return to forms. Substantial forms, in the strictest sense for Leibniz, are primitive active forces and are required for his metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert Merrihew. Leibniz: Determinist, Theist, Idealist, February 1999, pp. 308-341 (34)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/leib-met.htm#SH9c Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' (§10): &lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] the belief in substantial forms has a certain basis in fact, but that these forms effect no changes in the phenomena and must not be employed for the explanation of particular events. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020612043559/https://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#X|url=https://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#X|title=Discourse on Metaphysics|author=G W Leibniz|archivedate=12 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Story of My Experiments with Truth''''' is the autobiography of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]], covering his life from early childhood through to 1921. It was written in weekly instalments and published in his journal ''Navjivan'' from 1925 to 1929. Its English translation also appeared in installments in his other journal ''[[Young India]]''.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt; It was initiated at the insistence of [[Swami Anand]] and other close co-workers of Gandhi, who encouraged him to explain the background of his public campaigns. In 1999, the book was designated as one of the "100 Best Spiritual Books of the 20th Century" by a committee of global spiritual and religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/books/book372.htm |title=Spiritual books of the century | work=USA Today | date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

=== Translator's preface ===
This section is written by [[Mahadev Desai]] who translated the book from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] to English in 1940. In this preface Desai notes that the book was originally published in two volumes, the first in 1927 and second in 1929. He also mentions that the original was priced at {{INRConvert|1}} and had a run of five editions by the time of the writing of his preface. 50,000 copies had been sold in Gujarati but since the English edition was expensive it prevented Indians from purchasing it. Desai notes the need to bring out a cheaper English version. He also mentions that the translation has been revised by an English scholar who did not want his name to be published. Chapters XXIX-XLIII of Part V were translated by Desai's friend and colleague Pyarelal.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=M. K. Gandhi.

=== Introduction ===
The introduction is written by Gandhi himself mentioning how he has resumed writing his autobiography at the insistence of Jeramdas, a fellow prisoner in [[Yerwada Central Jail]] with him. He mulls over the question a friend asked him about writing an autobiography, deeming it a Western practice, something "nobody does in the east".&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=edited by Richard L.|title=Gandhi's experiments with truth : essential writings by and about Mahatma Gandhi|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1143-7|pages=388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRQcKsx-YgQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi himself agrees that his thoughts might change later in life  but the purpose of his story is just to narrate his experiments with truth in life.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; He also says that through this book he wishes to narrate his spiritual and moral experiments rather than political.

=== Part I ===
The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Men of Turmoil – Biographies by Leading Authorities of the Dominating Personalities of Our Day|year=2007|publisher=Hesperides Press|isbn=1-4067-3625-2|pages=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MT8pbR2r4rAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play ''[[Harishchandra]]'' and says,"I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Pitirim A.

Gandhi got married at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; In his words, "It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage." Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth. His disdain for physical training at school, particularly gymnastics has also been written about in this part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudolph|first=Susanne Hoeber|title=Gandhi : the traditional roots of charisma|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-73136-0|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3Ac_HEZkcMC&amp;dq=|edition=[Pbk. ed.].|author2=R, Lloyd I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II ===
After a long history of antagonism, the British and the Dutch shared power in South Africa, with Britain ruling the regions of Natal and Cape Colony, while the Dutch settlers known as the Boers taking charge in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, two independent republics. The white settler and the independent Boer states continued to engage in volatile interactions with the British, so a threat of violent eruptions always loomed large. In order to placate both the Boer and other white settlers, the British adopted a number of racist policies, and while the Indians, most of them working on sugar and coffee plantations, did not suffer as much as the black population, they clearly experienced a treatment as second-class citizens. The initial story of Gandhi’s travails in South Africa and of his systematic struggle against oppression is well known. Gandhi repeatedly experienced the sting of humiliation during his long African sojourn. The incident at Maritzburg, where Gandhi was thrown off the train has become justly famous. When Gandhi, as a matter of principle, refused to leave the first class compartment, he was thrown off the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_2/04_arvind_narrain.pdf"|title = ""MY EXPERIMENTS WITH LAW": GANDHI’S EXPLORATION OF LAW’S POTENTIAL|last = Narrain|first = Arvind|date = April 1, 2013|journal = NUJS Law Review|access-date = January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gandhi also had difficulty being admitted to hotels, and saw that his fellow-Indians, who were mostly manual laborers, experienced even more unjust treatment.

Very soon after his arrival, Gandhi's initial bafflement and indignation at racist policies turned into a growing sense of outrage and propelled him into assuming a position as a public figure at the assembly of Transvaal Indians, where he delivered his first speech urging Indians not to accept inequality but instead to unite, work hard, learn English and observe clean living habits. Although Gandhi's legal work soon start to keep him busy, he found time to read some of Tolstoy's work, which greatly influenced his understanding of peace and justice and eventually inspired him to write to Tolstoy, setting the beginning of a prolific correspondence. Both Tolstoy and Gandhi shared a philosophy of non-violence and Tolstoy's harsh critique of human society resonated with Gandhi's outrage at racism in South Africa.

Both Tolstoy and Gandhi considered themselves followers of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] from the New Testament, in which Jesus Christ expressed the idea of complete self-denial for the sake of his fellow men. Gandhi also continued to seek moral guidance in the Bhagavad-Gita, which inspired him to view his work not as self-denial at all, but as a higher form of self-fulfillment. Adopting a philosophy of selflessness even as a public man, Gandhi refused to accept any payment for his work on behalf of the Indian population, preferring to support himself with his law practice alone.

But Gandhi's personal quest to define his own philosophy with respect to religion did not rely solely on sacred texts. At the time, he also engaged in active correspondence with a highly educated and spiritual Jain from Bombay, his friend Raychandra, who was deeply religious, yet well versed in a number of topics, from Hinduism to Christianity. The more Gandhi communicated with Raychandra, the more deeply he began to appreciate Hinduism as a non violent faith and its related scriptures. Yet, such deep appreciation also gave birth to a desire to seek inner purity and illumination, without solely relying on external sources, or on the dogma within every faith. Thus, although Gandhi sought God within his own tradition, he espoused the idea that other faiths remained worthy of study and contained their own truths.

Not surprisingly, even after his work assignment concluded, Gandhi soon found a reason to remain in South Africa. This pivotal reason involved the "Indian Franchise Bill", with which the Natal legislature intended to deprive Indians of the right to vote. No opposition existed against this bill, except among some of Gandhi's friends who asked him to stay in South Africa and work with them against this new injustice against Indians, who white South Africans disparagingly called "coolies." He found that racist attitudes had become deeply entrenched, especially in the Dutch-ruled regions, where they lived in the worst urban slums and could not own property or manage agricultural land. Even in Natal, where Indians had more influence, they were not allowed to go out after 9 p.m. without a pass, while in Cape Colony, another British territory, they were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk. The new bill which prohibited Indians from voting in Natal only codified existing injustice in writing.

Although a last-minute petition drive failed to the Indian Franchise Bill from passing, Gandhi remained active and organized a much larger petition, which he sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, and distributed to the press in South Africa, Britain and India. The petition raised awareness of the plight of Indians and generating discussions in all three continents to the point where both the Times of London and the Times of India published editorials in support of the Indian right to the vote. Gandhi also formed a new political organization called the Natal Indian Congress (a clear reference to the Indian National Congress), which held regular meetings and soon, after some struggles with financing, started its own library and debating society. They also issued two major pamphlets, An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa, and The Indian Franchise–An Appeal, which offered a logical argument against racial discrimination. He was also thrown of the Train when he didn't agree to move from his first class seat which he paid for.

Though, at first, Gandhi intended to remain in South Africa for a month, or a year at most, he ended up working in South Africa for about twenty years. After his initial assignment was over, he succeeded in growing his own practice to about twenty Indian merchants who contracted manage their affairs. This work allowed him to both earn a living while also finding time to devote to his mission as a public figure. During his struggle against inequality and racial discrimination in South Africa, Gandhi became known among Indians all around the world as "Mahatma," or "Great Soul."

=== Part III ===

In South Africa with the Family, the Boer War, Bombay and South Africa Again.

In 1896, Gandhi made a brief return to India and returned with his wife and children. In India, he published another pamphlet, known as the Green Pamphlet, on the plight of Indians in South Africa. For the first time, Gandhi realized that Indians had come to admire his work greatly and experienced a taste of his own popularity among the people, when he visited Madras, an Indian province, where most manual laborers had originated. Although his fellow-Indians greeted him in large crowds with applause and adulation, he sailed back to South Africa with his family in December 1896.

Gandhi had become very well known in South Africa as well, to the point where a crowd of rioters awaited him at Port Natal, determined that he should not be allowed to enter. Many of them also mistakenly believed that all the dark-skinned passenger on the ship that took Gandhi to Natal were poor Indian immigrants he had decided to bring along with him, when, in reality, these passengers were mostly returning Indian residents of Natal. Fortunately, Gandhi was able to establish a friendly relationship with the British in South Africa so the Natal port's police superintendent and his wife escorted him to safety. After this incident, local white residents began to actually regard him with greater respect.

As Gandhi resumed his work at the Natal Indian Congress, his loyalty to the British guided him to assist them in the Boer War, which started three years later. Because Gandhi remained a passionate pacifist, he wanted to participate in the Boer War without actually engaging in violence so he organized and led an Indian Medical Corps which served the British in a number of battles, including the important battle of '''Spion Kop in January 1900.'''

At the time, Gandhi believed that the British Empire shared the values of liberty and equality that he himself embraced and that, by virtue of defending those principles, the British constitution deserved the loyalty of all British subjects, including Indians. He viewed racist policy in South Africa as a temporary characteristic aberration, rather than a permanent tendency. With respect to the British in India, at this point in his life, Gandhi considered their rule beneficial and benevolent.

The armed conflict between the British and Dutch raged on for over three years of often brutal fighting with the British conquering the Transvaal and Orange Free state territories. Gandhi expected that the British victory would establish justice in South Africa and present him with an opportunity to return to India. He wanted to attend the 1901 meeting of the Indian National Congress, whose mission was to provide a social and political forum for the Indian upper class. Founded in 1885 by the British, the Congress had no real political power and expressed pro-British positions. Gandhi wanted to attend its meeting nevertheless, as he was hoping to pass a resolution in support of the Indian population in South Africa. Before he left for Bombay, Gandhi promised the Natal Indian Congress that he would return to support their efforts, should they need his help.

As Gandhi attended the 1901 Indian National Congress, his hopes came true. G.K. Gokhale, one of the most prominent Indian politicians of the time, supported the resolution for the rights of Indians in South Africa and the resolution passed. Through Gokhale, in whose house Gandhi stayed for a month, Gandhi met many political connections that would serve him later in life.

However, his promise to always aid his friends in Natal soon prompted him to return to South Africa, when he received an urgent telegram informing him that the British and Boers had now formed a peaceful relationship and often acted together to the detriment of the Indian population, as Britain was planning to live local white individuals in power in South Africa, much like it had done in Canada and Australia.

Gandhi travelled back to South Africa immediately and met with Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and presented him with a paper on the injustice against the Indian population but Chamberlain indicated that the Indians would have to obey the new rulers of South Africa, now called the "Afrikaners," which included both Dutch and British local settlers.

Gandhi began to organize a fast response to this new South African political configuration. Instead of working in Natal, he now established a camp in the newly conquered Transvaal region and began helping Indians who had escaped from the war in that region, and now had to purchase overly expensive re-entry passes. He also represented poor Indians whose dwellings in a shantytown the authorities had dispossessed. Gandhi also started a new magazine, Indian Opinion, that advocated for political liberty and equal rights in South Africa. The magazine, which initially included several young women from Europe, expanded its staff around the country, increasing both Gandhi's popularity and the public support for his ideas.

At round same time, Gandhi read John Ruskin's book ''[[Unto This Last]]'', which maintained that the life of manual labor was superior to all other ways of living. As he adopted this belief, Gandhi chose to abandon Western dress and habits, and he moved his family and staff to a Transvaal farm called the Phoenix, where he even gave renounced the use of an oil-powered engine and printed ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' by hand-wheel, and performed agriculture labor using old, manual farming equipment. He began to conceive of his public work as a mission to restore old Indian virtue and civilization, rather than fall prey to modern Western influence, which included electricity and technology.

Between 1901 and 1906, he also changed another aspect of his personal life by achieving Brahmacharya, or the voluntary abstention from sexual relations. He made this choice as part of his philosophy of selflessness and self-restraint. Finally, he also formulated his own philosophy of political protest, called Satyagraha, which literally meant "truth-force" in Sanskrit. In practice, this practice meant protesting injustice steadfastly, but in a non-violent manner.

He put this theory into practice on September 8, 1906, when, at a large gathering of the Indian community in Transvaal, he asked the whole community to take a vow of disobedience to the law, as the Transvaal government had started an effort to register every Indian child over the age of eight, which would make them an official part of the South African population.

Setting a personal example, Gandhi became the first Indian to appear before a magistrate for his refusal to register, and he was sentenced to two months in prison. He actually asked for a heavier sentence, a request, consistent with his philosophy of self-denial. After his release, Gandhi continued his campaign and thousands of Indians burned their registration cards, crossing the Transvaal-Natal border without passes. Many went to jail, including Gandhi, who went to jail again in 1908.

Gandhi did not waiver when a South African General by the name of Jan Christiaan Smuts promised to eliminate the registration law, but broke his word. Gandhi went all the way to London in 1909 and gathered enough support among the British to convince Smuts to eliminate the law in 1913. Yet, the Transvaal Prime Minister continued to regard Indians as second-class citizens while the Cape Colony government passed another discriminatory law making all non-Christian marriages illegal, which meant that all Indian children would be considered born out of wedlock. In addition, the government in Natal continued to impose crippling poll tax for entering Natal only upon Indians.

In response to these strikingly unjust rules, Gandhi organized a large-scale satyagraha, which involved women crossing the Natal-Transvaal border illegally. When they were arrested, five thousand Indian coal miners also went on strike and Gandhi himself led them across the Natalese border, where they expected arrest.

Although Smuts and Gandhi did not agree on many points, they had respect for each other. In 1913, Smuts relented due to the sheer number of Indians involved in protest and negotiated a settlement which provided for the legality of Indian marriages and abolished the poll tax. Further, the import of indentured laborers from India was to be phased out by 1920. In July 1914, Gandhi sailed for Britain, now admired as "Mahatma," and known throughout the world for the success of satyagraha.

=== Part IV ===
Part IV. Mahatma in the Midst of World Turmoil

Gandhi was in England when World War I started and he immediately began organizing a medical corps similar to the force he had led in the Boer War, but he also faced health problems that caused him to return to India, where he met the applauding crowds with enthusiasm once again. Indians continued to refer to him as "Mahatma" or "Great Soul," an appellation reserved only for the holiest men of Hinduism. While Gandhi accepted the love and admiration of the crowds, he also insisted that all souls were equal and did not accept the implication of religious sacredness that his new name carried.

In order to retreat into a life of humility and restraint, as his personal principles mandated, he decided to withdraw from public life for a while spending his first year in India focusing on his personal quest for purity and healing. He also lived in a communal space with untouchables, a choice which many of his financial supporters resented, because they believed that the very presence of untouchables defiled higher-caste Indians. Gandhi even considered moving to a district in Ahmedabad inhabited entirely by the untouchables when a generous Muslim merchant donated enough money to keep up his current living space for another year. By that time, Gandhi's communal life with the untouchables had become more acceptable.

Although Gandhi had withdrawn from public life, he briefly met with the British Governor of Bombay (and future Viceroy of India), Lord Willington, whom Gandhi promised to consult before he launched any political campaigns. Gandhi also felt the impact of another event, the passing of G.K. Gokhale, who had become his supporter and political mentor. He stayed away from the political trend of Indian nationalism, which many of the members of the Indian National Congress embraced. Instead, he stayed busy resettling his family and the inhabitants of the [[Phoenix Settlement]] in South Africa, as well as the Tolstoy Settlement he had founded near Johannesburg. For this purpose, on May 25, 1915, he created a new settlement, which came to be known as the Satyagraha ashram ( derive from Sanskrit word "Satya" means "truth" ) near the town of Ahmedabad and close to his place of birth in the western Indian province of Gujarati. All the inhabitants of the ashram, which included one family of untouchables, swore to poverty and chastity.

After a while, Gandhi became influenced by the idea of Indian independence from the British, but he dreaded the possibility that a westernized Indian elite would replace the British government. He developed a strong conviction that Indian independence should take place as a large-scale sociopolitical reform, which would remove the old plagues of extreme poverty and caste restrictions. In fact, he believed that Indians could not become worthy of self-government unless they all shared a concern for the poor.

As Gandhi resumed his public life in India in 1916, he delivered a speech at the opening of the new Hindu University in the city of Benares, where he discussed his understanding of independence and reform. He also provided specific examples of the abhorrent living conditions of the lower classes that he had observed during his travels around India and focused specifically on sanitation.

Although the Indians of the higher-castes did not readily embrace the ideas in the speech, Gandhi had now returned to public life and he felt ready to convert these ideas to actions. Facing the possibility of arrest, just like he always did in South Africa, Gandhi first spoke for the rights of impoverished indigo-cultivators in the Champaran district. His efforts eventually led to the appointment of a government commission to investigate abuses by the indigo planters.

He also interefered whenever he saw violence. When a group of Ahmedabad mill workers went on strike and became violent, he resolved to fast until they returned to peace. Though some political commentators condemned Gandhi's behavior as a form of blackmail, the fast only lasted three days before the workers and their employers negotiated an agreement. Through this situation, Gandhi discovered the fast as one of his most effective weapons in late years and set a precedent for later action as part of satyagraha.

As the First World War continued, Gandhi also became involved in recruiting men for the British Army, an involvement which his followers had a difficult time accepting, after listening to his passionate speeches about resisting injustice in a non-violent manner. Not surprisingly, at this point, although Gandhi still remained loyal to Britain and enamored with the ideals of the British constitution, his desire to support and independent home rule became stronger. As time passed, Gandhi became exhausted from his long journey around the country and fell ill with dysentery. He refused conventional treatment and chose to practice his own healing methods, relying on diet and spending a long time bedridden, while in recovery in his ashram.

In the meantime, India’s unrest was overwhelming at the prospect of the British destroying the world's only Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire. While the British alleged that they fought to protect the rights of small states and independent peoples from tyranny, in India, an increasing number of people found this alleged commitment less than genuine.

After the end of the war, the British government decided to follow the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee, which advocated the retention of various wartime restrictions in India, including curfews and measures to suppress free speech. Gandhi was still sick when these events took place and, although he could not protest actively, he felt his loyalty to the British Empire weaken significantly.

Later, when the Rowlatt Act actually became law, Gandhi proposed that the entire country observe a day of prayer, fasting, and abstention from physical labor as a peaceful protest against the injustice of the oppressive law. Gandhi's plea generated an overwhelming response as millions of Indians did not go to work on April 6, 1919.

As the entire country stood still, the British arrested Gandhi, which provoked angry crowds to fill the streets of India's cities and, much to Gandhi's dislike, violence erupted everywhere. Gandhi could not tolerate violence so he called off his campaign and asked that everyone return to their homes. He acted in accordance with his firm belief that if satyagraha could not be carried out without violence, it should not take place at all.

Unfortunately, not all protesters shared Gandhi's conviction as ardently. In Amritsar, capital of the region known as the Punjab, where the alarmed British authorities had deported the local Hindu and Muslim members of the Congress, the street mobs became very violent and the British summoned Brigadier-General Reginald E.H. Dyer to restore order. Dyer prohibited all public meetings and instituted public whippings for Indians who approached British policemen. Despite these new regulations, a crowd of over ten thousand protesters gathered in the center of Armitsar, and Dyer responded with bringing his troops there and opening fire without warning. Tightly packed together, the protesters had nowhere to run from the fire, even when they threw themselves down on the ground the fire was then directed on the ground, ceasing only when the British troops no longer had ammunition. Hundreds died and many more were wounded.

This unfortunate occurrence became known as the Amritsar Massacre, it outraged the British public almost as much as Indian society. The authorities in London eventually condemned Dyer's conduct, forcing him to resign in disgrace. The effect the massacre had on Indian society became even more profound as more moderate politicians, like Gandhi, now began to wholeheartedly support the idea of Indian independence, creating an intense climate of mutual hostility. After the massacre, Gandhi eventually obtained permission to travel to Amritsar and conduct his own investigation. He produced a report months later and his work on the report motivated him to contact a number of Indian politicians, who advocated for the idea of independence from British rule.

After Amritsar, Gandhi attended the Muslim Conference being held in Delhi, where Indian Muslims discussed their fears that the British would suppress Caliphs of Turkey. Muslims considered the Caliphs as heirs of Mohammed and spiritual heads of Islam. While the British considered such suppression a necessary effort to restore order after World War I, the Muslim populations viewed it as slap in the face. Gandhi urged them not to accept the actions of the British. He proposed a boycott of British goods, and stated that if the British continued to insist on the elimination of the Caliphate, Indian Muslims should take even more drastic measures of non-cooperation, involving areas such as government employment and taxes.

During the months that followed, Gandhi continued to advocate for peace and caution, however, since Britain and Turkey were still negotiating their peace terms. Unlike more nationalistic politicians, he also supported the [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] for India, as they laid the foundation for constitutional self-government. Eventually, other politicians who thought the reforms did not go far enough had to agree with Gandhi simply because his popularity and influence had become so great that the Congress could accomplish little without him.

As the British remained determined to put an end to the Muslim Caliphate, they enforced the [[Rowlatt Act]] resolutely. Even Gandhi became less tolerant towards British practices and in April 1920, he urged all Indians, Muslim and Hindu, to begin a "non-cooperation" protest against the British rule by giving up their Western clothing and British jobs. As a personal example, on August 1, he returned the kasar-i-hind medal that he had received for providing medical service to the Boer War's wounded British army  in South Africa. He also became the first president of the Home Rule League, a largely symbolic position which confirmed his position as an advocate for Indian Independence.

In September 1920, Gandhi also passed an official constitution for the Congress, which created a system of two national committees and numerous local units, all working to mobilize a spirit of non-cooperation across India. Gandhi and other volunteers traveled around India further establishing this new grass roots organization, which achieved great success. The new British Viceory in India, Lord Reading, did not dare to interfere because of Gandhi's immense popularity.

By 1922, Gandhi decided that the initiative of non-cooperation had to transform into open civil disobedience, but in March 1922, Lord Reading finally ordered Gandhi's arrest after a crowd in the city of Chauri Chaura attacked and killed the local representatives of British authority. Gandhi, who had never encouraged or sanctioned this type of conduct, condemned the actions of the violent crowds and retreated into a period of fasting and prayer as a response to this violent outburst. However, the British saw the event as a trigger point and a reason for his arrest.

=== Part V ===
The British authorities placed Gandhi on trial for sedition and sentenced him to six years in prison, marking the first time that he faced prosecution in India. Because of Gandhi's fame, the judge, C.N. Broomfield, hesitated to impose a harsher punishment. He considered Gandhi clearly guilty as charged, despite the fact that Gandhi admitted his guilt and even went as far as requesting the heaviest possible sentence. Such willingness to accept imprisonment conformed to his philosophy of satyagraha, so Gandhi felt that his time in prison only furthered his commitment and goals. The authorities allowed him to use a spinning wheel and receive reading materials while in prison, so he felt content. He also wrote most of his autobiography while serving his sentence.

However, in Gandhi's absence, Indians returned to their British jobs and their every day routines. Even worse, the unity between Muslims and Hindu, which Gandhi advocated so passionately, had already begun to fall apart to the point where the threat of violence loomed large over many communities with mixed population. The fight for Indian independence could not continue while Indians themselves suffered disunity and conflict, all the more difficult to overcome in a huge country like India, which had always suffered religious divisions, as well as divisions by language, and even caste.

Gandhi realized that Independence and that the British had lost the will and power to sustain their empire, but he always acknowledged that Indians could not rely simply on the weakening of Britain in order to achieve independence. He believed that Indians had to become morally ready for Independence. He planned to contribute to such readiness through his speeches and writing, advocating humility, restraint, good sanitation, as well as an end to child marriages. He acknowledged that he had changed his position on many issues, like child marriages, and that he had not always managed to discern the most moral course of action in his life.

After his imprisonment ended, he resumed his personal quest for purification and truth. He ends his autobiography by admitting that he continues to experience and fight with "the dormant passion" that lie within his own soul. He felt ready to continue the long and difficult path of taming those passions and putting himself last among his fellow human beings, the only way to achieve salvation, according to him.

"That is why the worlds' praise fails to move me; indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions is far harder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms,"

Gandhi writes in his "Farewell" to the readers, a suitable conclusion for an autobiography that he never intended to be an autobiography, but a tale of experiments with life, and with truth.

After its initiation, ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' remained in the making for 4–5 years (including the time while Gandhi was imprisoned at [[Yerwada Central Jail]] near [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]]), and then it first appeared as a series in the weekly Gujarati magazine ''Navjivan'' during 1925–1928, which was published from Ahmedabad, India.

''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' was first published in the United States in 1948 by Public Affairs Press of Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = Books and Authors| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1948-04-21| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1948/04/21/archives/books-and-authors.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| title = BOOK PUBLISHER MORRIS SCHNAPPER DIES AT AGE 86| work = Washington Post| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1999-02-07| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/02/07/book-publisher-morris-schnapper-dies-at-age-86/185925ba-2fcd-46ec-98ef-031ff9566331/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">A '''time server''' is a [[server (computing)|server]] [[computer]] that reads the actual time from a [[clock signal|reference clock]] and distributes this information to its clients using a computer network. The time server may be a local network time server or an internet time server.

The most important and widely used protocol for distributing and synchronising time over the Internet is the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), though other less-popular or outdated time protocols continue in use. A variety of protocols are in common use for sending time signals over radio links and serial connections.

The time reference used by a time server could be another time server on the network or the Internet, a connected radio clock or an [[atomic clock]]. The most common true time source is a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] or [[Radio clock#GPS_clocks|GPS master clock]]. Time servers are sometimes multi-purpose [[network server]]s, dedicated network servers, or dedicated devices. All a dedicated time server does is provide accurate time.

An existing network server (e.g. a file server) can become a time server with additional software. The NTP homepage provides a free and widely used reference implementation of the NTP server and client for many popular [[operating system]]s.  The other choice is a dedicated time server device.

The term "stratum" is used to label the closeness to a central or high quality time server. The stratum indicates the place of a particular time server in a hierarchy of servers. The scale is 1 to 15 where 1 is the most accurate and likely a highly specialized physical hardware device. Some time clients will reject a time update from a server whose stratum is too high, and most will prefer low strata time sources to higher ones. This can be a pitfall for administrators setting up an in-house time server with no true time source.

{{distinguish|Well-ordering theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''well-ordering principle''' states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a [[least element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Analytic Number Theory |last=Apostol |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom M. Apostol |year=1976 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=0-387-90163-9 |pages=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the set of positive integers is [[well-order]]ed.

The phrase "well-ordering principle" is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the "[[well-ordering theorem]]". On other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of [[integers]] {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} contains a [[well-order|well-ordered]] subset, called the [[natural numbers]], in which every nonempty subset contains a least element.

Depending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced, this (second order) property of the set of natural numbers is either an [[axiom]] or a provable theorem. For example:
* In [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second-order arithmetic]] and related systems, and indeed in most (not necessarily formal) mathematical treatments of the well-ordering principle, the principle is derived from the principle of [[mathematical induction]], which is itself taken as basic. 
* Considering the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers, and assuming that we know already that the real numbers are complete (again, either as an axiom or a theorem about the real number system), i.e., every bounded (from below) set has an infimum, then also every set ''A'' of natural numbers has an infimum, say ''a''*. We can now find an integer ''n''* such that ''a''* lies in the half-open interval (''n''*−1,&amp;nbsp;''n''*], and can then show that we must have ''a''*&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''*, and ''n''* in ''A''. 
* In [[axiomatic set theory]], the natural numbers are defined as the smallest [[Inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]] (i.e., set containing 0 and closed under the successor operation). One can (even without invoking the [[axiom of regularity|regularity axiom]]) show that the set of all natural numbers ''n'' such that "{0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is well-ordered" is inductive, and must therefore contain all natural numbers; from this property one can conclude that the set of all natural numbers is also well-ordered. 

In the second sense, this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form: to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set S, assume the contrary, which implies that the set of counterexamples is non-empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample.  Then show that for any counterexample there is a still smaller counterexample, producing a contradiction.  This mode of argument is the [[contrapositive]] of proof by [[complete induction]]. It is known light-heartedly as the "[[minimal criminal]]" method and is similar in its nature to [[Fermat|Fermat's]] method of "[[infinite descent]]".

[[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] wrote in ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'' that this property, like the [[least upper bound axiom]] for real numbers, is non-algebraic; i.e., it cannot be deduced from the algebraic properties of the integers (which form an ordered [[integral domain]]).
