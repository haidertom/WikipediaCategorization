Nitrogen, acting as an oxidant, is therefore reduced in a succession of four reactions performed by the enzymes [[Nitrate reductase|nitrate]], [[Nitrite reductase|nitrite]], [[Nitric-oxide reductase|nitric-oxide]], and [[Nitrous-oxide reductase|nitrous oxide]] reductases.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  The pathway ultimately yields reduced molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as, when the reaction does not reach completion, the intermediate species [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  A simple [[denitrification]] reaction proceeds as:

:{{chem|NO|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO →  {{chem|N|2|O}} → {{chem|N|2}} (g)

The [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reaction which utilizes oxygen as the oxidant is:

:{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} (aq) + 6{{chem|O|2}} (g) → 6{{chem|CO|2}} (g) + 6{{chem|H|2|O|}}

Classically, it was thought that denitrification would not occur in the presence of oxygen since there seems to be no energetic advantage to using nitrate as an oxidant when oxygen is available.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  Experiments have since proven that denitrifiers are often [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=William H.|year=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-625155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aerobic denitrification does indeed occur in a broad range of [[Denitrifying bacteria|microbial organisms]] with varying levels of productivity, usually lower productivity than results from purely aerobic respiration.  The advantages of being able to perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen are uncertain, though it is possible that the ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels plays a role.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt; Aerobic denitrification may be found in environments where fluctuating oxygen concentrations and reduced carbon are available&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relative harsh environment inspires the potential of denitrifiers to degrade toxic nitrate or nitrate under an aerobic atmosphere. Aerobic denitrifiers tend to work efficiently at 25 ~ 37°C and pH 7 ~ 8, when dissolved oxygen concentration is 3 ~ 5 mg/L and C/N load ratio is 5 ~ 10&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

==Environmental impact==

=== Wastewater treatment ===
Water treatment often relies on the activity of [[Denitrification|anaerobically denitrifying bacteria]] in order to remove [[nitrate]] from water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lv|first=Pengyi|last2=Luo|first2=Jinxue|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xuliang|last4=Zhang|first4=Dongqing|last5=Huang|first5=Zhanbin|last6=Bai|first6=Zhihui|date=2017-08-30|title=Diversity of culturable aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the sediment, water and biofilms in Liangshui River of Beijing, China|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09556-9|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09556-9|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of oxygen, nitrate cannot be fully reduced to [[dinitrogen]], thus nitrate remains in the water or it is converted to nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lingering nitrate in drinking water poses a plethora of health risks, and both nitrate and nitrous oxide have major environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Alyce M.|last2=Diaz|first2=James H.|last3=Kaye|first3=Alan David|date=2014|title=Reexamining the Risks of Drinking-Water Nitrates on Public Health|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=392–398|issn=1524-5012|pmc=4171798|pmid=25249806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Emma L.|last2=Allison|first2=Steven D.|date=2012-07-31|title=Meta-Analysis of Environmental Impacts on Nitrous Oxide Release in Response to N Amendment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00272|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3408851|pmid=22866053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hazards include, [[carcinogen]]ic nitrate ions in drinking water, or [[eutrophication]] caused by oxidized nitrogen seeding [[Algal bloom]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=David|date=1993-10-01|title=Aerobic denitrification in soils and sediments: From fallacies to factx|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016953479390218E|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=8|issue=10|pages=352–356|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90218-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely aerobic denitrification can further reduce oxidized nitrogen in a less specialized environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, many aerobically denitrifying bacteria from the [[pseudomonas]] genus (''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri|Pm. stutzeri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas mendocina|Pm. mendocina]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas putida|Pm. Putida]])'' were shown to be isolated from the [[Lingshui River|Liangshui river]] in China, and could be further used in [[bioaugmentation]] to clear contaminated water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Pseudomas,  ''[[Acinetobacter]] sp.'' SYF26 was isolated from the [[Heihe|Hei He]] reservoir in [[China]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su|first=Jun-feng|last2=Zhang|first2=Kai|last3=Huang|first3=Ting-lin|last4=Wen|first4=Gang|last5=Guo|first5=Lin|last6=Yang|first6=Shao-fei|date=2015|title=Heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification at low nutrient conditions by a newly isolated bacterium, Acinetobacter sp.

==== Global warming ====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is a 200-300 times more potent [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]], accounting for 5% of the global green house gas effect.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takaya|first=Naoki|last2=Catalan-Sakairi|first2=Maria|last3=Sakaguchi|first3=Yasushi|last4=Kato|first4=Isao|last5=Zhou|first5=Zhemin|last6=Shoun|first6=Hirofumi|date=June 2003|title=Aerobic Denitrification Bacteria That Produce Low Levels of Nitrous Oxide|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/69/6/3152.full.pdf|journal=American Society for Microbiology|volume=|pages=3152–3157|via=http://aem.asm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reduction of nitrate in [[wastewater treatment]], nitrous oxide is only released in the absence of appropriate [[oxygen]] regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some solutions to combat the release of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment could be to use aerobically denitrifying organisms with the capacity to fully reduce nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, ''[[Pseudomonas denitrificans|P. Denitrificans]]'' has shown to efficiently reduce nitrate to [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in cultured media and wastewater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, TR2 strains of [[Pseudomonas stutzeri|P. sturzeri]] and [[Pseudomonas]] sp. strain K50 were also shown to have substantially low levels of nitrous oxide production in [[water treatment]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus enriching [[activated sludge]] for aerobic denitrifying bacteria can be effective in combating the global warming effects of nitrous oxide in [[wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''American Society for Legal History''' is a learned society dedicated to promoting scholarship and teaching in the field of [[legal history]]. It was founded in 1956 and has an international scope, despite being based in [[the United States]]. It sponsors the [[peer-review]]ed journal ''[[Law and History Review]]'' and the book series ''Studies in Legal History'', both of which are published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/aslh |title=American Society for Legal History |website=Cambridge Core |language=en |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the Society established the ''[[American Journal of Legal History]]'', which the Society originally published as its official journal. The journal was later acquired by the [[Temple University Beasley School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv7sAgAAQBAJ |title=Journals of the Century |last=Cole |first=Jim |last2=Stankus |first2=Tony |date=2014-02-25 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317720140|page=236 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.acls.org/ |title=American Society for Legal History |website=American Council of Learned Societies |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Apophthegmata Patrum''''' (lit. '''''Sayings of the Fathers''''')&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek: ''apo'', from; ''phtheggomai'', to cry out; ''pater, father''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-la|Apophthegmata Patrum Aegyptiorum}} {{lang-el|ἀποφθέγματα τῶν ἁγίων γερόντων, ἀποφθέγματα τῶν πατέρων, τὸ γεροντικόν}})&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox Encyclopedia, in Russian, Vol. 3, pp. 140-142.''&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to various collections popularly known as of ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', consisting of stories and sayings attributed to the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] from approximately the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Graham|title=Papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies held in Oxford 1999|series=Studia Patristica|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0922-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''W. Bousset. Apophthegmata. Tuebingen, 1923, p. 68.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an [[oral tradition]] in the [[Coptic language]], they were only later written down as Greek text. The stories were extremely popular among early Christian monks, and appeared in various forms and collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burton-Christie, Douglas |title=The Word in the desert: scripture and the quest for holiness in early Christian monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1993|pages=76–84 |isbn=0-19-508333-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIa0mNas_5MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original sayings were passed down from monk to monk, though in their current version most simply describe the stories in the form of "Abba X said...." The early Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers also received many visitors seeking counseling, typically by asking "Give me a word, ''abba''" or "Speak a word, ''amma'', how can I be saved?" Some of the sayings are responses to those seeking guidance.&lt;ref name="Chryssavgis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chryssavgis, John |author2=Ware, Kallistos |author3=Ward, Benedicta |title=In the Heart of the Desert: Revised Edition: The Spirituality of the Desert Fathers and Mothers (Treasures of the World's Religions) |publisher=World Wisdom |page=4|location=Bloomington, Ind. |year=2008|isbn=1-933316-56-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goeFHFiL2h0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable Desert Fathers are mentioned in the collections, including [[Anthony the Great]], [[Arsenius the Great|Abba Arsenius]], [[Abba Poemen]], [[Macarius of Egypt|Abba Macarius of Egypt]], and Abba [[Moses the Black]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chryssavgis, pp. 19-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The sayings also include those of three different ''ammas'', or Desert Mothers, most notably [[Syncletica of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Chryssavgis" /&gt; ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' influenced many notable theologians, including [[Saint Jerome]] and [[Saint Augustine]].&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flood, Gavin D. |title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-521-60401-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3s8zRmr-e8C&amp;pg=PA148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the text==
The Desert Fathers spoke [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a language related to ancient Egyptian. The sayings were originally passed on orally in that language. The earliest written record of the sayings appears to be from the end of the 4th century AD. Two versions from the 5th century, the ''[[Ethiopic Collectio Monastica|Collectio Monastica]]'', written in [[Ethiopic]], and the [[Asceticon|Asceticon of Abba Isaiah]], written in Greek, show how the oral tradition became the written collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie" /&gt;

[[Pelagius]] and [[John the Deacon (Egyptian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] made the first translations of the ''Sayings'' into Latin. [[Martin of Braga]] also translated some of the sayings into Latin, followed by a more extensive translation by Paschasius of Dumium in approximately 555 AD.&lt;ref name="Iberian"&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, Claude |title=Fathers of the Church: Iberian Fathers: Martin of Braga/Paschasius of Dumium/Leander of Seville |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1969 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-8132-0062-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HaChb7wjNDkC&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Waddell]] translated a selection of elements from the ''Vitae Patrum'' into English in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The desert fathers'' (translations from the ''Vitae Patrum''), London: Constable &amp; co., 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete translation of the "apothegmata" into English is that of [[Benedicta Ward]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Benedicta Ward, ''The sayings of the Desert Fathers : the alphabetical collection'', Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1975 (revised edition, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''archegonium''' (pl: '''archegonia'''), from the [[ancient Greek]] ''ἀρχή'' ("beginning") and ''γόνος'' ("offspring"), is a multicellular structure or organ of the [[gametophyte]] phase of certain [[plant]]s, producing and containing the [[ovum]] or female [[gamete]]. The corresponding male organ is called the [[antheridium]]. The archegonium has a long neck canal or venter and a swollen base. Archegonia are typically located on the surface of the plant [[thallus]], although in the [[hornwort]]s they are embedded. 

==Bryophytes==
In [[bryophytes]] and other [[cryptogam]]s sperm reach the archegonium by swimming in water films, whereas in [[Pinophyta]] and [[Angiosperms]] the [[pollen]] are delivered by wind or animal vectors and the sperm are delivered by means of a [[pollen tube]].

==Gymnosperms==
They are much-reduced and embedded in the megagametophytes of [[gymnosperm]]s. The term is not used for [[angiosperm]]s or the gnetophytes ''[[Gnetum]]'' and ''[[Welwitschia]]'' because the megagametophyte is reduced to just a few cells, one of which differentiates into the egg cell. The function of surrounding the gamete is assumed in large part by [[diploid]] cells of the [[megasporangium]] ([[nucellus]]) inside the [[ovule]]. [[Gymnosperms]] have their archegonium formed after [[pollination]] inside female [[conifer cone]]s (megastrobili).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/botany/repro_gymnosperms.html Brooklyn Botanic Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
{{Weather}}
'''Atmospheric sciences''' are the study of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], its processes, the effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere on these other systems. [[Meteorology]] includes [[atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmospheric physics]] with a major focus on [[weather forecasting]]. [[Climatology]] is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic [[climate change|climate variability]]. [[Aeronomy]] is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of [[planetary science]] and the study of the atmospheres of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]].

Experimental instruments used in atmospheric sciences include [[satellite]]s, [[rocketsonde]]s, [[radiosonde]]s, [[weather balloon]]s, and [[laser]]s.

The term '''aerology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀήρ, ''aēr'', "[[air]]"; and -λογία, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere. Early pioneers in the field include [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] and [[Richard Assmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17 Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system] By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric chemistry ==

[[File:Atmosphere composition diagram-en.svg|left|thumb|250px]]
{{main|Atmospheric chemistry}}
Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.

The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== Atmospheric dynamics ==
{{see also|Synoptic scale meteorology}}
Atmospheric dynamics involves the study of observations and theory dealing with all motion systems of meteorological importance. Common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as [[thunderstorms]], [[tornado]]es, [[gravity wave]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[extratropical cyclone]]s, [[jet stream]]s, and global-scale circulations. The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from [[physics]]. The objectives of such studies incorporate improving [[weather forecasting]], developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Washington]]. [http://www.atmos.washington.edu/academic/atmosdyn.html Atmospheric Dynamics.] Retrieved on 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric physics ==
{{main|Atmospheric physics}}
Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth's atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, [[wave propagation]] models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and spatial [[statistics]], each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.

In the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving atmospheric physics. The [[U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere.

The [[Earth's magnetic field]] and the [[solar wind]] interact with the atmosphere, creating the [[ionosphere]], [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[telluric current]]s, and [[radiant energy]].

== Climatology ==

[[File:El_Nino_regional_impacts.png|thumb|250px|Regional impacts of warm ENSO episodes (El Niño).]]
{{main|Climatology}}
In contrast to [[meteorology]], which studies short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[List of climate scientists|Climatologists]], those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates&amp;nbsp;– local, regional or global&amp;nbsp;– and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].

Phenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the [[oceans]] and [[Landform|land]] surface (particularly [[vegetation]], [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include [[astrophysics]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ecology]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[glaciology]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], and [[volcanology]].

[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Earth's atmosphere]]
All of the Solar System's planets have atmospheres.  This is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface.  Larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into [[space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sheppard |first1=S.

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s ([[Climate of Mars|on Mars]]), an Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).&lt;ref name=Weather&gt;{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=1 May 2006 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808201459/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |archivedate=8 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.&lt;ref name="knutson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knutson |first=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b |journal=Nature |year=2007 |volume=447 |pages=183–6 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K |arxiv=0705.0993}} (Related [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2007/pr200713.html press release])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Most often it is used to name the general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface. However, in practice this phenomenon is usually split into the reflected and transmitted components, which are then treated separately as '''BRDF''' ('''[[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]]''') and '''BTDF''' ('''bidirectional transmittance distribution function''').

[[Image:BSDF05 800.png|thumb|right|280px|BSDF: BRDF + BTDF]]

* '''BSDF''' is a superset and the generalization of the '''BRDF''' and '''BTDF'''. The concept behind all BxDF functions could be described as a black box with the inputs being any two angles, one for incoming (incident) ray and the second one for the outgoing (reflected or transmitted) ray at a given point of the surface. The output of this black box is the value defining the ratio between the incoming and the outgoing light energy for the given couple of angles. The content of the black box may be a mathematical formula which more or less accurately tries to model and approximate the actual surface behavior or an algorithm which produces the output based on discrete samples of measured data. This implies that the function is 4 (+1) dimensional (4 values for 2 3D angles + 1 optional for wavelength of the light), which means that it cannot be simply represented by 2D and not even by a 3D graph. Each 2D or 3D graph, sometimes seen in the literature, shows only a slice of the function.
* Some tend to use the term '''BSDF''' simply as a category name covering the whole family of BxDF functions.
* The term '''BSDF''' is sometimes used in a slightly different context, for the function describing the amount of the scatter (not scattered light), simply as a function of the incident light angle. An example to illustrate this context: for perfectly lambertian surface the BSDF (angle)=const. This approach is used for instance to verify the output quality by the manufacturers of the glossy surfaces.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}
* Another recent usage of the term '''BSDF''' can be seen in some 3D packages, when vendors use it as a 'smart' category to encompass the simple well known cg algorithms like [[Phong reflection model|Phong]], [[Blinn–Phong reflection model|Blinn–Phong]] etc.

&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the last key breakthroughs on the way to fully [[virtual cinematography]] with its ultra-photorealistic [[digital look-alike]]s. The team was the first in the world to isolate the [[subsurface scattering]] component (a specialized case of BTDF) using the simplest [[light stage]], consisting on moveable light source, moveable high-res [[digital camera]], 2 [[polarizers]] in a few positions and really simple [[algorithm]]s on a modest [[computer]].&lt;ref name="Deb2000"/&gt; The team utilized the existing scientific knowledge that [[light]] that is reflected and scattered from the air-to-oil layer retains its [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] while light that travels within the [[skin]] loses its polarization.&lt;ref name="Deb2000"/&gt;  The subsurface scattering component can be [[computer simulation|simulated]] as a steady high-scatter glow of light from within the [[3D model|model]]s, without which the skin does not look realistic. [[ESC Entertainment]], a company set up by [[Warner Brothers Pictures]] specially to do the visual effects / virtual cinematography system for  [[The Matrix Reloaded]] and [[The Matrix Revolutions]] isolated the parameters for an approximate analytical BRDF which consisted of [[lambertian]] [[diffuse|diffusion]] component and a modified [[specular]] [[phong reflection model|Phong]] component with a [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel]] type of [[Visual effects|effect]].&lt;ref name="HaD2004"&gt;{{cite web

==Etymology==
The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the year 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''&lt;ref name="Dasmann1968"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond Fredric |last=Dasmann|title=A Different Kind of Country|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DgM2jwEACAAJ}}|year=1968|publisher=Collier Books|isbn=978-0-02-072810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term "biological diversity".

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]&lt;ref name="WilsonSciences1988"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.O. |last1=Wilson|title=Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DSGF1xQBYi8C}}|date=1 January 1988|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-03739-6}} [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154719/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of that forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy-makers|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKnimgEACAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56481-6}} Annex 6, Glossary. Used as source by [http://www.biodiv.be/glossary_keywords/B "Biodiversity", Glossary of terms related to the CBD], [[Belgium|Belgian]] Clearing-House Mechanism. Retrieved 2006-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders and concerned citizens.

A similar term in the United States is ''"natural heritage."'' It pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- I've never come across this term--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/|title=Massachusetts Natural Heritage &amp; Endangered Species Program|last=NHESP|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]]. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species and [[ecosystems]] of a region".&lt;ref name="Larsson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:

* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|accessdate = 2015-12-22|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;

The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

One textbook's definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization".&lt;ref name="GastonSpicer2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels. However, [[tetrapod]] (terrestrial [[vertebrates]]) taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation.&lt;!-- what does this even mean???--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry  | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/22/rsbl.2009.1024.abstract| volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–7 | pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally.  [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages =  1771–1792 |format=PDF | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the [[fractal]] biodiversity") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2016). The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. Biologia, 71(6), 669-672.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises up to three moving towards the [[equator]].

===Hotspots===
A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | url = | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages =  1098–1101 |format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

[[Brazil]]'s [[Atlantic Forest]] is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Forest of South America: Biodiversity Status, Threats, and Outlook|last=Galindo-Leal|first=Carlos|publisher=Island Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55963-988-0|location=Washington|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The island of [[Madagascar]] and India are also particularly notable. [[Colombia]] is characterized by high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth can be found in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world's mammals species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]]. The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |accessdate=2009-06-21 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started out poor, became richer over time - Welcome to Bio-X|website=biox.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–94 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in his ''Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory'',  [[Roberto Cazzolla Gatti]] proposed that species themselves are the architects of biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available niches in a given ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2011). Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why. Theoretical Biology Forum, 104(1), 35-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study led to the idea that biodiversity is [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., &amp; Kauffman, S. (2017). Biodiversity is autocatalytic. Ecological Modelling, 346, 70-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[ecosystem]] of interdependent [[species]] can be, therefore, considered as an [[Emergent properties|emergent]] [[autocatalytic set]] (a self-sustaining network of mutually "[[catalytic]]" entities), where one (group of) species enables the existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in the same ecosystem.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

===The balance of evidence===
"Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal| url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/10240/7/wardle_d_etal_130415.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all ecosystems. It is as if the natural world is an enormous bank account of capital assets capable of paying life sustaining dividends indefinitely, but only if the capital is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Richard T., and Bernard J. Nebel.&amp;nbsp;''Environmental Science : toward a Sustainable Future''. Eighth ed., Upper Saddle River, N.J., Pearson Education, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

These services come in three flavors:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniel|first=T. C.|title=Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=21 May 2012|volume=109|issue=23|pages=8812–8819|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114773109|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8812D |display-authors=etal|pmid=22615401|pmc=3384142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems"&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point.

(2009) [http://www.cbd.int/climate/ "Climate Change and Biological Diversity"] Convention on Biological Diversity Retrieved 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health.

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific Reports | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name="LivingPlanetReport2014"&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |accessdate=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in ''[[PLOS One]]'' found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of [[Sussex University]] stated that their study suggested that humans "appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers|title=Warning of 'ecological Armageddon' after dramatic plunge in insect numbers|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2017|last1=Editor|first1=Damian Carrington Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Sign for biodiversity, Extinction Rebellion (cropped).jpg|thumb|Habitat loss, climate change, overconsumption and pollution are major threats to biodiversity.]]

In 2006, many species were formally classified as [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]]; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria are now listed as threatened with [[extinction]]—a total of 16,119.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/0502_060502_endangered.html|title = Endangered Species List Expands to 16,000|accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170805153429/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/0502_060502_endangered.html#|archivedate = 5 August 2017|work = National Geographic|last = Lovett|first = Richard A.|date = 2 May 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00848.x | title = The imprint of the geographical, evolutionary and ecological context on species-area relationships | year = 2006 | last1 = Drakare | first1 = Stina | last2 = Lennon | first2 = Jack J. | last3 = Hillebrand | first3 = Helmut | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–227 | pmid = 16958886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to "trivial" standardized ecosystems (e.g., [[monoculture]] following [[deforestation]]) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity - through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and "pests", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).{{Citation needed|date= August 2010}}

A 2007 study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and ''vice versa''. "If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species."&lt;!-- the quote doesn't talk about genetic diversity --&gt;&lt;ref name=enn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/23391 |title= Study: Loss Of Genetic Diversity Threatens Species Diversity |publisher= Enn.com |date= 2007-09-26 |accessdate= 2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of | 2005 |alt = At present}}, the most threatened ecosystems occur in [[fresh water]], according to the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] 2005, which was confirmed by the "Freshwater Animal Diversity Assessment" organised by the [[GBIF|biodiversity platform]] and the French ''[[Institut de recherche pour le développement]]'' (MNHNP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceconnection.be/ Science Connection 22] (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-extinctions are a form of habitat destruction. Co-extinction occurs when the extinction or decline in one species accompanies similar processes in another, such as in plants and beetles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Introduced and invasive species===
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
[[File:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3=[[Dobson, Andrew P.]] |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J. M.|title=Species Diversity and Biological Invasions: Relating Local Process to Community Pattern|journal=Science|date=5 May 2000|volume=288|issue=5467|pages=852–854|doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.852|bibcode = 2000Sci...288..852L|pmid=10797006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is, "do invasive species cause extinctions?" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GUREVITCH|first=J|author2=PADILLA, D|title=Are invasive species a major cause of extinctions?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1 September 2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=470–474|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.005|pmid=16701309}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones.

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution.

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name="bulletin28" /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801074239/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.ht…|date=1 August 2012|archivedate=1 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]].
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;via tree nurseries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
*Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Protected areas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dolomitipark.it/doc_pdf/parchi.sola.terra/07.ProtectedAreas_Biodiversity.pdf|title=Protected Areas and Biodiversity: An Overview of Key Issues|last=Mulongoy|first=Kalemani Jo|last2=Chape|first2=Stuart|publisher=CBD Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC|year=2004|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, UK|pages=15 and 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|pmid=30213888|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National parks===
{{Main|National park}}
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
[[Wildlife sanctuary|Wildlife sanctuaries]] aim only at conservation of species and have the following features:

#The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
#The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
#Private ownership may be allowed.
#[[Forestry]] and other usages can also be permitted.

===Forest reserves===
The [[forest]]s play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:

#They are large inaccessible forests.
#Many of these are unoccupied.
#They are ecologically and economically less important.

====Steps to conserve the forest cover====
{{see|forest cover}}
#An extensive [[reforestation]]/[[afforestation]] program should be followed.
#Alternative [[environment-friendly]] sources of fuel energy such as [[biogas]] other than wood should be used.
#Loss of biodiversity due to [[forest fire]] is a major problem, immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
#[[Overgrazing]] by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
#Hunting and [[poaching]] should be banned.

===Zoological parks===
In [[zoological park]]s or zoos, live animals are kept for public [[recreation]], education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities, provide opportunities for threatened species to [[captive breeding|breed in captivity]] and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care. Zoos play a major role in creating [[environmental awareness|awareness]] about the need to conserve nature.

===Botanical gardens===
In [[botanical garden]]s, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown outdoors or under glass in [[greenhouse]]s and conservatories. In addition, a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or [[herbarium]] and such facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental or research plantings.

==Resource allocation==
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=conservationists-triage-determine-which-endangered-species-to-save Conservationists Use Triage to Determine which Species to Save and Not; Like battlefield medics, conservationists are being forced to explicitly apply triage to determine which creatures to save and which to let go] 23 July 2012 ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones-Walters | first1 = L. | last2 = Mulder | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1016/j.jnc.2009.06.001 | title = Valuing nature: The economics of biodiversity | journal = Journal for Nature Conservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–247 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | url=http://mdvnaturalist.com/images/econmics_of_biodiversity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|right|A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], [[Australia]] while continuing to allow visitor access.]]

===International===
* United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (1992) and [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]];
* Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]);
* [[Ramsar Convention]] (Wetlands);
* [[Bonn Convention]] on Migratory Species;
* [[World Heritage Convention]] (indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats)
* Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
* Bilateral agreements such as the [[Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement]].

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.

India passed the [[Biological Diversity Act]] in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

==Analytical limits==

===Taxonomic and size relationships===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x | author = Wilson Edward O | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is "firmly fixated on the visible [macroscopic] world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/429804a | author = Nee S | year = 2004 | title = More than meets the eye | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6994| pages = 804–805 | pmid = 15215837 |bibcode = 2004Natur.429..804N }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, microbial life is [[metabolically]] and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., [[extremophile]]). "On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit [[ribosomal RNA]], visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder—to a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/448657a | bibcode=2007Natur.448..657S | title = Biodiversity: World of insects | year = 2007 | last1 = Stork | first1 = Nigel E. | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7154 | pages = 657–658 | pmid = 17687315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1095046 | author = Thomas J.

== Diversity study (botany) ==
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as ''simple sequence repeats'' (SSR) were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild relatives.

In the case of [[cowpea]], a study conducted to assess the level of genetic diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and revealing the center of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunkanmi|first=Liasu Adebayo|date=|title=Genetic diversity of cowpea and its wild relatives|url=|journal=Unilag SPGS (Thesis &amp; Dissertation 1970-2012)|volume=|pages=144–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">The term '''building engineering physics''' was introduced in a report released in January 2010 commissioned by The Royal Academy of Engineering. The report, entitled ''Engineering a Low Carbon Built Environment: The Discipline of Building Engineering Physics'',  presents the initiative of many at the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in developing a field that addresses our [[fossil fuel]] dependence while working towards a more sustainably built environment for the future.

The field of building engineering physics combines the existing professions of building services engineering, [[applied physics]] and building construction engineering into a single field designed to investigate the energy efficiency of old and new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;King p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of building engineering physics allows the construction and renovation of high performance, energy efficient buildings, while minimizing their environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

Building engineering physics addresses several different areas in building performance including: air movement, thermal performance, control of moisture, ambient energy, acoustics, light, climate and biology.&lt;ref&gt;King pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; This field employs creative ways of manipulating these principal aspects of a building’s indoor and outdoor environments so that a more eco-friendly standard of living is obtained. Building engineering physics is unique from other established applied sciences or engineering professions as it combines the sciences of architecture, engineering and human biology and physiology. Building engineering physics not only addresses energy efficiency and building sustainability, but also a building's internal environment conditions that affect the comfort and performance levels of its occupants.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, a large percentage of buildings were constructed completely dependent on fossil fuels. Rather than focusing on energy efficiency, architects and engineers were more concerned with experimenting with “new materials and structural forms” to further aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the 21st century, building energy performance standards are pushing towards a zero carbon standard in old and new buildings alike. The threat of global change and the need for energy independence and sustainability has prompted governments across the globe to adopt firm carbon reducing standards.  A significant way to meet these stringent standards is in the construction of buildings that minimize environmental impacts, as well as the refurbishing of older buildings to meet carbon emission standards.  The application of building engineering physics can aid in this transition to reduce energy dependent buildings, provide for the demands of a growing population and better standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the application of this field is due in large part to the'' introduction of regulations requiring the calculation of carbon emissions to demonstrate compliance, principally the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)''.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the discipline of building engineering physics is severely impaired by lack of diverse education in the construction industry. Very few in the construction industry know how to apply the principles of building engineering physics and do not have interdisciplinary experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COSI''' (an acronym for '''C'''enter '''o'''f '''S'''cience and '''I'''ndustry) is a [[science museum]] and [[research center]] located in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in the [[United States]]. Originally opened in 1964, COSI was relocated to a 320,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility designed by Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]] along a bend in the [[Scioto River]] in the [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] neighborhood in 1999. COSI features more than 300 interactive exhibits throughout themed exhibition areas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi|title=About COSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a “center of science and industry” (rather than a standalone “science center”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/downloads/about/center-of-science.pdf|title=COSI's Center of Science Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI established embedded partnerships with local organizations. [[WOSU-FM|WOSU]]@COSI (Central Ohio’s [[NPR]] member station and [[Public Broadcasting Service]] public media station) maintains a digital media center and offices; [[Ohio State University|OSU]] maintains a center of research as well as health &amp; medicine laboratories staffed by medical residents; and Columbus Historical Society maintains offices and exhibit space.

COSI also operates the largest outreach education program of any science museum in the United States through COSI in the Classroom, 21st Century Lab field trip experiences, international [[distance education]] Interactive Video Conferencing programs, and COSI On Wheels traveling outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/educators|title=COSI - For Educators}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, COSI originated the Camp-In overnight program for [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] in 1972 – a concept that is now commonplace in museums nationwide. Since 1964, COSI has engaged with nearly 30 million unique visitors through on-site and outreach programs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

As a [[not-for-profit organization]], COSI is supported by ticket sales, a network of community and statewide partnerships (including relationships with a variety of donors and sponsors), a volunteer program supported by 10,000 volunteers annually, and nearly 20,000 member households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/volunteer-employment|title=Volunteer &amp; Employment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, COSI was the named the #1 science center in the United States for families by Parent Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/vacation/us-destinations/best-science-centers/|title=Parents Magazine - 10 Best Science CentersI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
[[Image:AUT 0344.JPG|thumb|The museum's [[Foucault pendulum]], located at the facility's west entrance.]]
''As adopted in 1964...'' "COSI provides an exciting and informative atmosphere for those of all ages to discover more about our environment, our accomplishments, our heritage, and ourselves. We motivate a desire toward a better understanding of science, industry, health, and history through involvement in exhibits, demonstrations, and a variety of educational activities and experiences. COSI is for the enrichment of the individual and for a more rewarding life on our planet, Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi/|title=COSI - Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit areas==
Upon relocating to its new home in 1999, COSI was developed with large, self-contained, [[theming|themed]] atria, each dedicated to a single topic (similar to the style of [[world’s fair]] pavilions) and designed as immersive theatrical “learning worlds.” As of 2018, COSI contains seven main exhibit areas: Ocean, Energy Explorers, Space, Progress, Gadgets, Life, and the American Museum of National History Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/exhibits|title=COSI - Exhibits &amp; Live Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallways between each learning world are filled with hands-on exhibits and displays.

===Ocean===
The Ocean exhibit is divided into two realms. Accessed via an “underwater cave” through a crashed shipwreck, the cavern path splits as guests pass to the right or left. The pathway to the right leads to a docked [[submarine]] laboratory where hands-on exhibits explore the realities of ocean research, submersibles, SCUBA, water pressure, and remote-operated vehicles. Lilypad Lab focuses on [[drainage basin]] and Central Ohio wildlife. The path forking left from the shipwreck leads to the Temple of Poseidon, an “ancient” stone chamber built around a 30-foot tall statue of [[Poseidon]] with waterfalls, fountains, and water jets. This second realm focuses not on the study of water, but on the properties of water and the stories it inspires – [[laminar flow]], whirlpools, erosion, water bells, and mythology.

===Energy Explorers===
Energy Explorers, which opened in 2013, allows visitors to choose an [[avatar|avatar (computing)]] character that follows the guest to the Home Zone, Transportation Zone, and Product Zone of a town, making decisions via computer kiosks to balance energy efficiency and cost.

===Space===
The Space exhibit area features a replica space station pod to tour, a recreation of [[John Glenn]]'s Friendship 7 spacecraft from the [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], remote-operated vehicles, balance tests, and other hands-on experiments that deal with space flight trajectory, gravitational pull, and simulated rover landings. Space was originally located on Level 2 in its own enclosed atrium exhibit area, entered via a "black hole" spinning funhouse hallway meant to disorient guests. The exhibit itself - like Ocean or Adventure - was in a dark, immersive, themed area, stylized after the 1969 moon landing of [[Apollo 11]]. Under starry skies, guests interacted with "retro" stylized monitors and exhibits with a matching wood-panel / brushed metal motif that was reminiscent of the era and united in style. The exhibit even included a 1960s living room (including shag carpeting) where guests could watch the recorded landing.

When the south end of COSI's building was closed due to lost levies in 2004, the Space exhibit was cut off. As such, it was relocated from Level 2 to an empty gallery on Level 1. In 2012, that area underwent construction to become Energy Explorers, necessitating yet another location switch. Some of the Space exhibit's displays moved to the Mezzanine Level while much remained in storage. With the re-opening of COSI's '''Planetarium''' in November 2014, the location of Space on the Mezzanine leading toward the Planetarium's lobby was reinforced by the return and refurbishment of the rest of Space's exhibits. However, Space still remains the only one of COSI's seven learning worlds to not have its own dedicated, theatrical, immersive atrium, instead being located on the bright Mezzanine bridge, open to the Atrium and entryway. The original home of Space is now Gallery 3, available for traveling exhibits and special event rentals. Gallery 3 still contains the ''Galaxy Theater,'' fittingly still painted with murals of planets and stars left over from its time as a live theater for Space.

===Progress===
The Progress exhibit (modeled after the “Streets of Yesteryear” exhibit at COSI’s original location) traces the hopes and fears of a small town called Progress in 1898, just as electricity, horseless carriages, and canned food become available. The recreated town (specifically, the shops, homes, and restaurants at the corner of Hope Street and Fear Street) includes a telegraph office, livery, stable, grocer, apothecary, and clothiers. After visitors walk through Progress in 1898, they turn the corner enter the same intersection of the same town 64 years later in 1962, where a new set of hopes and fears have arisen.

In 1962, the town of Progress includes an appliance store, working TV studio, radio station (where the telegraph office was), department store, diner, and gas station (replacing the livery). At the exit, the exhibit challenges guests to consider how the streets of the village of Progress might look today, and to question why the concept of [[progress (history)|progress]] deserves as much weight in scientific study as that of oceans, space, or energy.

===Gadgets===
The Gadgets exhibit area contains many classic science museum hands-on experiments, such as [[pulleys]], wind tunnels, [[plasmaglobes]], magnets, light bulbs, engines, and counterweights. As well, Gadgets contains the ‘Gadgets Café’, where families are seated and given a “menu” with quick science experiments to choose from. A “take-apart” menu allows visitors to disassemble donated phones, computers, clocks, and other electronic devices, which are recycled afterward.

===Life===
Life explores humanity through three separate areas dedicated to mind, body, and spirit. The ''Mind'' area contains optical illusions, physical illusions, an [[anechoic chamber]], and a posable [[zoetrope]]. ''Spirit'' discusses the concept of birth and death and how human cultures understand them. ''Body'' features interactive health stations where visitors can record their weight, flexibility, and heart rate, then compare their statistics to that of COSI visitors and national averages. Life also contains the ''Labs in Life'', three working medical research pods staffed by [[Ohio State University|OSU]] Health &amp; Medicine students and staff.[[File:Main COSI Columbus Sign 1.jpg|thumb|right]]

=== Dinosaur Gallery ===
On November 19 of 2017, COSI, in partnership with the [[American Museum of Natural History]], opened a permanent Dinosaur Gallery. In addition, a traveling special exhibition gallery opened in Spring of 2018. Together, they will occupy 22,000 square feet on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=Columbus Dispatch|last=Gordon|first=Ken|date=September 16, 2016|work=|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
The building also contains an interactive '''“little kidspace”''' area designed for children up through first grade, the '''National Geographic Giant Screen Theater''' (the largest digital screen in Ohio), and an outdoor '''Big Science Park'''. On November 22, 2014, COSI reopened its 60-foot diameter, 220-seat '''[[Planetarium]]''' (Ohio’s largest) with all new digital projection. In addition, there is a '''History of COSI''' exhibit.

The building also includes three large '''Galleries''' for traveling exhibits and special event hosting, a Dive Theater in Ocean, the Galaxy Theater in Gallery 3 (its name a remnant of when Gallery 3 was once the Space exhibit), the Gadgets Stage, the Atomic Cafe, the Science2Go! retail store, and five meeting rooms utilizing refurbished areas within the former Central High School, which the new COSI location was built around.

==History==
[[File:Central High School 1.jpg|thumb|Historic Central High School is now part of COSI]]
COSI opened on March 29, 1964, as a venture of the Franklin County Historical Society. COSI is a founding member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC) and a long-standing member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC).

From its 1964 opening, COSI was housed in Memorial Hall, a Columbus landmark constructed in 1906. COSI closed at the Memorial Hall location on East Broad Street on September 6, 1999, and re-opened two months later on November 6, 1999, at its new location on the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] riverfront in [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]]. The new, 320,000 square foot facility is one of the largest modern-built science centers in the world. The building was designed by internationally renowned Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]], who designed an elliptical, geometric, "blimp" shaped structure composed of 159 curved concrete panels.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/projects/applications/public/cultural/COSI.cfm|title=High Concrete Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI is designed to appear progressively futuristic from the neighborhood of Franklinton, while from downtown Columbus it uses the exterior of the original Central High School to blend into the city.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"/&gt;

[[Image:COSIHolidayPhoto.JPG|thumb|COSI's Holiday Science of the Season Celebration annually from the day before Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve.]]
Shortly after the move to the riverfront, the museum experienced a shortfall of funds. With an initial construction budget of over $210 million, high maintenance costs of the new facility, "six figure" utility bills, and "lower-than-expected" ticket sales, COSI's reliance on admission revenue proved to be an unsuitable long term plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1388&amp;dat=20040421&amp;id=eodQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3245,2222827|title=COSI Planetarium to go black; other programs scaled back}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the museum spearheaded an effort to assess a property tax levy, chaired by former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] [[John Glenn]]. The levy would have imposed a property tax on residents of [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]], who would receive free admission in return. The levy failed. As a result, the south wing of COSI's "blimp" structure was closed.

As part of the reconfiguration of the museum following the loss of the levy in 2004, COSI opened only five days per week instead of seven. Many of the museum's exhibits were announced to close permanently (though many have re-opened in stages in the years since).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cosi-to-reallocate-exhibit-spaces-in-september-71781782.html|title=COSI to reallocate exhibit spaces in September}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the original exhibit areas were closed permanently (called '''i|o''' and '''SimZone''', the spaces they formerly occupied are now Gallery 1 and Energy Explorers, respectively).

Closures from 2004 that have since been reversed include Space (relocated to Level 1 in 2005, then to the Mezzanine in 2012), the original Gallery 1 (space reused as WOSU@COSI in September 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocio.osu.edu/blog/community/2006/09/28/wosucosi-grand-opening-set-for-september-29|title=WOSU@COSI Grand Opening}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Adventure (re-opened as an additional-charge experience in September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/07/12/COSI_to_reopen_Adventure_exhibit.html|title=COSI to reopen popular Adventure exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt;), CityView (still off limits to the public; now available for special events), and the Planetarium (re-opened in November 2014 as the final piece of the building to come back online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/11/20/cosi-gets-star-attraction.html|title=COSI's renovated planetarium to reopen after decade absence}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Image:Columbus-ohio-cosi-summer.jpg|thumb|COSI from across the Scioto River.]]

During the spring and summer of 2005, COSI hosted the blockbuster traveling exhibition "[[RMS Titanic|Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition]]" and saw record attendance (prompting the return of the exhibit in 2010). In the summer 2006, COSI hosted another large exhibit: "[[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]]", produced by the [[Museum of Science, Boston]].

In April 2006 Dr. David Chesebrough, former president and CEO of the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], became COSI's new president and CEO.  He replaced  former NASA astronaut [[Kathryn D. Sullivan]], who transitioned to a new role as COSI science advisor on a volunteer basis while serving in her new role as the Director of [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy.

Since then, COSI has integrated additional-cost traveling exhibits as part of its funding model. The museum has hosted ''EINSTEIN, An Exhibition on the Man and his Science'' (2007), ''Animation featuring Cartoon Network'' (2007), ''Gregor Mendel: Planting the Seeds of Genetics '' (2007), ''Bob the Builder: Project Build It'' (2007), ''Goosebumps!  The Science of Fear'' (2008), ''CSI: The Experience'' (2008), ''Adventures with Clifford the Big Red Dog'' (2010), ''Geckos: From Tail to Toepads'' (2011), ''Dinosaurs: Explore.  Escape. Survive.'' (2011), Dora and Diego - Let's Explore! (2011), RACE: Are We So Different? (2012), WATER (2012), LEGO Castle Adventure (2012), BODYWORLDS and The Brain (2012), MindBender Mansion and Amazing Mazes (2013), MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition (2013), Curious George: Let's Get Curious! (2013), and Sherlock: The Exhibition (2014). As well, COSI developed its own traveling exhibit, ''Lost Egypt: Ancient Secrets, Modern Science'' (2009) in cooperation with the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, built by the Science Museum of Minnesota.  ''Lost Egypt'' now travels the nation to other museums.

In January 2016, Dr. Chesebrough announced that he planned to retire at the end of 2016.  A executive search firm was contracted, and an advisory committee formed, to identify candidates to succeed him as president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/29/COSI_president_announces_retirement.html|title=President who helped revive COSI announces he'll retire|author=Shannon Gilchrist|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2016, the Capitol South Community Redevelopment Corp. announced the approval of a $37 million plan to replace the 600-spot parking lots on COSI's west side with an underground parking garage topped with an 8-acre green space and programmatic park as a compliment to the larger Scioto Peninsula green space along the [[Scioto River]]. The construction project is expected to be completed in spring 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2016/08/23/cosi-underground-parking-park-okd.html|title=COSI underground parking, park get go-ahead|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2016, COSI announced a partnership between the city of Columbus and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in [[New York City]] to build a $5 million permanent Dinosaur Exhibition Gallery and a dedicated AMNH Traveling Exhibition Gallery replacing the WOSU and Adventure exhibits. The WOSU exhibit has since relocated; however, the Adventure exhibition closed permanently on January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="dispatch.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;$5 million from state budget to bring dinosaur exhibit to COSI]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nbc4i.com/2016/09/21/cosi-will-close-adventure-exhibit-to-make-room-for-natural-history-exhibits/|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;COSI will close ‘Adventure’ exhibit to make room for natural history galleries]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 21, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2016, the COSI board of trustees announced the selection of Dr. Frederic Bertley as COSI Columbus' new president and CEO, effective January 1, 2017. Dr. Bertley was previously senior vice president for science and education at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/10/new-president-and-ceo-of-cosi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2017, the Adventure exhibit permanently closed to make room for COSI's Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">'''Chilled water''' is a commodity often used to cool a building's air and equipment, especially in situations where many individual rooms must be controlled separately, such as a hotel. The chilled water can be supplied by a vendor, such as a [[public utility]] or created at the location of the building that will use it, which has been the norm.

==Use==
Chilled water cooling is not very different from typical residential [[air conditioning]] where [[water]] is pumped from the chiller to the air handler unit to cool the air. 

Regardless of who provides it, the chilled water (between 4° and 7°C (39-44 °F)) is pumped through an [[air handler]], which captures the heat from the air, then disperses the air throughout the area to be cooled.&lt;ref name=HOW&gt;[http://home.howstuffworks.com/ac4.htm How Stuff Works: How Air Conditioners Work-Chilled-water and Cooling-tower AC Units]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-conditioning-and-refrigeration-guide.com/chilled-water-air-conditioning.html Air conditioning and refrigeration guide: Chilled Water Air Conditioning]&lt;/ref&gt;

The condenser water absorbs heat from the refrigerant in the condenser barrel of the water chiller, and is then sent via return lines to a [[cooling tower]], which is a [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]] device used to transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]]. The extent to which the cooling tower decreases the temperature depends upon the outside temperature, the [[relative humidity]] and the [[atmospheric pressure]]. The water in the chilled water circuit will be lowered to the [[Wet-bulb temperature]] or [[dry-bulb temperature]] before proceeding to the [[water chiller]], where it is cooled  to between 4° and 7°C and pumped to the air handler, where the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref name=BIZ /&gt; The equipment required includes chillers, cooling towers, [[pump]]s and electrical control equipment. The initial capital outlay for these is substantial and maintenance costs can fluctuate. Adequate space must be included in building design for the physical plant and access to equipment.

==Utility generated==
The chilled water, having absorbed heat from the air, is sent via return lines back to the utility facility, where the process described in the previous section occurs. Utility generated chilled water eliminates the need for chillers and cooling towers at the property, reduces capital outlays and eliminates ongoing maintenance costs. The physical space saved can also become rentable, increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=BIZ /&gt;  

Utility supplied chilled water has been used successfully since the 1960s in many cities, and technological advances in the equipment, controls and trenchless installation have increased efficiency and lowered costs.&lt;ref name=BIZ /&gt;    

The advantage of utility-supplied chilled water is based on [[economy of scale]]. A utility can operate one large system more economically than a customer can operate the individual system in one building. The utility's system also has back-up capacity to protect against sudden outages. The cost of such "insurance" is also markedly lower than what it would be for an individual structure. 

The use of utility supplied chilled water is most cost effective when it is designed into the building's infrastructure or when chiller/cooling tower equipment must be replaced.  Commercial customers often lower their air conditioning costs from 10-20% by purchasing chilled water.&lt;ref name=BIZ&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/07/14/focus2.html Jacksonville Business Journal: July 11, 2003-JEA's cool idea can save by Chuck Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chilled water storage==

Water can also be chilled at night, where electricity is available at off-peak rates, then stored in a large, insulated tank until needed, the next day, for cooling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">'''Community development planning''' consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of [[town]] or [[neighborhood]] planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, [[Funding|fund]]/[[resource]] identification and direction, planned project [[implementation]]s and re[[evaluation]] of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) [[region]]al, [[city]] and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and [[public activism]]. It often promotes [[public/private partnership]] as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Local Government Planning, 2nd Edition (the "Green Book"). 1979. International City Management Association. Washington, DC. Pages 62 and 553-599.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future [[infrastructure]] and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping [[jurisdiction]]s, levels of [[government]], internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as [[Chamber of commerce|business associations]], [[utilities]] and [[school]]s.

'''Computer-induced health problems''' can be an [[umbrella term]] for the various problems a [[computer]] user can develop from prolonged and incorrect [[computer use]]. A computer user may experience many physical health problems from using computers extensively over a prolonged period of time in an inefficient manner. The computer user may have poor [[etiquette]] when using peripherals, for example incorrect posture. Reportedly, excessive use of electronic screen media can have ill effects on mental health related to mood, cognition, and behavior, even to the point of hallucination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
In today’s world using computers is a necessity for the majority of people but not many people actually consider the medical consequences that working with computers can cause, such as damaged eyesight, bad posture, arthritis in fingers and computer stress injuries that can be caused by sitting in one position for a prolonged period of time. The above problems are more commonly associated with old age but due to many factors such as poor component design, proximity of the user to the screen and an excess of consecutive working hours mean that the above problems can feature in both young and old computer users. This is an extremely important issue as computers become more important in every corner of employment the medical effects caused by them will elevate unless sufficient research is performed and time is dedicated into eliminating and reducing these problems as much as possible. It is estimated that today at least 75% of all jobs involve some level of computer use; this means three-quarters of the workforce are being exposed to numerous health problems, the same can be said of students and educators who do not go through any day without access to a computer for academic work. The figure for people working with and using computers recreationally is to increase considerably in the coming years so it is crucially important that these problems are identified and resolved sooner rather than later in an effort to reduce if not eradicate these problems.

==Common computer-induced medical problems==
Notable physical medical problems that can arise from using computers include Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Computer Vision Syndrome, and Musculoskeletal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/computer-related-injuries|title=Computer-related injuries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carpal Tunnel Syndrome===
The medical problem associated with computer-related work is [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] (CTS). CTS is a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints, especially the wrist, and can lead to numerous musculoskeletal problems. It has become very common among Computer professionals due to poorly placed computer components and extensive typing over a long period of time. Studies conducted show that one in eight computer professionals suffer from CTS.&lt;ref name="Andersen et al 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.289.22.2963 |title=Computer Use and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A 1-Year Follow-up Study |year=2003 |last1=Andersen |first1=J. H. |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=22 |pages=2963–9 |pmid=12799404 |last2=Thomsen |first2=JF |last3=Overgaard |first3=E |last4=Lassen |first4=CF |last5=Brandt |first5=LP |last6=Vilstrup |first6=I |last7=Kryger |first7=AI |last8=Mikkelsen |first8=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was conducted over 21 companies and the majority of sufferers said that they experienced acute and in some cases severe pain due to CTS. The main cause of CTS seems to be debatable, however, with many sources saying that the syndrome is predominantly caused by the acute positioning of the wrist while typing and this problem is exacerbated by the need for the user to be crouching towards the screen while typing. Different research conducted cites the mouse as being the main cause of CTS&lt;ref name="Andersen et al 2003"/&gt; as it was found that among the fingers the right thumb was revealed to be more susceptible to CTS due to the acute position of the thumb while using the mouse. CTS, although prevalent, seems to be very difficult to ameliorate or cure due to the consistency in the design of computer components such as the mouse and the keyboard, but some companies are leading the way with technologies such as touch screen monitors which will reduce stress on the hand and wrist. Employers in major companies are also taking measures to ameliorate CTS by implementing frequent work breaks and work rotation procedures to ensure that employees aren’t working on a single computer for hours on end "a higher level of intensity of computer work results in higher risk for CTS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16984790 |url=http://www.ciop.pl/18291 |year=2006 |last1=Ali |first1=KM |last2=Sathiyasekaran |first2=BW |title=Computer professionals and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=319–25 |journal=International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics |doi=10.1080/10803548.2006.11076691}}&lt;/ref&gt; which causes severe stress on the joints and thus can lead to CTS

Cumulative trauma disorders are caused by "people who sit at PC workstations or visual display terminals in fast-paced, repetitive keystroke jobs. Their fingers, wrists, arms, necks, and back may become so weak and painful that they cannot work,"&lt;ref name="Brien"&gt;O’Brien &amp; Marakas, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;553&lt;/ref&gt; Many people do not think about this when they look at their computer while using it. It is important to note that everything down to the keyboard has a design process behind it focusing on user interface.&lt;ref name="Brien_a"&gt;O’Brien, J. &amp; Marakas, G. (2011).Management Information System, 10e. New York, NY. McGraw-Hill Irwin.{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Vision Syndrome===
In many cases, frequent computer users suffer from computer vision syndrome, which is a degenerative eye problem which can result in severely reduced eyesight (Myopia), blurred vision, overall eye tiredness and even Glaucoma. Computer Eye Syndrome is an umbrella term for many problems but the causes of these problems can be easily identified. When using a computer due to the size and setup of the monitor and components it is necessary for the user to be within at least two feet of the monitor when performing any type of computational work. This presents many problems especially in older monitors due to an elevated amount of monitor glare, poor display quality and insufficient picture display refresh rates. Although these problems are more evident in older computers the newer models are not free from these problems either. Studies have been conducted &lt;ref name="Blehm et al 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.02.008 |title=Computer Vision Syndrome: A Review |year=2005 |last1=Blehm |first1=Clayton |last2=Vishnu |first2=Seema |last3=Khattak |first3=Ashbala |last4=Mitra |first4=Shrabanee |last5=Yee |first5=Richard W. |journal=Survey of Ophthalmology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=253–62 |pmid=15850814}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They state “Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation”&lt;ref name="Blehm et al 2005"/&gt; which shows these problems are quite easily solved with minimal investment from computer manufacturers through producing higher quality monitors with better resolution and refresh rates. The most common form of Computer Vision Syndrome is a condition termed Dry Eye, which results in itchy, sore and even the illusion that something is stuck in your eye. This condition is often caused by extensively long period looking at a computer screen.

Video screens have a design process for user interface. Video screens can cause eyestrain from prolonged viewing. Cathode ray tubes are what are used to display the information on your computer. These send off radiation. This is a concern that has been taken into account when designing better computer screens for user interface.&lt;ref name="Brien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brien_a" /&gt;

===Musculoskeletal problems===
Another medical issue caused by the use of computers is back and posture problems. These problems relate to musculoskeletal disorders caused by the need for the user to be crouched and hunched towards the monitors and computer components due to the design and positioning of these particular computer peripherals. This hunching forward of the user causes posture and back problems but is also the cause of severe and acute pain in the upper back, particularly pain in the neck and or shoulders. A study &lt;ref name="Andersen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.2007.033506 |title=Computer mouse use predicts acute pain but not prolonged or chronic pain in the neck and shoulder |year=2008 |last1=Andersen |first1=J H |last2=Harhoff |first2=M |last3=Grimstrup |first3=S |last4=Vilstrup |first4=I |last5=Lassen |first5=C F |last6=Brandt |first6=L P A |last7=Kryger |first7=A I |last8=Overgaard |first8=E |last9=Hansen |first9=K D |last10=Mikkelsen |first10=S |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |pmid=17681996|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted where 2146 technical assistants installed a computer program to monitor the musculoskeletal pain they suffered and answered questionnaires on the location and severity of the pain. The study showed interesting results, as it detailed how in the majority of cases any pain suffered was aggravated and exacerbated by the use of computer peripherals like the mouse and keyboard but overall the pain did not originate from using computers. "Moreover, there seems to be no relationship between computer use and prolonged and chronic neck and shoulder pain"&lt;ref name="Andersen et al 2008"/&gt; This is a positive study for computer manufacturers but although the pain may not originate from computer peripherals there is no doubt that the pain is exacerbated by their use and this revelation alone should lead computer manufacturers to pioneer new technologies that reduce the risk of posture or musculoskeletal problems aggravated by the use of poorly designed and linearly designed computer peripherals.

In another study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wahlstro¨m|first=Jens|title=Ergonomics, musculoskeletal disorders and computer work|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/3/168.full.pdf?origin=publication_detail|work=oxfordjournals.org|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that women are at a greater risk than men to suffer from musculoskeletal problems than men. Two explanations given were that "women appear to consistently report more neck and upper extremity symptoms than men.", and that women may assume more taxing positions while working than men do due to differences in anthropometrics.

=== Sleep disorders ===
A study with 4100 young adults revealed that intensive use of cell phones and computers can be linked to an increase in [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep disorders]] and [[Depression (mood)|depressive symptoms]] in young adults. It’s been shown that the light from TV and computer screens affects melatonin production and melanopsin stimulation, and throws off our [[Circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]]. This interrupts or prevents deep, restorative sleep, causing an increase in stress and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-volpi-md-pc-facs/technology-depression_b_1723625.html|title=Heavy Technology Use Linked to Fatigue, Stress and Depression in Young Adults|last=F.A.C.S|first=David Volpi, M. D. , P. C.|date=2012-08-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental problems===

Public Health England said children who spend too long on the internet face social problems such as loneliness, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10835157/Too-much-time-on-web-gives-children-mental-health-problems.html|title=Too much time on web 'gives children mental health problems'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr Victoria Dunkley, excessive use of electronic screen media can have ill effects on mental health related to mood, cognition, and behavior -- and may even result in psychosis in the form of hallucination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mental-wealth/201207/electronic-screen-syndrome-unrecognized-disorder|title=Electronic Screen Syndrome: An Unrecognized Disorder? Screentime and the rise of mental disorders in children.|date=Jul 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She calls this "Electronic Screen Syndrome" (ESS). She claims the root of these symptoms appears to be linked to repeated stress on the nervous system, making self-regulation and stress management less efficient. She says interacting with screens shifts the nervous system into fight-or-flight mode which leads to dysregulation as an inability to modulate one’s mood, attention, or level of arousal in a manner appropriate to one’s environment.

==Possible ameliorations==
Overall it is clear to see that there are many medical problems that can arise from using computers and damaged eyesight, CTS and musculoskeletal problems are only the tip of the iceberg. But it is also important to note that changes are currently being made to ensure that all these problems are ameliorated to the best standard that employers and computer users currently have the technology to implement. By taking measures like ensuring our computer peripherals are situated to ensure maximum comfort while working and taking frequent breaks from computational work can go a long way to ensuring that many medical conditions arising from computers are avoided. These are small measures but they go a long way to ensuring that computer users maintain their health, As with many modern and marvellous technologies in the world today there is always a downside and the major downside of computers is the medical problems that can arise from their prolonged use. Thus it is the duty of computer users and employers everywhere to ensure that the downside is kept to a minimum.

In addition to the actual design of computer work, other job conditions can contribute to the stress of operators. These include low wages, absence of career advancement opportunities and inadequate child care.

==Treatment==
Modern medical treatment for computer-induced medical problems like carpal tunnel syndrome include splints, surgery, corticosteroids, and physiotherapy therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199903)35:3&lt;232::AID-AJIM3&gt;3.0.CO;2-G |title=Clinical management of carpal tunnel syndrome: A 12-year review of outcomes |year=1999 |last1=Feuerstein |first1=Michael |last2=Burrell |first2=Lolita M. |last3=Miller |first3=Virginia I. |last4=Lincoln |first4=Andrew |last5=Huang |first5=Grant D. |last6=Berger |first6=Ruth |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=232–45 |pmid=9987556}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternative medicine for computer-induced medical problems has also been shown to be effective, notably acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23248650 |year=2012 |last1=Khosrawi |first1=Saeid |last2=Moghtaderi |first2=Alireza |last3=Haghighat |first3=Shila |title=Acupuncture in treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome: A randomized controlled trial study |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |pmc=3523426 |journal=Journal of Research in Medical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation-restoration of the ''[[H.L. Hunley]]''''' is currently being undertaken by the [[Warren Lasch Conservation Center]]; they hope to have the ''Hunley'' project completed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L. Hunley|url=http://thetandd.com/news/a-fresh-look-at-the-h-l-hunley/article_0e9e261e-8736-11e6-a3aa-3fdd6b2bc384.html|website=T&amp;D|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Hunley'' was located in 1995 and recovered from the ocean in 2000, a team of conservators from the Lasch Conservation Center has been working to restore the ''Hunley''. 

The ''Hunley'', the first combat submarine to successfully complete its mission, has been at the Lasch Conservation Center for over 15 years while scientist and conservators formulate a plan for its restoration. Once the ''Hunley''{{’}}s conservation and restoration is complete it will be relocated to a new museum built in its honor on the former Navy base in North Charleston. Currently visitors can tour the conservation center laboratories and can view the ''Hunley'' in its 75,000-gallon tank.

==History and sinking of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
{{main article|Sinking of USS Housatonic}}
''H.L. Hunley'' is a civil war confederate submarine built in 1863 by Park &amp; Lyons; Hunley, McClintock &amp; Weston. Its length is 39.5 ft. and its beam is 3.83 ft. and it had a speed of four [[Knot (unit)|knots]]. It was propelled by a hand cranked propeller and held a crew of one officer and seven enlisted men. Its armament carried one spar torpedo. The ''Hunley'' sank three times during its short career. The first two times were during test runs, and the final time was during its attack of the {{USS|Housatonic|1861}}. The ''Hunley'' was lost to the Charleston outer harbor until 1995 and was finally recovered in 2000.

On February 17, 1864, the ''Hunley'' destroyed the Union sloop ''Housatonic'' outside the Charleston Harbor. The ''Hunley'' was too close to the ''Housatonic'' when they exploded the torpedo. The Hunley was mounted with a “spar-mounted torpedo loaded with 135 pounds of gunpowder”. After the ''Hunley'' had rammed the ''Housatonic'' and embedded the torpedo in her hull, the ''Hunley'' reversed course while the lanyard connected to the torpedo fuse was tightened and exploded. The ''Housatonic'' sank immediately; however, the ''Hunley'' did not sink so quickly. Evidence shows that the ''Hunley'' may have survived up to an hour after the detonation of the torpedo on the ''Housatonic''.

==Discovery and recovery of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Location of the Hunley.png|thumb|Location of the ''Hunley'' submarine]]
The ''H.L. Hunley'' was found in 1995 in the Charleston outer harbor about four miles off Sullivan’s island. The divers had to dive down 30 feet of water before finding the ''Hunley'', which was buried in the sand and sediment. There is some controversy about who located the actual position of the ''Hunley''. Well-known author [[Clive Cussler]] and underwater archaeologist [[E. Lee Spence]] both claim to have made the original discovery. Cussler claims to have discovered it in 1995, and Spence says he discovered it in 1970 but failed to validate the discovery by diving in the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Confederate Submarine H.L. Hunley|url=http://shipwrecks.com/hunley_discovery/|website=Shipwrecks|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSSHLHunleyrecovery.jpg|thumb|''H.L. Hunley'' recovery]]
The ''Hunley'' was sent to Lasch Conservation Center at the old Charleston Navy Yard for conservation. The remains of the eight crewmen serving on the ''Hunley'' when it sank were found and buried on April 17, 2004, at the [[Magnolia Cemetery (Charleston, South Carolina)|Magnolia Cemetery]] in Charleston. The recovery and conservation of the ''H.L. Hunley'' was championed by South Carolina Senator [[Glenn F. McConnell|Glenn McConnell]]. He asked Warren Lasch to take on the fundraising and oversee the conservation and restoration treatment of the ''Hunley''. Lasch accepted the challenge in 1997 and became the chairman of the Friends of the Hunley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search and Recovery|url=https://hunley.org/the-search-and-recovery/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of deterioration present on the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Rust on iron.jpg|thumb|Rust on iron]]

===Rust===
[[Rust]] occurs naturally when iron or steel is submerged in water and exposed to oxygen. It can also occur when the moisture content of the air surrounding the metal is high. Because the ''H.L. Hunley'' was made of iron and was submerged for over a hundred years, rust had formed all over the submarine. However, to prevent more rust from forming, the conservators choose to keep the ''H.L. Hunley'' submerged in a water tank, instead of exposing it to the oxygen-rich air, until a full conservation plan could be created.

===Metal Fatigue===
[[Fatigue (material)|Metal Fatigue (Stress and Corrosion)]] can be either from stress or corrosion. Stress fatigue occurs when the metal is repeatedly pushed back and forth, such as from water pressure. This pressure eventually cause tiny cracks to form in the metal. Corrosion fatigue happens when the cracks in the metal becomes corrosive and weaken the structure. Thus normal wear and tear can cause metal fatigue.

===Causes of deterioration===

[[File:Hunley 001.jpg|thumb|''Hunley'']]

====Salt Water====
The combination of salt water and metal can cause several types of [[corrosion]], electrochemical corrosion and anaerobic corrosion. Electrochemical corrosion happens because the metal ions attract other compounds, which then cause the salt in the water to attack the metal. Anaerobic corrosion occurs when sulfate deposits surround the submerged metal and start producing hydrogen sulfide, which corrodes metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Bailey|title=The Effects of Saltwater on Metals|url=http://sciencing.com/effects-saltwater-metals-8632636.html|website=Sciencing|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''H.L. Hunley'' sank in the outer harbor of Charleston, the salt water had over a hundred years to eat through the metal.

====Air/oxygen====
Iron artifacts from the sea in particular are susceptible to rapid deterioration when exposed to an oxygen-rich environment like air. Chlorides from the seawater penetrate the iron on the molecular level. When in solution, these chlorides present no real problem. However, when exposed to air, they slowly dry in crystal form. As the crystals grow, the surface of the metal will expand and flake away, eventually reducing the artifact to a pile of iron oxide dust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation|url=https://hunley.org/conservation/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the iron oxide dust is called rust. Rust occurs naturally on iron when it has been submerged for a while and is exposed to oxygen.

====Concretion====
Concretion is an encrusted layer of sand, sediment and shells that builds up slowly, when an object is submerged in water. Over time, marine organisms colonize on the submerged metal and build up layers of calcium. These layers create a barrier for a micro environment on the surface of the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron corrosion &amp; Concretion formation|url=http://www.clihouston.com/news/iron-corrosion-concretion-formation.html|website=CLI Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments of deterioration==
===Timeline of conservation and restoration===
* August 2000: ''Hunley'' raised from the sea
* February 2001: Several hull plates are removed
* March 2001: First artifacts are found
* April 2001: First human remains are uncovered
* September 2001: Second Phase of conservation and restoration begins
* January 2002: Third Phase begins, studies on the human remains and excavation of the block lifts
* 2003: Fourth Phase begins, excavation of the ballast tanks
* 2008: 3-D scanning of the exterior surface
* June 2011:  ''Hunley'' is rotated to an upright position
* May 2014: ''Hunley'' is lowered into the 75,000 gallon tank, designed to remove the salt from the metal
* 2014-2015: Removal of the outer concretion
* 2016: Removal of the interior concretion

===Rotation===
The ''Hunley'' was removed from its watery grave at a 45-degree angle in order to keep the interior contents from shifting and falling through a weaken section of the hull. The ''Hunley'' had been lying at 45-degree angle on the sea floor for more than a hundred years. To lift the civil war submarine from the ocean, several slings were attached to the underside of the submarine and then slowly lifted from the water. 

Once the submarine was relocated to the Lasch Conservation Center, it was left in the slings at a 45-degree angle until the hull plates and keel blocks were removed, eleven tons of sediment had been cleaned out of the interior and a engineering and strength evaluation could be completed. Once the evaluation was completed and the ''Hunley'' was deemed safe to move, it took three days in June of 2011 to turn the civil war submarine upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Brian|title=Righting the Hunley: Sub's move begins Wednesday, with rotation next week|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/righting-the-hunley-sub-s-move-begins-wednesday-with-rotation/article_ba49de16-4a52-589c-8d31-55cfcb2d1037.html|website=The Post and Courier|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservators also used sensors, located on the keel support, to monitor the weight on each bearing. This was done so that the conservators can make sure the weight of the submarine is being supported evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley hull being revealed after almost 150 years|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700145372/Confederate-submarine-HL-Hunley-hull-being-revealed-after-almost-150-years.html|website=Associated Press|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concretion removal===
When the ''Hunley'' was brought to the Lasch Conservation Center, it had over 1,200 pounds of concretion on its outer hull, that is equal to the weight of a large grizzly bear. In some places on the hull the concretion was over an inch thick. To remove the concretion, conservators spent many hours slowly chiseling the concretion off, using pneumatic chisels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L. Hunley|url=http://thetandd.com/news/a-fresh-look-at-the-h-l-hunley/article_0e9e261e-8736-11e6-a3aa-3fdd6b2bc384.html|website=T&amp;D|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took conservators over a year to remove all the concretion from the outer hull. Currently the conservators have finished removing the concretion from the outside and are working on the interior. It will take at least another year to remove the interior concretion, perhaps a little longer since the conservators have to work in the small interior space of the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hull of Confederate sub H.L.

===Submersion===
After the ''Hunley'' was recovered  it was placed in a 75,000-gallon tank. This was in order to protect the ''Hunley'' from the deterioration properties of oxygen. If it was left out in the open air, it would immediately begin to rust and deteriorate rapidly. By placing the ''Hunley'' in the tank, consisting of water and a solution of [[sodium hydroxide]], conservators had bought some time to formulate a conservation plan. "During treatment, the ''Hunley'' will be constantly monitored and once the chemical bath is saturated with the salts it has leached from the submarine, it will be drained from the tank, neutralized, and replaced with a fresh solution.  This process, which is estimated to take approximately 5-7 years, will be repeated until the level of salt in the iron is low enough to allow the ''Hunley'' to be rescued from its delicate and dangerous state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conservation |date=n.d. |access-date=March 20, 2017 |url=https://hunley.org/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">The '''Dana/Spicer Model 50''' was an automotive axle manufactured by the [[Dana Holding Corporation]] for 25 years and was used solely in OEM [[Ford]] applications. Dana 50's were made as front axles only. The Dana 50 has a "50" cast in to the housing and is regarded to have more strength than a [[Dana 44]], but not as much as a [[Dana 60]]. It was only produced in a reverse cut gear set aka a high pinion.

The Dana 50 was made as a solid axle and as a [[Twin Traction Beam]] (TTB) which pivots in the center allowing the wheels to move independently of each other. A unique quality of the Dana 50 axle is the lack of variation in both TTB and Solid axle versions, which simplifies repairs and upgrades. There were no carrier breaks and only one spline count (30 spline). Gross axle weight ratings were lowered by Ford for safety and tire reasons.

[[File:Dana50TTB.jpg|thumb|Dana 50 TTB from a 1996 F-250]]

__TOC__

==General Specifications==
* Ring gear measures 9.0".
* 30 Spline Axle shafts.
* Gear Ratios: 3.54:1 - 5.38:1
* No carrier breaks
* Pinion shaft diameter: 1.375"
* Pinion shaft splines: 26
* Axle shaft diameter: 1.50"
* Axle spline diameter: 1.31"

==Twin Traction Beam==
The Twin Traction Beam or TTB was used in the Ford F-250 from 1980 to 1997. The TTB Dana 50 was also used selectively in the F-350 from 1980 to 1986. The [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVW]] was lower in a F-350 with a TTB Dana 50, than a F-350 with a solid axle. The [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] of a TTB Dana 50 was 4600&amp;nbsp;lbs.

*The Dana 50 TTB spindles will accept the Dana 60 hubs however the knuckles ''are not'' interchangeable. 
*All Dana 50 TTB axles were leaf sprung axles.

==Solid Axle==
The solid axle Dana 50 was used in the Ford F-250 and the F-350 from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivetrainshop.com/Dana_50_s/88.htm|title=Dana 50 specs|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This axle was also the only OEM axle used in [[Four-wheel drive]] [[Ford Excursion]]s. The GAWR of a solid axle Dana 50 is 5000&amp;nbsp;lbs.

{{Emotion}}
'''Empathy''' is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | title=The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine | author1=Bellet, Paul S. | author2=Michael J.

Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006). ''Help for the Helper: The psychophysiology of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

== Definitions ==

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J. (2001). Regulating the costs of empathy: the price of being human. ''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empathy/ |title=Empathy |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

* '''Fantasy''': the tendency to identify with fictional characters.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===
By the age of two years, children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, M.L. (2000). ''Empathy and Moral Development''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy, in the sense that they understand that, just like their own actions, other people's actions have goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Meyer M. | year = 2008 | title = From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1053–1080 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000503 | pmid = 18838031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinrad, T.L., &amp; Sadovsky, A.

''Nature Neuroscience'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[toddler]]s will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two. Also during the second year, toddlers will play games of falsehood or "pretend" in an effort to fool others, and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zahn-Waxler C. |author2=Radke-Yarrow M. | year = 1990 | title = The origins of empathic concern | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 107–130 | doi = 10.1007/BF00991639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to develop these traits, it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a [[sedentary lifestyle]].

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise. Retrieved July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims? Assessment of Trait and Situational Predictors|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=August 8, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=245–267|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x/asset/asap1262.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvu9nj&amp;s=2892713f7a99d42574ccda68fa2bbfc1c1578249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einolf|first=Christopher|title=Is Cognitive Empathy More Important than Affective Empathy? A Response to "Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?"|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=March 13, 2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=268–271|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x/asset/asap1281.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvq647&amp;s=df598d6cfad7025a88420f2f5c207c0c980672fa|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

=== Gender differences ===
The literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the [[Systemizing Quotient]] (SQ). Both males and females with [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum disorders]] usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ ([[#Autism|see below]] for more detail on autism and empathy).&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; However, a series of studies, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Tzeng O.J. |author3=Decety J. |author4=Hsieh J.C. | year = 2006 | title = Gender differences in the human mirror system: a magnetoencephalography study | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 1115–1119 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000223393.59328.21 | pmid=16837838}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinal reflex excitability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Hsieh J.C. |author4=Hung D. |author5=Tzeng O.J. | year = 2007 | title = Gender differences in spinal excitability during observation of bipedal locomotion | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 887–890 | doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e3280ebb486 | pmid=17515795}}&lt;/ref&gt; electroencephalography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang C.Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Lee S. |author4=Chen G. |author5=Cheng Y. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in the Mu rhythm during empathy for pain: An electroencephalographic study | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1251 | issue = | pages = 176–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.11.062 | pmid = 19083993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheng Y., Lee P., Yang C.Y., Lin C.P., Decety J. | year = 2008 | title = Gender differences in the mu rhythm of the human mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e2113 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2113C | last2 = Lee | last3 = Yang | last4 = Lin | last5 = Hung | last6 = Decety | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002113 | editor1-last = Rustichini | editor1-first = Aldo | pmid=18461176 | pmc=2361218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and N400 paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When neurons do not mirror the agent's intentions: Sex differences in neural coding of goal-directed actions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent's_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|journal = Neuropsychologia|pages = 1454–1463|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.01.015|first = Alice Mado|last = Proverbio|first2 = Federica|last2 = Riva|first3 = Alberto|last3 = Zani|year = 2010|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908202105/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent%27s_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|archivedate = September 8, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the presence of an overall gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants tending to exhibit stronger motor resonance than male participants.

Using [[fMRI]], neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD |date=Jan 2006 | title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7075| pages = 466–9 | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Stephan | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1038/nature04271 | pmid = 16421576 | pmc = 2636868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis from the journal of ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that, overall, there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females, on average, were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid = 25236781|pmc = 5110041|year = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814055810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|archivedate = August 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H.

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies. In fact, more than 50% of people who suffer from a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sousa|first=Arielle|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Li|first4=Sophie|last5=Dimoska|first5=Aneta|last6=James|first6=Charlotte|date=2010-10-01|title=Why don't you feel how I feel?

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C. D. |author2=Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc.

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing. It is possible to see this form of anger as a [[pro-social]] emotion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

Atypical empathic responses have been associated with [[autism spectrum|autism]] and particular [[personality disorders]] such as [[psychopathy]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]],  [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] personality disorders; [[conduct disorder]];&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008" /&gt; [[schizophrenia]]; [[bipolar disorder]];&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; and [[depersonalization]].&lt;ref name="Grossman 1996"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grossman |first=Dave |title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society |publisher=Back Bay Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-316-33000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of affective empathy has also been associated with sex offenders. It was found that offenders that had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured the same type of abuse, felt less affective empathy for their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Dominique|last2=Wurtele|first2=Sandy K.|last3=Heil|first3=Peggy|date=2002-12-01|title=Childhood Victimization and Lack of Empathy as Predictors of Sexual Offending Against Women and Children|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/17/12/1291|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1291–1307|doi=10.1177/088626002237857|issn=0886-2605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

A study of [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]] adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of [[alexithymia]],&lt;ref name="Hill et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hill E. |author2=Berthoz S. |author3=Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives. |url=http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619122446/http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others.&lt;ref name="Hill et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.J. and Bagby, R.M &amp; Parker, J.D.A.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]].

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions.

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile.

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===

Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.&lt;ref name="Cleckly, 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

One diagnostic criterion of [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR npd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120212711/http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder |date=January 20, 2013 }} – [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of [[schizoid personality disorder]] include emotional coldness, detachment, and impaired [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] corresponding with an inability to be empathetic and sensitive towards others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR spd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder Schizoid personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115182207/http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder |date=November 15, 2012 }}, ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guntrip"&gt;Guntrip, Harry.

A study conducted by [[Jean Decety]] and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]] demonstrated that subjects with aggressive [[conduct disorder]] elicit atypical empathic responses to viewing others in pain.&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety, J. |author2=Michalska, K.J. |author3=Akitsuki, Y. |author4= Lahey, B. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=Atypical empathic responses in adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder: a functional MRI investigation |journal=Biological Psychology |pmid=18940230|volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=203–11 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.09.004 |pmc=2819310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as [[Scientific control|controls]] to the pain of others but, unlike controls, subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the [[amygdala]] and [[ventral striatum]] (areas that enable a general arousing effect of [[Reward system|reward]]), yet impaired activation of the [[Biological neural network|neural]] regions involved in self-regulation and [[metacognition]] (including [[moral reasoning]]), in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008" /&gt;

[[Schizophrenia]] is characterized by impaired affective empathy,&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the Empathy Quotient (EQ).&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"/&gt; These empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017" /&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], in his book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society|On Killing]]'', suggests that military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers, suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other human beings.&lt;ref name="Grossman 1996"/&gt;

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared: with pain, and empathic pain. If they supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy.&lt;ref name="HeinSilani2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hein|first1=Grit|last2=Silani|first2=Giorgia|last3=Preuschoff|first3=Kerstin|last4=Batson|first4=C.

He ascertains empathy as an exhaustive process that limits us in morality and if low empathy makes for bad people, bundled up in that unsavoury group would be many who have Asperger’s or autism and reveals his own brother is severely autistic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
Early indicators for a lack of empathy:
#Frequently finding oneself in prolonged arguments
#Forming opinions early and defending them vigorously
#Thinking that other people are overly sensitive
#Refusing to listen to other points of view
#Blaming others for mistakes
#Not listening when spoken to
#Holding grudges and having difficulty to forgive
#Inability to work in a team{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

The '''European Centre for Minority Issues''' ('''ECMI''') is a [[research institute]] based in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], that conducts research into [[Minority group|minority]]-majority relations in [[Europe]]. ECMI is a non-partisan and interdisciplinary institution. It is a non-profit, independent foundation, registered according to German Civil Law.

[[File:ECMI logo 250x69.gif|thumb|ECMI Logo]]

ECMI was established in 1996 by the governments of [[Denmark]], Germany and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/3/in+english/|title=About|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is governed by a board composed of nine members: three from Denmark, three from Germany, one representative from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], one from the [[Council of Europe]] and one from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; The institute's first director was Stefan Troebst, now Professor of East European Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Starting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/76/2006/12/07/Starting-ECMI.php|title=Starting ECMI|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Tove H. Malloy.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/17/ecmi+staff/|title=ECMI staff|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre employs a core staff and also hosts visiting [[fellow]]s and visiting research associates.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;
The Centre organizes its activities around three principal themes. It is concerned with the evaluation and further development of universal, regional, bilateral and national standards that may assist in consolidating democratic governance on the basis of ethnic diversity and human rights. In this context, ECMI is also particularly interested in the emerging convergence of standards between EU members and applicant states. A second area of involvement relates to implementation procedures and mechanisms for these diverse standards and the study of their effectiveness. At times, ECMI has been invited to consider standards implementation and majority-minority relations in particular states in cooperation with the government of that state and local groups.

==Publications==

Over the years,the European Centre for Minority Issues has produced a number of Monographs, Reports, Working Papers and Issue Briefs,as well as the peer reviewed online [[open access journal]], Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues  in Europe (JEMIE), in addition to co-editorship (with [[European_Academy_of_Bozen|EURAC Bozen]]) of the flagship publication European Yearbook of Minority Issues. The goal of this publication effort is to increase the awareness and dissemination of topics on minority issues, as well as to encourage further research in this field.

{{about|the biological process||Exfoliation (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Acer griseum2.jpg|thumb|The exfoliating bark of the [[Paperbark Maple]] ''Acer griseum'']]

'''Exfoliation''' (from the term "foliate", meaning “related to [[leaf|leaves]]”) means the removal or loss of leaves from a [[plant]].  It is used both to describe the loss of a leaves as a natural part of a plant’s [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] (such as in the case of [[deciduous trees]] which lose their leaves in the autumn) or because of some trauma or outside cause (such as [[dehydration]], an [[infestation]] of [[caterpillar]]s or [[hurricane]]-force winds).

In [[arboriculture]], the term “exfoliating [[Bark (botany)|bark]]” describes the natural process and condition of the bark peeling-away from a [[tree trunk]], typically in large pieces that remain partially attached to the trunk until such time as they are completely detached by the elements or the eventual and subsequent exfoliation of additional layers of bark.  Examples of trees with exfoliating bark are the [[paperbark maple]] and various species of [[Platanus|Plane]] (Sycamore) and [[birch]].

In a conventional [[finite state machine]], the transition is associated with a set of input [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an '''extended finite state machine (EFSM) model''', the transition can be expressed by an “[[if statement]]” consisting of a set of [[trigger condition]]s. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified [[data operation]]s.

* T is a transition relation, &lt;math&gt;T : S \times F \times I \rightarrow S \times U \times O&lt;/math&gt;

==Structure==

EFSM Architecture: An EFSM model consists of the following three major combinational blocks (and a few registers).

* FSM-block: A conventional finite state machine realizing the state transition graphs of the EFSM model.
* A-block: an arithmetic block for performing the data operation associated with each transition. The operation of this block is regulated by the output signals of the FSM block.
* E-block: A block for evaluating the trigger conditions associated with each transition. The input signals to this block are the data variables, while the output is a set of [[binary numeral system|binary]] signals taken for input by the FSM-block. Information about redundant computation is extracted by analyzing the interactions among the three basic blocks. Using this information, certain input operands of the [[arithmetic]] block and [[evaluation]] block can be frozen through input gating under specific run time conditions to reduce the unnecessary switching in the design. At the architecture level, if each trigger evaluation &amp; data operation is regarded as an atomic action, then the EFSM implies an almost lowest-power implementation.

The cycle behavior of an EFSM can be divided into three steps: 
# In E-block, evaluate all trigger conditions.
# In FSM-block, compute the next state &amp; the signals controlling A-block.
# In A-block, perform the necessary data operations and data movements.

'''G-force induced loss of consciousness''' (abbreviated as '''G-LOC''', pronounced 'JEE-lock') is a term generally used in [[aerospace physiology]] to describe a [[Syncope (medicine)|loss of consciousness]] occurring from excessive and sustained [[g-force]]s draining blood away from the brain causing cerebral [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  The condition is most likely to affect [[aviator|pilots]] of high performance [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] aircraft or [[astronaut]]s but is possible on some [[g-force#Human g-force experience|extreme amusement park rides]].  G-LOC incidents have caused fatal accidents in high performance aircraft capable of sustaining high ''g'' for extended periods.  [[High-G training]] for pilots of high performance aircraft or spacecraft often includes ground training for G-LOC in special [[centrifuge#Aeronautics and astronautics|centrifuges]], with some profiles exposing pilots to 9 ''g''s for a sustained period.

==Effects of ''g''-forces==
[[File:Gforce demo2.webm|alt=A simulation of the effects of g-forces on humans. As time progresses, tunnel vision occurs and nearly progresses to complete blackout.|thumb|A simulation of the effects of g-forces on humans. As time progresses, tunnel vision occurs and nearly progresses to complete blackout.]]
Under increasing positive ''g''-force, blood in the body will tend to move from the head toward the feet. For higher intensity or longer duration, this can manifest progressively as:

* [[Greyout (medical)|Greyout]] - a loss of color vision
* [[Tunnel vision]] - loss of peripheral vision, retaining only the center vision
* Blackout - a complete loss of vision  but retaining consciousness.
* G-LOC - where consciousness is lost.

Under negative ''g'', blood pressure will increase in the head, running the risk of the dangerous condition known as [[redout]], with too much blood pressure in the head and eyes.

Because of the high level of sensitivity that the eye’s retina has to hypoxia, symptoms are usually first experienced visually. As the retinal blood pressure decreases below [[Intraocular pressure|globe pressure]] (usually 10–21&amp;nbsp;mm Hg), blood flow begins to cease to the retina, first affecting perfusion farthest from the optic disc and retinal artery with progression towards central vision.  Skilled pilots can use this loss of vision as their indicator that they are at maximum turn performance without losing consciousness. Recovery is usually prompt following removal of ''g''-force but a period of several seconds of disorientation may occur.  Absolute incapacitation is the period of time when the aircrew member is physically unconscious and averages about 12 seconds. Relative incapacitation is the period in which the consciousness has been regained, but the person is confused and remains unable to perform simple tasks. This period averages about 15 seconds. Upon regaining cerebral blood flow, the G-LOC victim usually experiences myoclonic convulsions (often called the ‘funky chicken’) and often full amnesia of the event is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;http://goflightmedicine.com/pulling-gs/&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief but vivid dreams have been reported to follow G-LOC. If G-LOC occurs at low altitude, this momentary lapse can [[Controlled flight into terrain|prove fatal]] and even highly experienced pilots can pull straight to a G-LOC condition without first perceiving the visual onset warnings that would normally be used as the sign to back off from pulling any more ''g''s.

The human body is much more tolerant of ''g''-force when it is applied [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|laterally]] (across the body) than when applied [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|longitudinally]] (along the length of the body).  Unfortunately most sustained ''g''-forces incurred by pilots is applied longitudinally. This has led to experimentation with [[Gloster Meteor F8 "Prone Pilot"|prone pilot]] aircraft designs which lies the pilot face down or (more successfully) reclined positions for astronauts.

==Thresholds==

The ''g'' thresholds at which these effects occur depend on the training, age and fitness of the individual.  An un-trained individual not used to the ''G''-straining manoeuvre can black out between 4 and 6 ''g'', particularly if this is pulled suddenly.  A trained, fit individual wearing a ''g'' suit and practicing the straining manoeuvre can, with some difficulty, sustain up to 9''g'' without loss of consciousness.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

{{Music of Indonesia}}
 
'''Gamelan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|m|ə|l|æ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C. Wells|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|publisher=Pearson Longman|edition=3rd|date=April 3, 2008|isbn=1405881186}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[traditional music|traditional]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] music of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] in [[Indonesia]], made up predominantly of [[percussion instrument|percussive instruments]]. The most common instruments used are [[metallophone]]s played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called ''[[kendhang]]'' which register the [[beat (music)|beat]]. Other instruments include [[xylophone]]s, [[bamboo flute]]s, a [[string instrument|bowed instrument]] called a ''[[rebab]]'', and even vocalists called ''[[sindhen]]''.&lt;!--Instruments are built and tuned to stay together&amp;nbsp;– as a result, instruments from different gamelans are generally not interchangeable.--&gt;&lt;ref name=sumarsam&gt;Sumarsam (1998). [http://sumarsam.web.wesleyan.edu/Intro.gamelan.pdf ''Introduction to Javanese Gamelan'']. Middletown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the popularity of gamelan has declined since the introduction of pop music, gamelan is still commonly played on formal occasions and in many traditional Indonesian ceremonies. For most Indonesians, gamelan is an integral part of [[Indonesian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bramantyo Prijosusilo, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 Indonesia needs the Harmony of the Gamelan'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115102945/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 |date=2013-01-15 }}, ''The Jakarta Globe'', 22 February 2011. {{verification needed|date=June 2014|reason=Article states that gamelan "once was so much a part of community life" that each village had a set, but at most refers to its relative loss of importance today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word '''''gamelan''''' comes from the [[Javanese language#Registers|low Javanese]] word ''gamel'', which may refer to a type of mallet used to strike instruments or the act of striking with a mallet.&lt;ref name=sumarsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). ''Javanese Gamelan'', p.10. {{ISBN|0-19-588582-1}}.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''karawitan''''' refers to classical gamelan music and performance practice, and comes from the word ''rawit'', meaning 'intricate' or 'finely worked'.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; The word derives from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word of [[Sanskrit]] origin, ''rawit'', which refers to the sense of smoothness and elegance idealized in Javanese music. Another word from this root, ''pangrawit'', means a person with such sense, and is used as an honorific when discussing esteemed gamelan musicians. The high Javanese word for ''gamelan'' is '''''gangsa''''', formed either from the words ''tembaga'' and ''rejasa'' referring to the materials used in bronze gamelan construction (copper and tin), or ''tiga'' and ''sedasa'' referring to their proportions (three and ten).&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay (1992), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Musician Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Musicians performing musical ensemble, bas-relief of [[Borobudur]]]]
[[File:Gong and Chime Culture Map.jpg|thumb|right|The three major indigenous genres of gong-chime music prevalent in Southeast Asia: this includes the ''gamelan'' of western Indonesia; the ''[[kulintang]]'' of the southern Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Malaysia; and the ''[[piphat]]'' of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Burma]]
&lt;!--[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60015940.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Gamelan orchestra (1870-1891)]]--&gt;
The gamelan predates the [[Indianized kingdoms|Hindu-Buddhist culture]] that dominated Indonesia in its earliest records and thus represents an indigenous art form. In contrast to the heavy [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] influence in other art forms, the only obvious [[Music of India|Indian influence]] in gamelan music is in the Javanese style of singing, and in the themes of the [[Wayang kulit]] (shadow puppet plays).&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Javanese mythology, the gamelan was created by Sang Hyang Guru in [[Saka era]] 167 (c. AD 230), the god who ruled as king of all Java from a palace on the Maendra mountain in [[Medang Kamulan]] (now [[Mount Lawu]]). He needed a signal to summon the gods and thus invented the gong. For more complex messages, he invented two other gongs, thus forming the original gamelan set.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Warsodiningrat, ''Serat Weda Pradangga''. Cited in Roth, A. R. ''New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan''. University of Durham, Doctoral Thesis, 1986. Page 4.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest image of a musical ensemble is found on the bas-relief of 8th century Buddhist monument of [[Borobudur]], Central Java.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borobudur's musicians play [[lute]]-like stringed instruments, ''[[kendang]]'' drums, ''[[suling]]'' flutes, small [[cymbal]]s and bells. Some of these musical instruments are indeed included in a complete gamelan orchestra. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, and bowed and plucked string instruments were identified in this image. However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.

The instruments developed into their current form during the [[Majapahit Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, ''Bulletin for National Museum of Canada'' (Ottawa: April 1961), p.2, cited in Donald A. Lentz. ''The Gamelan Music of Java and Bali: An Artistic Anomaly Complementary to Primary Tonal Theoretical Systems''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965. Page 5.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inscriptions and manuscripts dated from the Majapahit period, the kingdom even had a government office in charge of supervising the performing arts, including the gamelan. The arts office oversaw the construction of musical instruments, as well as scheduling performances at the court.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"/&gt;

In the palaces of [[Java]] the oldest known ensembles, Gamelan ''[[Munggang]]'' and ''Gamelan Kodok Ngorek'', are apparently from the 12th century. These formed the basis of a "loud style" of music. In contrast, a "soft style" developed out of the ''[[kemanak]]'' tradition and is related to the traditions of singing [[Javanese poetry]], in a manner  often believed to be similar to the chorus that accompanies the modern ''[[bedhaya]]'' dance. In the 17th century, these loud and soft styles mixed, and to a large extent the variety of modern gamelan styles of Bali, Java, and Sunda resulted from different ways of mixing these elements. Thus, despite the seeming diversity of styles, many of the same theoretical concepts, instruments, and techniques are shared between the styles.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
A gamelan is a multi-timbre ensemble consisting of metallophones, xylophones, flutes, gongs, voices, as well as bowed and plucked strings. The hand-played drum called ''kendhang''  controls the tempo and rhythm of pieces as well as transitions from one section to another, while one instrument gives melodic cues to indicate treatment or sections of a piece. Some of the instruments that make up a gamelan in present-day Central Java are shown below:&lt;ref name=drummond&gt;Drummond, Barry.

==Varieties==
{{See also|List of gamelan varieties}}
Varieties of gamelan are distinguished by their collection of instruments and use of voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and cultural context. In general, no two gamelan ensembles are the same, and those that arose in prestigious courts are often considered to have their own style and tuning. Certain styles may also be shared by nearby ensembles, leading to a regional style.

The varieties are generally grouped geographically, with the principal division between the styles favored by the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] peoples. The Madurese also had their own style of gamelan, although it is no longer in use, and the last orchestra is kept at the Sumenep palace.&lt;ref&gt;''Across Madura Strait: the dynamics of an insular society'', edited by Kees van Dijk, Huub de Jonge and Elly Touwen-Bouwsma.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=missing year and page}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important style of Sundanese gamelan is  ''[[Gamelan Degung]]'', which uses a subset of gamelan instruments with a particular mode of ''[[pelog]]'' scale. Balinese gamelan is often associated with the virtuosity and rapid changes of tempo and dynamics of ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]'', its best-known style. Other popular Balinese styles include ''[[Kecak]]'', a theatrical dance and music form also known as the "monkey chant." Javanese gamelan, largely dominated by the courts of the 19th century central Javanese rulers, each with its own style,  is known for a slower, more meditative quality than the gamelan music of Bali.  Javanese gamelan can be made from iron or brass; instruments  made of cast bronze are considered the best quality.

Outside the main core on [[Java]] and [[Bali]], gamelan has spread through migration and cultural interest, new styles sometimes resulting as well. [[Malay Gamelan]] comes from the Javanese tradition through Riau-Lingga which later formed its own distinct identity,  using fewer instruments tuned in a near-equidistant ''slendro'', and often using a western B{{music|b}} or C as a tuning basis. Javanese emigrants to Suriname play gamelan in a style close to that found in Central Javanese villages.  Gamelan is also related to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ''[[kulintang]]'' ensemble. The variety of gamelan can befound in over 25 countries outside Indonesia, presenting both traditional and experimental repertoire.

In oral Javanese culture distinctions are made between complete or incomplete, archaic and modern, and large standard and small village gamelan. The various archaic ensembles are distinguished by their unique combinations of instruments and possession of obsolete instruments such as the bell-tree (''byong'') in the 3-toned ''gamelan kodhok ngorek''. Regionally variable village gamelan are often distinguished from standard gamelan (which have the ''rebab'' as the main melodic instrument) by their inclusion of a double-reed wind (''selompret'', ''slompret'', or ''sompret'') in addition to variable drum and gong components, with some also including the shaken bamboo ''angklung''.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret (1990). ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments''. University of Chicago Press, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
[[File:Javanese Gamelan.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Javanese gamelan ensemble with two female ''[[sindhen]]'' (choral singer) during traditional Javanese wedding at Sasono Utomo, [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]

In Indonesia, gamelan often accompanies dance, ''[[wayang]]'' puppet performances, or rituals and ceremonies. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of dance in Central Java in [[Surakarta]], see Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/30/dancing-mangkunegara.html Dancing at the Mangkunegara'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[wayang]]'', the ''[[dhalang|dalang]]'' (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan can be performed by itself&amp;nbsp;– in "''klenengan''" style, or for radio broadcasts&amp;nbsp;– and concerts presentation are common in national arts conservatories founded in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, et al., eds. ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: The Rough Guides, 1994. {{ISBN|1-85828-017-6}}. Page 419–420.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamelan's role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying, "It is not official until the gong is hung".&lt;ref name="B420"&gt;Broughton, 420&lt;/ref&gt; Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the [[sultan of Yogyakarta]]. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the ''[[Gamelan Sekaten]]'', which is used in celebration of ''[[Mawlid an-Nabi]]'' ([[Muhammad]]'s birthday). In [[Bali]], almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the [[Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholic church in Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When an "ending" piece (such as "[[Udan Mas]]") is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers, and can be used to ward off evil spirits.&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt;

Gamelan is frequently played on the radio. For example, the ''[[Pura Pakualaman]]'' gamelan performs live on the radio every ''Minggu Pon'' (a day in the 35-day cycle of the [[Javanese calendar]]).&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt; In major towns, the [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] employs professional musicians and actors, and broadcast programs of a wide variety of gamelan music and drama.&lt;ref name="B421"&gt;Broughton, 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the court tradition of central [[Java]], gamelan is often played in the ''[[pendopo]]'', an open pavilion with a cavernous, double-pitched roof, no side walls, and a hard marble or tile floor. The instruments are placed on a platform to one side, which allows the sound to reverberate in the roof space and enhances the acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 17&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bali Lion Dance.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Gamelan ensemble (or [[Beleganjur|gambelan]] in Balinese term) accompanying [[Barong (mythology)|barong]] performance (Bali [[lion dance]]) at [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park|Garuda Wisnu Kencana cultural complex]].]]
In [[Bali]], the Gamelan instruments are all kept together in a ''balé'', a large open space with a roof over the top of it and several open sides. Gambelan (the [[Balinese language|Balinese]] term) are owned by a ''[[banjar (Bali)|banjar]]'', nobility or temples and kept in their respective compounds.

In case of ''banjar'' ownership the instruments are all kept there together because people believe that all the instruments belong to the community as a whole and that no one person has ownership over an instrument.  Not only is this where the instruments are stored, but this is also the practice space for the ''sekaha'' (Gamelan orchestra group). The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people may enjoy it. Balinese gamelan cannot be heard inside closed rooms, because it easily crosses the [[Threshold of pain#In hearing|threshold of pain]]. This does not apply to small ensembles like a gamelan ''[[gendér]]''.

The ''sekaha'' is led by a single instructor whose job it is in the community to lead this group and to come up with new pieces. When they are working on a new piece, the instructor will lead the group in practice and help the group form the new music as they are practicing. When the instructor creates a new song, he leaves enough open for interpretation that the group can improvise, so the group will write the music as they practice it.

There are many styles in Balinese gamelan. ''[[Kebyar]]'' is one of the most recent ones. Some Balinese gamelan groups constantly change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as trying new variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed.

Men and women usually perform in separate groups, with the exception in Java of the ''[[pesindhen]]'', the female singer who performs with male groups.&lt;ref name="B421"/&gt;

In the twenty-five countries outside Indonesia that have gamelan, music performed in a concert context or as part of ceremonies for expat communities&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.balipuspa.de/Kuningan%20im%20rjm.htm Kuningan: Ein Balinesisches Kulturfest]", ''BaliPusa.de''. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; may also accompany [[Indonesian dance|dance]] or ''[[wayang]]''.

==Tuning==
[[File:165 Museu de la Música, gamelan.jpg|thumb|Gamelan in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]]]
[[File:Traditional indonesian stringed instrument.jpg|thumb|''[[Celempung]]''&amp;nbsp;– Indonesian Embassy in [[Canberra]]]]

The tuning and construction of a gamelan orchestra is a complex process.&lt;ref&gt;Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/07/ki-saroyo-gamelan-making-maestro.html Ki Sarojo: Gamelan-making maestro'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 June 2012; Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/11/forging-gamelan-central-java.html Forging gamelan in Central Java'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Javanese gamelan use two [[musical tuning|tuning systems]]: ''[[sléndro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]''. There are other tuning systems such as ''[[degung]]'' (exclusive to Sunda, or West Java), and ''[[madenda]]'' (also known as ''diatonis'', similar to a European [[natural minor scale]]). In central Javanese gamelan, ''sléndro'' is a system with five [[Musical note|note]]s to the [[octave]], with large intervals, while ''pélog'' has seven notes to the octave, with uneven [[interval (music)|intervals]], usually played in five note subsets of the seven-tone collection.  A full gamelan will include a set of instruments in each tuning, and classically only one tuning is used at a time. The precise tuning used differs from ensemble to ensemble, and gives each ensemble its own particular flavour. A set of gamelan instruments will be tuned to the same set of notes, but the tuning will vary from one gamelan to the next, including variations in the size of intervals.

[[Colin McPhee]] , a Canadian composer who spent much time in Bali, remarked, "Deviations in what is considered the same scale are so large that one might with reason state that there are as many scales as there are gamelans."&lt;ref&gt;Colin McPhee, ''Music in Bali''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contested, however, by some teachers of gamelan, and there have been efforts to combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan to ease transportation at festival time. One such ensemble is gamelan ''Manikasanti'', which can play the repertoire of many different ensembles.

Balinese gamelan instruments are built in pairs that are tuned slightly apart to produce interference [[beat (acoustics)|beats]], ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. This concept is referred to as "ombak," translating to "wave," communicating the idea of cyclical undulation. One instrument, tuned slightly higher, is thought of as the "inhale," and the other, slightly lower, is called the "exhale." [Also called the "blower" and the "sucker," or ''pengimbang'' and ''pengisep'' in Bali.] When the inhale and the exhale are combined, beating is produced, meant to represent the beating of the heart, or the symbol of being alive. It is thought that this contributes to the "shimmering" sound of Balinese gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain gamelan, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god's presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state. The scale roughly approximates that of the [[phrygian mode]] of the Western major scale (E-E on the white keys of the piano), with the notes EFGBC corresponding to the note positions 12356 in the ''slendro'' scale used by most gamelan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cnx.org/content/m15795/latest/ Listening to Balinese Gamelan: A Beginners' Guide]" from ''Connexions.com'' retrieved 20/01/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the non-western octave and the use of beats, [[Java]]nese gamelan uses a combination of tempo and density known as ''[[Irama]]'', relating how many beats on the ''[[saron panerus]]'' instrument there are to notes in the core melody or ''[[balungan]]''; density is considered primary.&lt;ref&gt;Sumarsan. ''Gamelan: cultural interaction and musical development in central Java''. University of Chicago Press, 2nd Edition, 1996. page 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
{{further|Musical notation#Indonesia}}

Gamelan music is traditionally not notated and began as an [[oral tradition]]. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These were not used to read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the [[balungan]] (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a ''[[gatra (music)|gatra]]'') are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the [[colotomy|colotomic or metric structure]] of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer. ''Javanese Gamelan''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979. Pp. 27–28. {{ISBN|0-19-580413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today this notation is relatively rare, and has been replaced by [[kepatihan notation]], which is a cipher system. Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the [[kepatihan]] Palace in Surakarta, which had become a high-school conservatory. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales ''[[slendro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]'' for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots below or above the numbers indicating the register, and lines above notes showing time values; In vocal notation, there are also brackets under groups of notes to indicate melisma. Like the palace notation, however, Kepatihan records mostly the ''balungan'' part and its metric phrases as marked by a variety of gongs. The other parts are created in real time, and depend on the knowledge each musician has of his instrument, and his awareness of what others are playing; this "realization" is sometimes called "garap." Some teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the ''[[cengkok]]'' (melodic patterns) of the [[elaborating instruments]]. Some ethnomusicologists, trained in European music, may make transcriptions onto a Western staff. This entails particular challenges of tuning and time, sometimes resulting in unusual [[clef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Sorrell, Neil. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. United Kingdom: Faber and Faber, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Western music==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60043216.jpg|thumb|Gamelan orchestra in [[East Java]], late 19th century]]
The gamelan has been appreciated by several western composers of [[European classical music|classical music]], most famously [[Claude Debussy]] who heard a Javanese gamelan in the premiere of [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]]'s ''Rhapsodie Cambodgienne'' at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]] ([[World's Fair]]). The work had been written seven years earlier in 1882, but received its premiere only in 1889. The gamelan Debussy heard in it was in the ''slendro'' scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Pages 2–7 discuss the incident, about which much remains uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether they played the [[Cirebon]]ese instruments that the [[Paris Conservatoire]] received in 1887, which would be substantially different from their ordinary set, or if they brought their own set.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy's own compositions. However, the equal-tempered [[whole tone scale]] appears in his music of this time and afterward,&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Although the five notes of the ''slendro'' set are closest in pitch to a [[pentatonic scale]], this scale would have been familiar from other folk sources, as it is a common scale worldwide. It is the equally tempered whole-tone scale that is more analogous of the exotic ''slendro'' scale.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in "Pagodes", from ''Estampes'' (solo piano, 1903), in which the [[gong ageng|great gong]]'s [[colotomy|cyclic punctuation]] is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.

The composer [[Erik Satie]], an influential contemporary of Debussy, also heard the Javanese gamelan play at the Paris Exposition of 1889.  The repetitively hypnotic effects of the gamelan were incorporated into Satie's exotic [[Gnossienne]] set for piano.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, Robert''Satie the Composer (Music in the Twentieth Century)''Cambridge University Press (October 26, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct homages to gamelan music are to be found in works for western instruments by [[John Cage]], particularly his [[prepared piano]] pieces, [[Colin McPhee]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bronislaw Kaper]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. In more recent times, American composers such as [[Henry Brant]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Dennis Murphy (musician)|Dennis Murphy]], [[Loren Nerell]], [[Michael Tenzer]], [[Evan Ziporyn]], [[Daniel James Wolf]] and [[Jody Diamond]] as well as Australian composers such as [[Peter Sculthorpe]], [[Andrew Schultz]] and [[Ross Edwards (composer)|Ross Edwards]] have written several works with parts for gamelan instruments or full gamelan ensembles. [[I Nyoman Windha]] is among contemporary Indonesian composers that have written compositions using western instruments along with Gamelan. Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]] wrote a piano étude called ''Galamb Borong'' influenced by gamelan. [[Avant-garde]] composer [[Harry Partch]], one of America's most idiosyncratic composers, was also influenced by Gamelan, both in his [[microtonal]] compositions and the instruments he built for their performance&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}", ''CoastOnline.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In jazz, the music of [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], especially his 1968 record ''Eternal Rhythm'', shows influences of gamelan music.

American folk guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] included elements of gamelan in many of his late-1960s sound collages, and again in his 1997 collaboration with [[Cul de Sac (band)|Cul de Sac]], ''The Epiphany of Glenn Jones.''

On the debut EP of [[Sonic Youth]] the track 'She's not Alone' has a gamelan timbre. Experimental pop groups [[The Residents]], [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]] (whose 1984 album was even titled ''Urban Gamelan''), [[Mouse on Mars]], [[His Name Is Alive]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Macha (band)|Macha]], Saudade, [[The Raincoats]] and the [[Sun City Girls]] have used gamelan percussion. Avant-garde performance band [[Melted Men]] uses Balinese gamelan instruments as well as gamelan-influenced costumes and dance in their shows. The [[Moodswinger]] built by [[Yuri Landman]] gives gamelan–like clock and bell sounds, because of its [[3rd bridge]] construction. Indonesian-Dutch composer [[Sinta Wullur]] has integrated Western music and gamelan for opera.

==Influence on contemporary music==
In contemporary [[Indonesian music]] scene, some groups fuse contemporary westernized [[jazz fusion]] music with the legacy of traditional [[ethnic music]] traditions. In the case of [[Krakatau (band)|Krakatau]] and [[SambaSunda]], the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese [[kacapi suling]] and gamelan degung Sunda orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars. Other bands such as Bossanova Java fused Javanese music with [[bossa nova]], while the Kulkul band fuse jazz with Balinese gamelan.

The Indonesian singer [[Anggun]] often incorporated in her works Indonesian traditional tunes from the gamelan and tembang style of singing. Typical gamelan tunes can be traced in several songs in her album ''[[Snow on the Sahara]]'' such as "[[Snow on the Sahara (song)|Snow on the Sahara]]", "[[A Rose in the Wind]]", and also in her collaboration works with [[Deep Forest]] on "Deep Blue Sea" on their 2002 album, ''Music Detected''. Philippine-born Indonesian singer [[Maribeth Pascua]] also features gamelan tunes in her songs ''Denpasar Moon'' and ''Borobudur''.

Beyond Indonesia, gamelan has also had an influence on [[J-pop|Japanese popular music]], specifically the [[synthpop]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Their 1981 record ''[[Technodelic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You're Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first albums to heavily rely on [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[Loop (music)|loops]], made use of gamelan elements and samples. Yellow Magic Orchestra member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] also used gamelan elements for his soundtrack to the 1983 British-Japanese film ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulvers|first=Roger|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto reminds Japanese what's the score on nuclear blame|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120701rp.html#.UA4RzrSe78k|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won him the 1983 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085933|Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many listeners were introduced to the sounds of gamelan by the popular 1988 Japanese [[anime]] film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''. Gamelan elements are used in this film to punctuate several exciting fight scenes, as well as to symbolize the emerging psychic powers of the tragic hero, Tetsuo. The gamelan in the film's score was performed by the members of the [[Japan]]ese musical collective [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]], using their ''semar pegulingan'' and ''jegog'' ensembles, which were also used in the previous album, ''Ecophony Rinne''. Gamelan and kecak are also used in the soundtrack to the video games ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. The two opening credits of 1998 Japanese [[Anime]] ''[[Neo Ranga]]'' use Balinese music (''Kecak'' and ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]''). Each "waking up" of Ranga in the anime uses the ''Gong Kebyar'' theme. The musical soundtrack for the Sci Fi Channel series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' features extensive use of the gamelan, particularly in the 3rd season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/81/ |title=SoundtrackNet 2/28/07 article |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as do [[Alexandre Desplat]]'s scores for ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]''. [[James Newton Howard]], who composed [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] 2001 feature film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', chose Gamelan for the musical theme of the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Various cast and crew members | title = Atlantis: The Lost Empire—Supplemental Material | medium = DVD | edition = Collector's | series = Disc 2 of 2 | date = January 29, 2002 | publisher = Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment | location = Burbank, CA | id = {{UPC|786936163872}} | ref = DVD2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loops of gamelan music appear in electronic music. An early example is the Texas band [[Drain (band)|Drain]]'s album ''Offspeed and In There'', which contains two tracks where trip-hop beats are matched with gamelan loops from Java and Bali and recent popular examples include the [[Sofa Surfers]]' piece ''Gamelan'', or ''EXEC_PURGER/.#AURICA extracting'', a song sung by [[Haruka Shimotsuki]] as part of the ''[[Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia]]'' soundtracks.

Gamelan influences can also be heard  in the 2004 award-winning pop song, ''Pulangkan'', a theme from the gamelan-cultural related film ''[[Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam]]'' by Malaysian songbird [[Misha Omar]] and also the 2006 hip hop song, Tokyo Drift (Fast &amp; Furious), by [[Teriyaki Boyz]].

In the ''[[Regular Show]]'' episode "150-Piece Kit", a gamelan is mentioned to be part of the eponymous kit.

==Gamelan outside Indonesia==

{{Main|Gamelan outside Indonesia}}

Gamelan is also found outside Indonesia. There are forms of gamelan that have developed outside Indonesia, such as [[American gamelan]] in the United States and [[Malay Gamelan]] in Malaysia. Gamelan has also become quite widespread along the South East of Sri Lanka, particularly with the Tamil community, and in Colombo, at the Indonesian Embassy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The '''ancient synagogue of Gaza''' was built in 508 AD during the [[Byzantine]] period and was discovered in 1965. It was located in the ancient port city of Gaza, then known as "[[Maiuma]]s", currently the [[Rimal]] district of [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues''].

==History==
[[Image:PikiWiki Israel 15077 Mosaic from the ancient synagogue in Gaza.JPG|thumb|Section of the synagogue's mosaic floor]]
In 1965, [[Egypt]]ian archaeologists discovered the site and announced they had uncovered a church.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Kestenbaum Green. [http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Gaza_Synagogue_Mosaic,_6th_century_CE King David’s Head from Gaza Synagogue Restored], ''Biblical Archaeology Review Magazine'' (Mar/Apr 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Later a mosaic of [[King David]] wearing a crown and playing a lyre, labelled in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], was found. The mosaic was dated to 508-09 CE and measured {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high by {{convert|1.9|m|ft|sp=us}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues''].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&amp;pg=PA418 International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J], p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally described as depicting a female saint playing the harp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=20&amp;Issue=2&amp;ArticleID=5 King David’s Head from Gaza Synagogue Restored]&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian archaeologists stated that the mosaic was in fact an [[Orpheus mosaic]], a [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] who was commonly associated with Christ or David and used in [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref name="IsraelMuseum"&gt;[http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/article_21.aspx?c0=13031&amp;bsp=13013 Israel Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the mosaic's discovery, the main figure's face was gouged out. When Israel captured the [[Gaza Strip]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the mosaic was transferred to the [[Israel Museum]] for restoration.&lt;ref name="IsraelMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=838459&amp;ct=1104189 The Arab Campaign to Destroy Israel], ''American Jewish Committee''&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic floor of the synagogue is on show at the Museum of the Good Samaritan, located on the Jerusalem-Jericho Road near [[Ma'ale Adumim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosaicmatters.co.uk/news/news_westbankmuseum.htm Mosaic museum opens in the West Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I. Yakubovich. 2016. Sumerograms and Akkadograms in Hittite: Ideograms, Logograms, Allograms, or
Heterograms? ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10964">'''Hypergravity''' is defined as the condition where the [[force]] of [[gravity]] exceeds that on the surface of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Hypergravity?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Hypergravity&amp;sa=Search#922 |title=
Specialty Definition: Hypergravity |author= |work=Websters Online Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed as being greater than 1 g. Hypergravity conditions are created on Earth for research on [[human physiology]] in aerial combat and space flight, as well as testing of materials and equipment for space missions. Manufacturing of titanium aluminide turbine blades in 20 g is being explored by researchers at the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

All of this is of extreme importance because human physiology and materials are used to build planes, spaceships and structures, which are all accustomed to Earth’s normal gravity.
NASA scientists have recently been looking at meteorite impacts, and after testing certain strains of bacteria, they discovered that most strains were able to reproduce under pressures exceeding 7,500 g’s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universetoday.com/89416/hypergravity/{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 times "g" (the normal acceleration due to gravity on Earth). Another study that has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that some bacteria can exist even in extreme "hypergravity". In other words, they can still live and breed despite gravitational forces that are 400,000 times greater than what's felt here on Earth.
''Paracoccus denitrificans'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful  growth under '''hypergravity'''. The research has implications on the feasibility of existence of [[exobacteria]] and [[panspermia]]. A concern of this practice is rapid spinning. If someone moves their head too quickly while they're inside a fast-moving centrifuge, they might feel uncomfortably like they're tumbling head over heels. This can happen when balance-sensing fluids in the semicircular canals of the inner ear become "confused". Some experiments using centrifuges often include devices that fix the subjects' heads in place to prevent that illusion. Traveling through space, however, with one's head fixed in place is not practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |work=National Geographic- Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018027108 |pmid=21518884 |pmc=3093466 |title=Microbial growth at hyperaccelerations up to 403,627 × ''g'' |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=19 |pages=7997–8002 |year=2011 |last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige |author3=Mikiko Tsudome |author4=Sada-atsu Mukai |author5=Robert W.

Researchers calculated from a weight loss experiment that using 5&amp;nbsp;lb. ankle weights and 2.5&amp;nbsp;lb. wrist weights would have a 14% improved NEAT calorie burn while doing household chores. Track and basketball primarily plyometric) metrics improved by 8–25% mostly depending upon if the subjects used weighted vests all day or only when training, but the effect disappeared after a month of not using hypergravity training.

Researchers reported that the high-gravity level can effectively affect the phase composition and morphology of the products.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Effects on rate of aging of rats==
Ever since Pearl proposed the rate of living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study was based on the finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 ''g'' in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory control ratio, P less than 0.05).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0167-4943(82)90035-8 |pmid=7186330 |title=Effects of simulated increased gravity on the rate of aging of rats: Implications for the rate of living theory of aging |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=349–63 |year=1982 |last1=Economos |first1=A.C. |last2=Miquel |first2=J. |last3=Ballard |first3=R.C. |last4=Blunden |first4=M. |last5=Lindseth |first5=K.A. |last6=Fleming |first6=J. |last7=Philpott |first7=D.E. |last8=Oyama |first8=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483–572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502–615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms.

==Effects on the behavior of adult rats==
Pups from gestating rats exposed to hypergravity (1.8 G) or to normal gravity at the perinatal period were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thullier|first1=F.|last2=Hayzoun|first2=K.|last3=Dubois|first3=M.|last4=Lestienne|first4=F.|last5=Lalonde|first5=R.|title=Exploration and motor activity in juvenile and adult rats exposed to hypergravity at 1.8 G during development: a preliminary report.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=2002|volume=76|pages=617–622|doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00766-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison to controls, the hypergravity group had shorter latencies before choosing a maze arm in a T-maze and fewer exploratory pokes in a hole board. During dyadic encounters, the hypergravity group had a lower number of self-grooming episodes and shorter latencies before crossing under the opposing rat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">{{Roman Catholicism}}
'''Indifferentism''', in the Roman Catholic faith, is the belief held by some that no one religion or philosophy is superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indifferentism |title=Indifferentism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] ascribes indifferentism to many [[atheism|atheistic]], [[materialism|materialistic]], [[pantheism|pantheistic]], and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] philosophies. There are three basic types of indifferentism described by [[Catholic apologetics]]: absolute, restricted, and liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism. Indifferentism was first explicitly identified and opposed by [[Pope Gregory XVI]], in his encyclical ''[[Mirari vos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16mirar.htm |title=Mirari Vos |publisher=Papalencyclicals.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Indifferentism is to be distinguished from political indifferentism, which is applied to the policy of a state that treats all the religions within its borders as being on an equal footing before the law of the country. Indifferentism is not to be confounded with religious indifference. The former is primarily a theory disparaging the value of religion; the latter term designates the conduct of those who, whether they do or do not believe in the necessity and utility of religion, do in fact neglect to fulfill its duties.

==Catholic teachings on indifferentism==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the belief that one [[religion]] is as good as another, and that all religions are equally valid paths to [[salvation]], is believed to be obviously false, on the grounds that nobody honestly believes that, for instance, a religion based on human sacrifice and the subjugation of rivals is as good, true, and beautiful as one based on heroic love of God and neighbor. The  condemnation of Indifferentism as a heresy is closely linked to the [[dogmatic definition]] that [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|outside the Church there is no salvation]], a complex idea postulating that many people are followers of Christ without any specific understanding that it is in fact Jesus whom they are following. See also the Catholic concept of the [[Baptism of desire|"Baptism of Desire"]]. In support of this stance the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has said "This does not lessen the sincere respect that the Church has for the various religious traditions, recognizing in them elements of truth and goodness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20021124_politica_en.html#_ftn30 |title=Doctrinal Note on some questions regarding the participation of Catholics in political life |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute indifferentism===
[[Immanuel Kant]] argues that absolute indifferentism represents an extreme form of skepticism that argues that there is no rational ground for accepting any philosophical position,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, D.A. "Kant, Bayle and Indifferentism," ''The Philosophical Review,'' 63(4) {{doi|10.2307/2182293}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that matches the Roman Catholic understanding of the term. According to the Catholic Church, this type of absolute indifferentism results in a willingness to concede any position.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. (1910). Religious Indifferentism. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved December 17, 2010 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07759a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[moral relativism]].

===Restricted indifferentism===
Catholicism also opposes as "indifferentism" a spectrum of pragmatic ideas that admit the necessity of religion because of its positive influence on human life; but which hold that all religions are equally true. The classic advocate of this theory is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who maintains, in his ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'', that God looks only to the sincerity of intention, and that everybody can serve Him by remaining in the religion in which they were raised, or by converting to any other that pleases them more (Emile, III). This doctrine is widely advocated today on the grounds that, beyond the truth of God's existence, we can attain to no certain religious knowledge; and that, since God has left us thus in uncertainty, He will be pleased with whatever form of worship we sincerely offer Him. This idea appears to be tenable only in a cultural context that takes most core ethical beliefs for granted: it runs into serious trouble as soon as the basis of ethics comes into question. 

From a Roman Catholic perspective, to say that all these [[argument from inconsistent revelations|irreconcilable beliefs]] are equally pleasing to God is to say that God has no preference for truth and to deny reason. The Roman Catholic Church argues that restricted indifferentism is no different from absolute indifferentism because while nominally acknowledging the utility of religion, to affirm that "all religions are equally good" ultimately means that religion is good for nothing.

===Liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism===
The [[Catholic Church]] also resists as indifferentism the belief that, since [[Christianity]] is the true religion,  it makes no difference which of the several Christian [[religious denomination|denominations]] the believer chooses to join.  Catholicism critiques [[Protestantism]] specifically for this sort of limited indifferentism, noting that many Protestant denominations do not claim any particular fidelity to the gospel, while maintaining that all forms of worship may be equally (read "indifferently") effective for the purpose of building a closer union with God: a [[latitudinarianism|latitudinarian]] position. [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly criticized the [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical movement]] on these grounds in his encyclical, ''Mortalium animos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19280106_mortalium-animos_en.html |title=Pius XI, Mortalium animos (06/01/1928) |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1928-01-06 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Catholic perspective, this form of indifferentism is rather like saying, "It makes no difference what tools and materials are used to build a house, it will turn out just fine, no matter what you do or don't do."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

The '''internal consistency of the Bible''' concerns the coherence and textual integrity of the [[Bible]]. Disputes regarding biblical consistency have a long history.&lt;!--Summary evidences in article, no source needed!--&gt;

Classic texts that discuss questions of inconsistency from a critical secular perspective include the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' by [[Baruch Spinoza]], the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' of [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paine | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Paine | title = Writings of Thomas Paine — Volume 4 (1794–1796): the Age of Reason by Paine | publisher = Project Gutenberg | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3743 | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy}}
For many believers, the internal consistency of the Jewish and Christian scriptures is important because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin.{{cn|date=August 2018}} On the subject of the Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the [[Torah]] that "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the [[Hebrew Bible]] or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected [[rabbinic]] leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;Golding, JL., ''Rationality and Religious Theism'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p.106
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Christian evangelists [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Dillon Burroughs]] state that "the Bible's teachings, if perfect, must be consistent with one another" and that "the Bible is consistent with itself from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, J. and Burroughs, D., ''Taking a Stand for the Bible: Today's Leading Experts Answer Critical Questions about God's Word'', Harvest House Publishers, 2009, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Catholic writers have argued that "If we believe the Scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, S., and Mitch, C., ''Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon'', Ignatius Press, 2013, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor [[Erwin Lutzer]] argues that the Bible is consistent in asserting that it is the word of God, and that this is a reason for accepting that it is of divine origin: "The sixty-six books speak with a consistent voice that these are the words of God".&lt;ref&gt;Lutzer, EW., ''Seven Reasons Why You Can Trust the Bible'', Moody Publishers, 2008, pp. 16 &amp; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of traditional Jewish and Christian belief have also argued that inconsistencies undermine the value of scripture. The [[deist]] minister [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]], speaking in 1854, described the Bible as "the most inconsistent, the most monstrous and blasphemous representations of God that can possibly be conceived by the human mind" and argued that "The book that contradicts science and contradicts itself is a book of no authority whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Hartford Bible Convention'', Partridge &amp; Brittan, 1854, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern Islamic critic writes that if the Bible can be shown to be inconsistent, "then those who preach the Bible and read the Bible must seriously reconsider their source of information concerning their faith."&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Abdul Mahaimin, ''Jesus and the Bible'', Islamic Books, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to this kind of criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist. As theologian [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] explains, some Christians read the Bible with the assumption that "Scripture is ''self-consistent''", and that if there appear to be contradictions between two texts, they believe that "more careful reading is required to show that they really cohere". Barton states that "this is not the Bible that we have in fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" and "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J., ''The Bible: The Basics'', Routledge, 2010. pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christian writers, however, while agreeing that inaccuracies and inconsistencies occur, argue that these do not necessarily make the Bible false&lt;ref&gt;Giles, T., ''A Doubter's Guide to the Bible'', Abingdon Press, 2010, Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is no longer desirable to try to [[Gospel harmony|harmonize all four Gospels into "one consistent account"]], because "we have learned that each of the four Gospels has its own ... unique image of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, JD. and Garvey, SJ., ''Why a Church Catholic?'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randel Helms]] argues that the books of the Bible were written for and against different points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write because they wanted to challenge or correct those who had written before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Randel |authorlink= |title=The Bible Against Itself: Why the Bible Seems to Contradict Itself |accessdate= |year=2006  |publisher=Millennium Press |location= |isbn=0-9655047-5-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMqWPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Bible+against+itself&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV09XX-KTJAhXDGz4KHSukBcEQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy|Divine inspiration}}

===Jewish===
The [[Torah]] is viewed by some as the literal word of God, [[Mosaic authorship|dictated to Moses]]. According to the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]], "The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neviim|Prophets]], such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Jonah]], are said to have heard and reported the word of God,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Isaacs, RH., ''Messengers of God: A Jewish Prophets Who's who'', Jason Aronson, 1998, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Kethuvim|Writings]] (the category that includes books such as [[Psalms]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) "were excluded from the prophetic collection because their inspiration appeared to be human rather than Divine".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, pp. 577–578.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "In the broadest sense, the Scriptures taken as a whole, and subsequently the totality of Jewish spiritual teaching, fall within the connotation of God's word."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 21, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern Jewish scholars have an accommodating view of the nature of the Torah, not necessarily viewing it as strictly internally consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===
{{See also|Biblical inspiration}}
[[Justin Martyr]], a 2nd-century Christian writer, declared the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] generally preferred in the early Church, to be "completely free of errors".&lt;ref&gt;Hengel, M.,
The Septuagint as a Collection of Writings Claimed by Christians:
Justin and the Church Fathers before Origen, in Dunn, JDG., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C&amp;dq=%27%27JEWS+AND+CHRISTIANS+The+Parting+of+the+Ways&amp;q=septuagint+free+errors#v=snippet&amp;q=septuagint%20free%20errors&amp;f=false ''Jews and Christians''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote that "the author of Holy Scripture is God".&lt;ref&gt;"Quod auctor sacrae Scripturae est Deus". [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/st_q1.html Article 10].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) asserts that the Bible's authority depends "wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter I, Paragraph iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches follow the Jewish practice of describing certain books as [[apocrypha]] (although not all churches regard the same list of books as apocryphal, see also [[biblical apocrypha]]).

Assertions that the Bible contains inconsistencies contradicts [[Martin Luther]]'s statement that "God cannot lie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar37.htm |title="Lessons from Luther on the Inerrancy of Holy Writ" Luther, Martin. '&amp;#39;Weimarer Ausgabe'&amp;#39; 10 III, 162 |publisher=Mtio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther accepted that mistakes and inconsistencies existed, but concluded that they did not necessarily undermine the truth of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

German Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]] took a different view, proposing in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) a number of attempted [[Gospel harmony|harmonisations]], including the suggestion that Jesus must have been [[Crown of Thorns|crowned with thorns]] twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian approaches to biblical consistency are reminiscent of the split between Luther and Osiander, and can be broadly divided between [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] and [[biblical infallibility|infallibility]]. The former, followed by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and by [[evangelical Christians]] in the United States in general, holds that the original [[biblical manuscript]]s have "God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter", so that "all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp |title=The Baptist Faith and Message, I. The Scriptures |publisher=Sbc.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gleason Archer]], whose reconciliation of difficult texts echoes that of Osiander, allow that textual scholarship and an understanding of the historical context of individual passages is necessary to establish true, original biblical text, but that that text, once discovered, is without error.

The infallibility approach followed by some theologians and scholars, primarily of the Catholic and Anglican churches, and some mainline Protestant denominations, avoids many of the pitfalls of inerrancy by holding that the Bible is without error only in matters essential to salvation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration", 65:29–50, pp. 1029f}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that guidance is necessary for the correct interpretation of apparent inconsistencies; the latter part being common to all Orthodox and Catholic Christians, regardless of views of biblical inerrancy, being the primary role of the [[magisterium]].

According to Roman Catholic biblical scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]], this approach found expression in ''[[Dei verbum]]'', one of the key documents adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], which stated that scripture teaches "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm ''Dei verbum'', Chapter III, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that Scripture is [[biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] only "to the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God,"&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, ''The Critical Meaning of the Bible'', Paulist Press (1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. Branick, ''Understanding the New Testament and Its Message: An Introduction'', (Paulist Press, 1998), p. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; without necessarily being reliable on matters such as paleontology or political history; this view is challenged by some conservative Catholic scholars.&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration"|quote="Clearly, Vatican II intended to recapitulate traditional teaching on inspiration....In this regard, Vatican II's statement on inspiration concurs with the views of many evangelical Christians."

===Muslim===
In the Middle Ages, [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] such as [[Ibn Hazm]], [[al-Qurtubi]], [[al-Maqrizi]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Izhar ul-Haqq]], Ch. 1 Sect. 4 titled ([[s:ar:إظهار الحق/القول في التوراة والإنجيل|القول في التوراة والإنجيل]]).&lt;/ref&gt; based on their interpretation of [[Quran]]ic and other traditions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s explication of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]'s&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] had tampered with the scriptures, a concept known as ''[[tahrif]]''.

The theme of ''tahrif'' was first explored in the writings of Ibn Hazm (10th century), who rejected claims of [[Mosaic authorship]] and posited that [[Ezra]] was the author of the Torah. His arguments against the authenticity of the biblical text in both the [[Tanakh]] and New Testament included chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; what he considered theological impossibilities ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] expressions, stories of [[extramarital sex]], and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as what he saw as a lack of reliable transmission (''[[tawatur]]'') of the text. He argued that the falsification of the Torah could have taken place while there existed only one copy kept by the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Ibn Hazm's arguments had a major impact upon Muslim literature and scholars, and these and other [[polemic]]al ideas were modified only slightly by some later authors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Power in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century'', chapter "An Andalusi-Muslim Literary Typology of Jewish Heresy and Sedition", pp. 56 and further, Tahrif: p. 58, {{ISBN|0-691-00187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Under Crescent and Cross'': The Jews in the Middle Ages, p. 146, {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Layth, Ibn Rabban, and [[Ibn Qutayba]], found that there had been no corruption of the text but denounced as ''tahrif'' what they considered misleading interpretations of the text.&lt;ref name="Adang1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camilla Adang|title=Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4Ut1MjLQTMC&amp;pg=PA223|date=1 January 1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10034-3|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century commentator [[Ibn Khaldun]] argued in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction) that no distortion had taken place: "the statement concerning the alteration is unacceptable to thorough scholars and cannot be understood in its plain meaning".&lt;ref name="Sawyer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F.

==Biblical criticism and criticism of the Bible==
{{Main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}
The study of inconsistencies in the Bible has a long history. In the 17th century, [[Spinoza]] considered the Bible to be, "...a book rich in contradictions."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', SUNY Press, 1997, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, [[Thomas Paine]] in [[The Age of Reason]] compiled many of the Bible's self-contradictions. And in 1860, William Henry Burr produced a list of 144 self-contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, WH., ''Self-Contradictions of the Bible'', 1860, reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biblical studies|Biblical scholars]] have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons as a means to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it. The field has been given rise to theories such as [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s&lt;ref&gt;
Wellhausen, J., ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel: With a Reprint of the Article 'Israel' from the Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1885. reprinted Cambridge University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[documentary hypothesis]] and the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|deuteronomistic history]] (concerning the origins of the Torah and the history of Israel contained in the books from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]] respectively),&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, SL., ''The trouble with Kings: the composition of the book of Kings in the Deuteronomistic history'', Supplements to Vetus testamentum, Brill, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and similar theories to explain why the [[Synoptic Gospels]] disagree with each other, and with the [[Gospel of John]].

===Biblical canons===
{{See also|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
The question of inconsistency covers not only the text but even the composition of scripture. Since the Bible never enumerates its own component parts, those who believe it is inerrant must appeal to extra-biblical authority to justify which books to include.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Taylor, ''The Faith of a Moralist'' (Macmillan, London, 1930) II, p. 209; quoted in Brand Blanchard, ''Reason and Belief'' (Allen and Unwin, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, different communities have accepted shifting collections of books. The size of these [[biblical canon]]s varies enormously, from the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritans]], who consider the five books of the [[Torah]] alone to be authoritative,&lt;ref&gt;The Pentateuch, or Torah, is the first five books of the bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Ethiopian Bible]], which contains all the books of all other churches plus such titles as the [[Josippon|Book of Josephus]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement|Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The contents of canons have varied over time, books regarded as authoritative by some Christians at some points in history being excluded from the collections of later communities—this was the fate of the [[List of gospels|many apocryphal Gospels]] from the first few centuries of the Church (the [[Gospel of Thomas]] is a famous example); books long regarded as canonical in one branch of Christianity may be dropped by others on doctrinal grounds (the fate of the [[deuterocanonical books]], canonical in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] but repudiated by the Protestants because they are not included in the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;"More Than One Bible." Christian History, issue 43, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported doctrines to which the [[Protestant reformation|Protestant reformers]] objected such as the [[intercession of saints]], [[purgatory]], [[prayers for the dead]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780865543737|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1995-02-13 |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780802837813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some books that could have been included, such as the [[Book of Enoch]], quoted as scriptural in {{bibleverse||Jude|1:14-15|KJV}}, were excluded from the canons of almost all later communities (see [[Book of Enoch#Canonicity|Canonicity of the Book of Enoch]]).

===Attribution of the books===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The question of internal consistency in the Bible also involves the attribution of authorship to its books. For instance, the words of the Torah, or the first five books of the Old Testament, have traditionally been believed to be by the hand of [[Moses]], and the New Testament Gospels have been attributed to the [[Four Evangelists]]. Modern scholarship calls these attributions into question.

Eliot Rabin writes: "For the past 400 years, readers have been openly questioning the traditional attribution of these five books to Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he quotes [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1651 [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] as writing that, when Genesis 12:6 has "and the Canaanite was then in the land", it could not have been written by Moses. Hobbes may have been the first European to question this attribution in print, arguing that the words can "only sensibly be used by someone who is writing when the Canaanites no longer are in the land ... But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive."&lt;ref&gt;Martinich AP., ''The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin also quotes the 11th-century rabbi, [[Rashi]], as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by [[Joshua]]. However, it is also noted that the second-century commentator [[Rabbi Meir]], has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In none of the four [[Gospels]] does the text say that a particular book is written by the evangelist who is attributed as its author. Writers such as M. N. Ralph say that in reading the Gospels one will be struck by "a great deal of evidence" that they are compilations inherited from written and oral sources "rather than eyewitness accounts". So scholars conclude that the attributions are "not to the person who compiled it."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, MN., ''A Walk Through the New Testament: An Introduction for Catholics'', Paulist Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===
{{Further information|Biblical manuscript|Textual criticism}}
Manuscripts also differ. Usually the differences are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note.&lt;ref name=DBWallace&gt;Daniel B. Wallace,"[http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1185 The Comma Johanneum and Cyprian]".&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the [[Septuagint]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] descriptions of the battle of [[David]] and [[Goliath]]: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of [[Saul]] asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.

There are also important differences between the Masoretic and [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] version of the [[Pentateuch]] in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between [[Judaism]] and [[Samaritanism]]. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like the inclusion of a passage in the Samaritan version of the [[Ten Commandments]] that restates the command to build an altar on [[Mount Gerizim]], and says plainly that Mount Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes sense that this passage is in one version and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.meson.org/religion/torahcompare.php |title=The Samaritan Pentateuch |publisher=Web.meson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictions===
Most questions of Biblical inconsistency relate to contradictions in the narrative. Some relate to apparently minor details, for example: the number of soldiers in an army (e.g. {{bibleverse|1|Chron.|21:5|niv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Sam.|24:9|niv}}), the year a certain king began his reign (e.g. {{bibleverse|2|Chron.|36:9|kjv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:8|kjv}}), the details of [[Apostle Paul]]'s itinerary (Acts 9,11,15,18:22,21 vs. Galatians 1:18,2:1). In some cases, seemingly trivial points of differences can actually have an enormous significance for the interpretation of a book or for the reconstruction of the history of Ancient Israel, how the world was created, why God allows suffering, or the religious significance of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;

And then there are instances that involve major issues, where one author has one point of view on an important topic  (How was the world created? Why do the people of God suffer? What is the significance of Jesus’ death?), and another author has another."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars find inconsistencies in the Old Testament and Torah and ascribe many of them to the process by which they were created. For example, the [[documentary hypothesis]] asserts that repetitions and contradictions are the result of texts that have been woven together from diverse sources written by different authors, at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Brettler|2004|pp=3–5}} "Slowly, with the rise of rationalism, particularly as associated with figures such as Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and especially Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632-1677), the view that the Torah was a unified whole, written by Moses, began to be questioned. ... This culminated in the development of the models of the Documentary Hypothesis in the 19th century, according to which the Torah (or Hexateuch) is composed of four main sources or documents which were edited or redacted together: J, E, P, and D. Each of these sources or documents is embedded in a (relatively) complete form in the current Torah, and is typified by vocabulary, literary style, and theological principles."&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Jensen wrote, "no better explanation has as yet been found of the complexities of composition of the [[Pentateuch]], and it continues to command a good consensus among scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jensen, ''God's Word to Israel'', Liturgical Press (September 1982), p. 36. {{ISBN|0-8146-5289-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this point, Ronald Witherup gives the example of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1-2, which most scholars view as two separate stories of creation written by different authors in different time periods. "Most biblical scholars accept Genesis 1 as originating around the sixth century B.C. with a group of scribes who were concerned about the preservation of the liturgical traditions of the Jews (thus the concern for the seven-day schema of creation and the notion of the sabbath). Genesis 2, on the other hand, originates from an earlier, more primitive tradition dated to around the tenth century B.C." Fundamentalists argue that this is simply the same story told twice, the first time (Gen 1:1-2:4) being poetic and the second one (Gen 2:4-25) being more anthropomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are further examples of other types of inconsistency in the Old Testament. In the account of the slaughtering of an animal before the Temple, it states that the animal: "was killed at the entrance to the tabernacle, north of the altar, and cut up." The most natural interpretation of the Hebrew wording is that the slaughtering was done by the one making the offering rather than by the priest. If so, it contradicts Ezek 44:11, where it is done by the Levites, and 2 Chr 29:22, 24 where done by the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several places in the Old Testament where numerical figures can be directly compared. For example, both {{bibleref2|Ezra|2:1–65|NIV}} and {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|7:6–67|NIV}} present the list of Jewish families that "came up out of [[Babylonian captivity|the captivity of the exiles]] ... and returned to Jerusalem and Judah". But the two lists disagree on the number of members of each family. In total, there are nearly ''twenty'' numerical discrepancies between the lists.&lt;ref&gt;The discrepancies occur in the following families: Arah, Pahath-Moab (through the line of Jeshua and Joab), Zattu, Bani, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, Adin, Bezai, Hashum, Bethlehem (and Netophah), Bethel (and Ai), Magbish, Lod (and Hadid and Ono), Senaah, Asaph, Shallum (and Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita and Shobai), Delaiah (and Tobiah and Nekoda), and the singers.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in both cases a total figure of 42,360 people is given,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:64|NASB}}; {{bibleverse|Nehemiah|7:66|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the partial figures do not add up to the total.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Lipschitz, Joseph Blenkinsopp, ''Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period'', (Eisenbrauns, 2003) p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the list exists in the apocryphal book [[1 Esdras]].

In Deuteronomy chapter 4, verses 1 and 8 state that Moses is about to teach the laws "today". Verse 8, in the Hebrew text, even says that the "entire Torah" is to be taught today. However, verse 5 suggests that the laws have already been delivered some time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, T., in Schipper, B. and Teeter DA. ''Wisdom and Torah: The Reception of ‘Torah’ in the Wisdom Literature of the Second Temple Period'', BRILL, 2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Bible Commentary'' notes that:
{{quote|as has long been recognized, there remain a number of variations or inconsistencies of detail, which suggests that two or more accounts have been combined. In particular, the creative acts are introduced in different ways. While in some cases God creates simply by speaking ("And God said..."), in others we are told that he performed certain actions: he made, separated, named, blessed, placed.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, orthodox rabbis, such as [[Mordechai Breuer]] deny that such inconsistencies are evidence that the words were not all created by God. He asserts that such hypotheses are false, and that the contradictory portrayals of creation are not because they were written by different authors. "Instead we refer them to the different qualities of God."&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, M., The study of the Bible and fear of Heaven, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, pp.159-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal consistency of the text===
Jewish scholars are concerned that all copies of the [[Torah]] are identical, and that each copy is consistent in its statements and in its language. The aim is to preserve the work in a condition as close to its original state as possible. This extends to consistency in spelling and the use of individual words.

B. Barry Levy notes that the 16th-century [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Rabbi Ibn Zimra]] recounted "how he restored the scrolls to their original state" and noted "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also suggests that "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked as carefully as possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Shnayer Leiman writes that, "Errors have crept into the best Torah scrolls. Every so often a Torah has to be returned to the ark due to an error discovered while being read in public."&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, SZ., Response to Rabbi Brewer, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several grammatical errors are known to appear in copies of the Torah. As Shai Cherry notes, "Since one of the Rabbinic assumptions is that the Torah is perfect, at a minimum one would expect there to be no grammatical mistakes. After all, shouldn't God be an inerrant grammarian?" For examples of such mistakes, Cherry notes that, in the Cain and Abel story, where 'sin' is mentioned, "''sin (chatat)'' is feminine, but the predicate is masculine." Rabbis have suggested that this is because sin starts out weak like a woman, but ends as strong as a man. Also, in verse 7 of this story, which concerns 'daughters' so that all four suffixes should be feminine, two of them are masculine. Cherry says that such problems ought to be ascribed to "sloppy editing," but that those who believe the Torah is perfect, would say that these errors were put there intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, S., ''Torah Through Time: Understanding Bible Commentary from the Rabbinic Period to Modern Times'', Jewish Publication Society, 2010, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Christian theologians agree that the New Testament has a single and consistent theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, while others are contradictory, even within the same book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf P. Knierim]], ''The Task of Old Testament Theology'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995), p. 1; Isaac Kalimi, "The Task of Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament Theology - Between Judaism and Christianity" in Wonil Kim, ''Reading the Hebrew Bible for a New Millennium'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of a single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) [[monotheism]], the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming [[Messiah]], and the concepts of [[sin]], faithfulness, and [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches. For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish expectation is different from the Christian view.

Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God ([[trinitarianism]] and [[nontrinitarianism]]),&lt;ref&gt;God as Communion By Patricia A. Fox, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|views of the old covenant]], [[original sin]], [[predestination]], [[ordination of women]], [[Hell in Christianity|hell]], [[Christian eschatological differences|biblical prophecies]], etc. have continued to be a matter of dispute among theologians and [[Religious denomination|various denominations]].

===New Testament===
{{main article|Textual criticism#New Testament}}
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th century CE [[Alexandrian text-type]]; the [[Western text-type]], also very early but prone to paraphrase and other corruptions; and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which makes up above 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition. Scholars regard the Alexandrian text-type as generally more authoritative when treating [[textual criticism|textual variations]]. The majority of differences are minor—matters such as variant spellings&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, "The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions &amp; To The Theory &amp; Practice Of Modern Text Criticism", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (June 1995). {{ISBN|0-8028-4098-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. F. Bruce|Bruce, Frederick Fyvie]], "''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?''", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (May 2003), {{ISBN|0-8028-2219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although at a few points the oldest manuscripts show important inconsistencies compared with the more recent ones: these include the endings of [[Mark 16]], describing Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, from the [[Gospel of Mark]]; the absence from [[Gospel of John|John]] of the story of [[Pericope Adulterae|the woman taken in adultery]]; and an explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]] (the [[Comma Johanneum]]). Scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]] have speculated that [[John 21]] was appended to the gospel at a later date&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166&lt;/ref&gt;, but no manuscript evidence for this assertion has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;
Felix Just, 'Combining Key Methodologies in Johannine Studies', in Tom Thatcher (ed), ''What We Have Heard from the Beginning: The Past, Present, and Future of Johannine Studies'', ([[Baylor University|Baylor University Press]], 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

All major modern Christian communions accept a uniform canon of 27 books, although a few small and isolated communities have either fewer or more. Nevertheless, the idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] has no foundation in history, and the [[canon of the New Testament]], like that of the Old, is the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|result of a historical process]]. The very idea of a closed canon did not exist prior to the 2nd century, when it became necessary to counter movements such as [[Marcionism]]. By the end of the 4th century unanimity had been achieved in the West concerning the New Testament canon as it is today, and by the 5th century most of the East had come into harmony by accepting the Book of Revelation. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon for Roman Catholicism was not made until the [[Council of Trent]] of 1546, as until then the authority of the Scriptures was not considered higher than that of Sacred Tradition, papal bulls, and ecumenical councils. Martin Luther revived the [[antilegomena]] dispute by suggesting the removal of Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; this was not generally accepted by his followers, but these books are still ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible. The canons of other important communions were defined in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Presbyterianism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

====Internal consistency====
Biblical scholar [[Bruce M. Metzger]] mentions several internal inconsistencies in the New Testament in earlier manuscripts that later scribes attempted to correct:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
In the earlier manuscripts of Mark 1:2, the composite quotation from Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3 is introduced by the formula "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet". Later scribes, sensing this involves a difficulty replaced "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet" with the general statement "As it is written in the prophets". Since the quotation Matthew(27:9) attributes to the prophet Jeremiah actually comes from Zechariah(11:12f), it is not surprising that some scribes sought to mend the error either by substituting the correct name or by omitting the name altogether. A few scribes attempted to harmonize the Johannine account of the chronology of the Passion with that in Mark by changing ’sixth hour’ of John 19:14 to ‘third hour’ (which appears in Mark 15:25). At John 1:28, [[Origen]] altered [[Bethany (Jerusalem)|Bethany]] to [[Bethabara]] in order to remove what he regarded as a geographical difficulty, and this reading is extant today in [[Manuscripts|MSS]]. 33 69 and many others, including those behind the [[King James version]]. The statement in Mark 8:31, that ‘the Son of man must suffer many things…and be killed and after three days rise again’, seems to involve a chronological difficulty, and some copyists changed the phrase to the more familiar expression, ‘on the third day’. The author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] places the golden [[altar of incense]] in the [[Holy of Holies]] (Heb. 9:4), which is contrary to the Old Testament description of the [[Tabernacle]] (Exod. 30:1-6).

In the 2nd century CE, [[Tatian]] produced a gospel text called [[Diatessaron]] by weaving together all four gospels into one. The gospel compilation eliminated all the discrepancies that exist between the four gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Encountering the Manuscripts By Philip Wesley Comfort, Philip Comfort&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it omits the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies of Jesus]] in Matthew and Luke. To fit in all canonical material, Tatian created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John's sequence.

====The Gospels====
{{See also|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
The problem of there being possible contradictions in the Gospels is of importance to Christians. As [[Francis Watson (priest)|Francis Watson]] writes: "The problem cannot be resolved by observing that the alleged contradictions are trivial ... [They] are far from trivial [and] there are very many of them, and they often relate to issues at the heart of the Christian faith and life."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, F., ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254 [[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Gale, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7876-4004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) replied to the writer [[Celsus]], a critic of Christianity, who had complained that some Christians had remodelled the [[Gospel]] to answer objections, agreeing that some had done so.&lt;ref name=Origen /&gt;  However, he stated that he did not believe the problem was widespread, nor did he approve of the practice, further stating that he believed that those making the alternations introduced "heresies opposed to the meaning of the doctrine of Jesus".&lt;ref name=Origen&gt;{{cite web|author=Origen|title = Contra Celsus, Book II, Chapter XXVII|url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html|accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a 5th-century attempt to explain away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, A. and Cavadini, JC., ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, p. 132 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that because there are those who would "rob [the Evangelists] of their credit as veracious historians", "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other."&lt;ref&gt;

St. Augustine of Hippo, in ''The Harmony Of The Gospels (Extended Annotated Edition)'', Jazzybee Verlag, 2012, Chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas more modern apologists, such as [[Gleason Archer]], in producing a book that provides explanations for many Bible difficulties, writes: "Be fully persuaded in your own mind that an adequate explanation exists, even though you have not yet found it."&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those who accept that there are inconsistencies, scholars such as [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the [[infancy narrative]]s of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

As a further example, the "[[Markan Appendix]]" "is universally accepted to have not been written by the author",&lt;ref&gt;Nave, DN., ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts'',BRILL, 2002 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mark 16:9-20 was added later so that the Gospel of Mark originally ended at [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscript tradition|Mark 16:8]].&lt;ref&gt;The role and function of repentance in Luke-Acts, by Guy D.

[[Historical-grammatical method|Grammatico-historical]] [[exegesis]] is determining the meaning of scripture by understanding the author's environment outside the Bible, as well as the scripture itself.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt; [[R.T. France|R. T. France]] states this form of exegesis involves the "fullest possible use of linguistic, literary, historical, archaeological, and other data bearing on that author's environment".&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt;

France, regarding the "distinctive contribution" of each of the four gospels, commented, "In accepting that God intended his church to have four Gospels, not just one, Christians have also recognized that each has something different to say about Jesus. It is only after we have listened to each in its individuality that we can hope to gain the full richness which comes from the 'stereoscopic' vision of Jesus as seen through four different pairs of eyes!"&lt;ref name=France2&gt;France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[two-source hypothesis]] remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels: according to this, there are two sources, the Gospel of Mark and a lost, hypothetical sayings collection called [[Q Document|Q]] (''see also, [[Two-source hypothesis#Other hypotheses|other hypotheses]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, RL., ''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'',Kregel Academic, 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Two-source Hypothesis is not without [[Two-source hypothesis#Problems with the hypothesis|its problems]].

====Examples====
A wide variety of inconsistencies have been suggested both within the New Testament and between the New Testament and the Hebrew scriptures. These fall into a number of broad categories. The more prominent are identified and discussed below, with examples.

=====Gospels=====
{{see also|Historical reliability of the Gospels|Gospel harmony}}
Internal consistency within the [[synoptic gospels]] has been analysed by many scholars. A well-known example is the nativity narratives found in the Gospel of Matthew ({{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1-6|NASB}}) and the Gospel of Luke ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:32-34|NASB}}). Each gives a [[genealogy of Jesus]], but the names, and even the number of generations, differ between the two. &lt;!--refs should not be needed because it's wikilinked!--&gt;Apologists have suggested that the differences are the result of two different lineages, Matthew's from King David's son, Solomon, to Jacob, father of Joseph, and Luke's from King David's other son, Nathan, to [[Heli (Bible)|Heli]], father of Mary and father-in-law of Joseph.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Tony. [http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html "Is there a Contradiction in the Genealogies of Luke and Matthew?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001045/http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html |date=2012-11-14 }} Created 2/2/95 / Last Modified 24 January 2000. Accessed 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scholar [[Geza Vermes]] points out that Luke makes no mention of Mary, and questions what purpose a maternal genealogy would serve in a Jewish setting.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', (Penguin, 2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] pointed out another conflict, between {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}("[[You're either with us, or against us|He who is not with Me is against Me]]; and he who does not gather with Me scatters") and {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}("For he who is not against us [''you''] is for us [''you'']"). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality".  He argued that both are necessary and that "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true."&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer&gt;[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], "''Ethics''", p. 60–61, Touchstone; (September 1, 1995, reprint of his 1943 book) {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.A. Carson]] commented similarly, adding he thought there are two different contexts where {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Carson, Commentary on Matthew, Expositor's Bible Commentary CDROM, [[Zondervan]], 1989–97&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;See the commentaries by [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/gospels.viii.xiii.html?scrBook=Mark&amp;scrCh=9-9&amp;scrV=40-40#viii.xiii-p0.1 McGarvey] on Mk 9:40, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/johnson_bw/pnt.pnt0112.html Johnson] on Mt 12:30, and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.xi.i.xiv.html?scrBook=Matt&amp;scrCh=12-12&amp;scrV=30-30#xi.i.xiv-p55.1 Brown] on Lk 11:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern New Testament scholarship tends to view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved in two different forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present a point of view that expresses the needs of the Christian community at the time.&lt;ref name=Culpepper&gt;R. Alan Culpepper, John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend, Continuum International Publishing (2000), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out [[exorcisms]] in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a [[Parable of the strong man|story about a strong man]]; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic,&lt;ref name=Culpepper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian H. Henderson, ''Jesus, Rhetoric and Law'', Brill (1996), pp. 333–334; William David Davies, Dale C. Allison, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'', Continuum International Publishing (2004), pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; see also the [[Jesus Seminar]].

Barton and Muddiman cite inconsistencies between the gospel writers about what happened at Christ's tomb. They note that "In Mk 16:1 there are three women at the tomb, in Mt 28:1 two, and in Lk 23:55-24:10 more than three. In Mark and Luke they come with spices to anoint Jesus, but in the Fourth Gospel this has already been done.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond E. Brown]] notes the apparent disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting the words of Jesus concerning his prediction of the destruction of the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the [[Wailing Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, RE., ''An Introduction to New Testament Christology'', Paulist Press, 1994, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ehrman, a more important difference among the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became human is only claimed in the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Ehrmanr&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus, Interrupted, Harper Collins Publishing (2009), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Douglad McCready, ''He Came Down from Heaven: The Preexistence of Christ And the Christian Faith.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Gathercole]], ''The Preexistent Son: Recovering the Christologies of Matthew, Mark and Luke.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acts of the Apostles=====
{{Main article|Conversion of Paul}}
{{See also|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}
In the "''Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties''", [[Gleason Archer|Archer]] examines two verses in Acts describing the [[Conversion of Paul]] which are sometimes perceived as a contradiction:&lt;ref name=ArcherBD&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The men who travelled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one''" {{bibleverse|Acts|9:7|NASB}}
:"''And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me''" {{bibleverse|Acts|22:9|NASB}}
Archer claims that the original Greek shows "there is no real contradiction between these two statements" because "Greek makes a distinction between hearing a sound as a noise (in which case the object to the verb "to hear" takes the genitive case) and hearing a voice as a thought-conveying message (in which case it takes the accusative)" and "in neither account is it stated that his companions ever heard that Voice in the accusative case".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;  Archer points to similar circumstances where "the crowd who heard the sound of the Father talking to the Son in John 12:28 ... perceived it only as thunder".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;

{{bibleverse|Acts|17:15-16}} is another troublesome part:

:"''So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.''"

The verse appear to place Jacob's burial in [[Shechem]], contradicting verses in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] which places the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] tomb in [[Hebron]]. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] writes "the text now stands, it is an evident error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblehub.com/commentaries/acts/7-15.htm|title=Acts 7:15 Commentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gospel and Acts=====
{{See also|Judas Iscariot}}
In {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:3-8|NASB}}, Judas returns the bribe Christians believe he had immorally accepted for handing over Jesus, throwing the money into the temple before hanging himself. The temple priests, unwilling to return the defiled money to the treasury,&lt;ref&gt;"It was not lawful to take into the Temple-treasury, for the purchase of sacred things, money that had been unlawfully gained." [[Alfred Edersheim]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; used it instead to buy a field known as the Potter's Field, as a plot in which to bury strangers. In {{bibleverse|Acts|1:18|NASB}}, on the other hand, Judas, having not committed suicide out of guilt, used the bribe money to buy the field himself, and his death in the field is attributed thus: "falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."

[[Raymond E. Brown]] points to the obvious contradiction: "Luke's account of the death of Judas in Acts 1:18 is scarcely reconcilable with Matt 27:3-10."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel harmony|Harmonization]] of the two accounts has been tried since ancient times&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Alfred Edersheim]] concluded, "there is no real divergence". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;  and occasionally still today.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr C Gempt suggests: "The details that seem at variance can be reconciled...after refusing the money the priests bought the field in Judas' name..and it was there that he hanged himself." His body was no longer hanging by the time it was discovered, but had fallen ... to the ground where it had split open.'Inter-Varsity Press New Bible Commentary 21st Century edition p1071&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars tend to find these unconvincing,&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Talbert, ''Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary'', Smyth &amp; Helwys (2005) p. 15. {{ISBN|1-57312-277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out, for instance, the absence of any indication of suicide in the story in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Mikeal C. Parsons, ''Acts'' (Baker Academic, 2008) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Epistles=====
{{Main article|Antinomianism}}
The [[Tübingen school]] of historians founded by [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F. C. Baur]] believes that in [[Early Christianity]], there was conflict between [[Pauline Christianity]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]] led by [[James the Just]], [[Simon Peter]], and [[John the Apostle]], the so-called "[[Jewish Christians]]" or "Pillars of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Less]: "Then we lose sight of James till St. Paul, three years after his conversion (A.D. 37), went up to Jerusalem. ... On the same occasion, the "pillars" of the Church, James, Peter, and John "gave to me (Paul) and Barnabas the [[Right hand of Christian fellowship|right hands of fellowship]]; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision" (Galatians 2:9)."&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed that the [[gentiles]] and Jewish Christians were no longer obligated to keep the Mosaic law ({{bibleref2|Gal|2:21}}). The Jewish Christians disagreed, believing that everyone, including the gentiles, must keep the Mosaic law. In {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:14}}, part of the "[[Incident at Antioch]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers] see section titled: "THE INCIDENT AT ANTIOCH"&lt;/ref&gt; Paul publicly rebuked Peter for [[judaize|judaizing]].

[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] claims several times that believers are saved by [[Divine grace]], and that believers are therefore ''"not under law, but under [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rom|6:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the ''"whole law"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''"a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone"'', and that ''"faith without works is dead"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants, with their belief in [[Sola Fide|salvation by faith alone]], have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. [[Martin Luther]], for example, asserted that the [[Epistle of James]] might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its canonicity - see [[Antilegomena]]).

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe that Paul and James do not contradict each other but speak about different questions.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Douglas J. Moo]] writes that ''"if a sinner can get into relationship with God only by faith (Paul), the ultimate validation of that relationship takes into account the works that true faith must inevitably produce (James)."''Douglas J. Moo, ''The Letter of James'', Erdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 141 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQJgtkaIUTIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+letter+of+james+douglas+j.+moo#PPA141,M1 The Letter of James]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that the perspective of Paul is different from, and complementary to, that of James - ''"When Paul claims that one is justified by faith alone, apart from works, he is referring to works that precede salvation. Conversely, when James insists on works as necessary to justification, he has in view works that follow and validate salvation."''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Bruce Compton: [http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1997/Jas2.pdf James 2:21-24 and the justification of Abraham, p. 44] - many scholars are referred to in the footnotes!&lt;/ref&gt; Paul states in various passages that works have to follow faith ({{bibleref2|Titus|2:11-12}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:10}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|6:13}}, {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:13}}, etc.).

In [[I Corinthians]]: "Inconsistencies have been found within later chapters, for instance between an apparently softer stance on sacrificial food in 8:1-13 and 10:22-11:1, and a harder line in 10:1-22."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the letter "seems to place a total ban on women's speech in church, which is strangely inconsistent with Paul's permission in 11:2-16 that (veiled) women could pray and prophesy."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Old Testament versus New Testament=====
{{Main article|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Christianity and Judaism|New Covenant|Antinomianism|Ethics in the Bible}}
In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian [[Marcion]] composed a work (now lost) entitled ''Antithesis''. In the Antithesis, [[Marcion]] set out in detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcionite-scripture.info/CB-The-Antithesis.pdf The Antithesis], Dr. Carroll Bierbower&lt;/ref&gt; The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was "[[an eye for an eye]]", but [[Matthew 5:39|Jesus set this precept aside]]. Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 "''I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things''. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that "''a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit''" and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, [[Elisha]] had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, "''Let the little children come to me''". [[Joshua]] had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] quoted Jesus as commanding "''Let not the sun go down on your wrath''"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, [[divorce]] was permitted and so was [[polygamy]]; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. [[Moses]] enforced the [[Jewish Sabbath]] and [[Jewish Law]]; Jesus has [[Christian liberty|de-institutionalised]] both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example,  God commanded that no work should be done on the Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]]. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiX5d09931UC&amp;pg=PA92 The canon of the New Testament: its origin, development, and significance], [[Bruce Manning Metzger]], p. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The early church, [[W. H. C. Frend]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God, [[Adolf Von Harnack]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian view is that [[Jesus]] mediates a [[New Covenant]] relationship between God and his followers and [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abolished the Mosaic Laws]], according to the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:15-18}}; {{bibleverse||Gal|3:23-25}}; {{bibleverse|2|Cor|3:7-17}}; {{bibleverse||Eph|2:15}}; {{bibleverse||Heb|8:13}}, {{bibleverse||Rom|7:6}} etc.) From a [[Jewish]] perspective however, the [[Torah]] was given to the Jewish people and [[B'nei Noah]] as an eternal covenant (for example {{bibleverse||Exod|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse||Exod|12:14-17}}, {{bibleverse||Mal|3:6-7}}) and will never be replaced or added to (for example {{bibleverse||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|13:1|HE}}). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of attempts to harmonize biblical statements that the biblical law is eternal ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod|12:14-17}}) with New Testament statements that suggest that it [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|does not now apply at all]], or at least [[Cafeteria Christianity|does not fully apply]]. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of [[Paul the Apostle#Relationship with Judaism|Paul and the Law]] is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, ed., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, see [[New Perspective on Paul]], [[Pauline Christianity]]); hence the various views.

'''Dr Kim Sloan''' is a Canadian [[art historian]].

==Career==
Sloan worked for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1986 where she curated an exhibition on [[Alexander Cozens]] from November 1986-January 1987. The exhibition then traveled to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] with additional works by his son [[John Robert Cozens]] and was on display January–March 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderjohnrob00sloa|title=Alexander and John Robert Cozens : the poetry of landscape|last=Sloan|first=Kim|last2=Art Gallery of Ontario|last3=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=1986|publisher=New Haven : Published in association with the Art Gallery of Ontario by Yale University Press|others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Sloan became the curator of British Drawings and Watercolours before 1880 at the [[British Museum]]. While at the [[British Museum]], Sloan has worked primarily on [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] and his collections at the [[British Museum]], the watercolours of [[J. M. W. Turner]], and the [[Hans Sloane]] collections. From 2000, Sloan was the lead curator creating the new Enlightenment Gallery at the [[British Museum]], which presents the history of the collection in the [[King's Library]] after the library collection moved to the [[British Library]]. The new gallery opened in 2003 and Sloan maintains curatorial responsibility for the Enlightenment Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COOTE|first=JEREMY|date=2007|title=Review of Enlightenment: Discovering the World in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=40793847|journal=Journal of Museum Ethnography|issue=19|pages=135–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wissenschaftliche-sammlungen.de/de/termine/kim-sloan-turning-kings-library-enlightenment-gallery-thirteen-years|title=Kim Sloan: "Turning the King's Library into the Enlightenment Gallery - thirteen years on" · Koordinierungsstelle wissenschaftliche Sammlungen|website=wissenschaftliche-sammlungen.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 2007 - January 2008, Sloan was the Leverhulme Fellow at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/learn-more-research|title=Research programmes at the Gallery - National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''link budget''' is an accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a [[telecommunication]] system. It accounts for the attenuation of 
the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the [[antenna gain]]s and [[feedline]] and other losses. Randomly varying channel gains such as [[fading]] are taken into account by adding some margin depending on the anticipated severity of its effects.  The amount of margin required can be reduced by the use of mitigating techniques such as [[antenna diversity]] or [[frequency hopping]].

A simple link budget equation looks like this:

:Received Power ([[decibel|dB]]) = Transmitted Power (dB) + Gains (dB) − Losses (dB)

Note that [[decibels]] are logarithmic measurements, so adding decibels is equivalent to multiplying the actual numeric ratios.

==In radio systems==
For a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] [[radio]] system, the primary source of loss is the decrease of the signal power due to uniform propagation, proportional to the inverse square of the distance (geometric spreading).

* Transmitting antennas are for the most part neither isotropic (an imaginary class of antenna with uniform radiation in 3 dimensions) nor omnidirectional (a real class of antenna with uniform radiation in 2 dimensions).
* The use of omnidirectional antennas is rare in telecommunication systems, so almost every link budget equation must consider antenna gain.
* Transmitting antennas typically concentrate the signal power in a favoured direction, normally that in which the receiving antenna is placed.
* Transmitter power is effectively increased (in the direction of highest antenna gain). This systemic gain is expressed by including the antenna gain in the link budget.
* The receiving antenna is also typically directional, and when properly oriented collects more power than an isotropic antenna would; as a consequence, the receiving antenna gain (in decibels from isotropic, dBi) adds to the received power.
* The antenna gains (transmitting or receiving) are scaled by the wavelength of the radiation in question. This step may not be required if adequate systemic link budgets are achieved.

===Simplifications needed===
Often link budget equations are messy and complex, so standard practices have evolved to simplify the [[Friis transmission equation]] into the link budget equation.  It includes the transmit and receive antenna gain, the [[Free-space path loss|free space path loss]] and additional losses and gains, assuming line of sight between the transmitter and receiver.

* The wavelength (or frequency) term is part of the free space loss part of the link budget.
* The distance term is also considered in the free space loss.

===Transmission line and polarization loss===
In practical situations (Deep Space Telecommunications, Weak signal DXing etc. ...) other sources of signal loss must also be accounted for
* The transmitting and receiving antennas may be partially cross-polarized.
* The cabling between the radios and antennas may introduce significant additional loss.
* [[Fresnel zone]] losses due to a partially obstructed line of sight path.
* [[Doppler shift]] induced signal power losses in the receiver.

===Endgame===
If the estimated received power is sufficiently large (typically relative to the  [[Sensitivity (electronics)|receiver sensitivity]]), which may be dependent on the communications protocol in use, the link will be useful for sending data.  The amount by which the received power exceeds receiver sensitivity is called the [[Fade margin|link margin]].

=== Equation ===
A link budget equation including all these effects, expressed logarithmically, might look like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
  P_{RX} = P_{TX} + G_{TX} - L_{TX} - L_{FS} - L_M + G_{RX} - L_{RX} \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = received power (dBm)
:&lt;math&gt;P_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter output power (dBm) 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter [[antenna gain]] (dBi)
:&lt;math&gt;L_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter losses (coax, connectors...) (dB) 
:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; = [[path loss]], usually [[free space loss]] (dB)
:&lt;math&gt;L_M&lt;/math&gt;  = miscellaneous losses ([[fading]] margin, body loss, polarization mismatch, other losses...) (dB)
:&lt;math&gt;G_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = receiver [[antenna gain]] (dBi)
:&lt;math&gt;L_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = receiver losses (coax, connectors...)  (dB)

The loss due to propagation between the transmitting and receiving antennas, often called the path loss, can be written in dimensionless form by normalizing the distance to the wavelength:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}\text{(dB)}=20\log_{10}\left(4\pi{\text{distance}\over\text{wavelength}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where distance and wavelength are in the same units)

When substituted into the link budget equation above, the result is the logarithmic form of the [[Friis transmission equation]].

In some cases, it is convenient to consider the loss due to distance and wavelength separately, but in that case, it is important to keep track of which units are being used, as each choice involves a differing constant offset.  Some examples are provided below.

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) =   32.45 dB + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(km)] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050901001655/http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~jones/es151/prop_models/propagation.html]

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) = - 27.55 dB + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(m)]

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) =   36.6 dB  + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(miles)]

These alternative forms can be derived by substituting wavelength with the ratio of propagation velocity (c, approximately 3×10^8&amp;nbsp;m/s) divided by frequency, and by inserting the proper conversion factors between km or miles and meters, and between MHz and (1/sec).

==Non-line-of-sight radio==
Because of building obstructions such as walls and ceilings, propagation losses indoors can be significantly higher. This occurs because of a combination of attenuation by walls and ceilings, and blockage due to equipment, furniture, and even people.

* For example, a “2 x 4” wood stud wall with [[drywall]] on both sides results in about 6&amp;nbsp;dB loss per wall.
* Older buildings may have even greater internal losses than new buildings due to materials and line of sight issues.

Experience has shown that line-of-sight propagation holds only for about the first 3 meters. Beyond 3 meters propagation losses indoors can increase at up to 30&amp;nbsp;dB per 30 meters in dense office environments.

This is a good “rule-of-thumb”, in that it is conservative (it overstates path loss in most cases). Actual propagation losses may vary significantly depending on
building construction and layout.

The attenuation of the signal is highly dependent on the frequency of the signal.

== In waveguides and cables ==
Guided media such as coaxial and twisted pair electrical cable, radio frequency waveguide and optical fiber have losses that are exponential with distance.

The [[path loss]] will be in terms of dB per unit distance.

This means that there is always a crossover  distance beyond which the loss in a guided medium will exceed that of a line-of-sight path of the same
length.

Long distance [[fiber-optic communication]] became practical only with the development of ultra-transparent glass fibers. A typical path loss for
[[single mode fiber]] is 0.2&amp;nbsp;dB/km, 
[http://www.corningcablesystems.com/web/library/litindex.nsf/$ALL/EVO-412-EN/$FILE/EVO-412-EN.pdf]
far lower than any other guided medium.

== Examples ==

=== Earth–Moon–Earth communications ===
Link budgets are important in [[EME (communications)|Earth–Moon–Earth communications]]. As the [[albedo]] of the Moon is very low (maximally 12% but usually closer to 7%), and the [[path loss]] over the [[1 E8 m|770,000 kilometre]] return distance is extreme (around 250 to 310 [[Decibel|dB]] depending on VHF-UHF band used, [[modulation]] format and [[Doppler shift]] effects), high power (more than 100 watts) and [[high-gain antenna]]s (more than 20&amp;nbsp;dB) must be used. 
* In practice, this limits the use of this technique to the spectrum at [[VHF]] and above.
* The Moon must be above the horizon in order for EME communications to be possible.

=== Voyager Program ===
The [[Voyager Program]] spacecraft have the highest known path loss (-308 dB as of 2002&lt;ref name=descanso&gt;
{{cite web|author=JPL Deep Space Communications and Navigation Systems |url=https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_ed.pdf |title=Voyager Telecommunications |publisher=descanso.jpl.nasa.gov|date=March 2002 |page=26|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and lowest link budgets of any telecommunications circuit. The [[Deep Space Network]] has been able to maintain the link at a higher than expected bitrate through a series of improvements, such as increasing the antenna size from 64m to 70m for a 1.2 dB gain, and upgrading to low noise electronics for a 0.5 dB gain in 2000/2001. During the Neptune flyby, in addition to the 70-m antenna, two 34-m antennas and twenty-seven 25-m antennas were used to increase the gain by 5.6 dB, providing additional link margin to be used for a 4x increase in bitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JPL Deep Space Communications and Navigation Systems |url=https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_ed.pdf |title=Voyager Telecommunications |publisher=descanso.jpl.nasa.gov|date=March 2002 |page=35|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a philanthropic doctrine|the offshoot of GiveWell|Open Philanthropy Project}}

'''Open Philanthropy''' is the [[doctrine]] which holds that the programming, operations, governance, effectiveness, and efficiency of nonprofit organizations should be open and visible by the public, donors, and especially, stakeholders in those nonprofits.

Among recent developments is the theory of [[open source governance]] which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[free software movement]] to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable interested citizens to get more directly involved in the legislative process.

The [[Effective altruism]] movement is a prominent proponent of analyzing, in a rubric with other criteria, the transparency of nonprofit organizations. The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] - a joint collaboration between [[GiveWell]], a charity navigator, and [[Good Ventures]], co-founded by a Facebook co-founder - "envision a world in which philanthropists increasingly document and share their research, reasoning, results and mistakes to help each other learn more quickly and serve the world more effectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/8/27/heres-what-philanthropy-looks-like-when-millennials-from-tec.html|title = Here's What Philanthropy Looks Like When Millennials From Tech and Finance Get Together|last = Moses|first = Sue-Lynn|date = 27 August 2014|accessdate = 4 April 2015|publisher = ''Inside Philanthropy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 2007 a variety of bloggers and writers, including Mark Surman,&lt;ref&gt;Surman, M., "Open, Philanthropy and a [[theory of change]]," commonspace, 2008 http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/open-philanthropy-and-a-theory-of-change/&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed the concept of "Open Philanthropy".  Few of these early efforts seemed to get much traction with stakeholders or nonprofit leaders. Then early in 2010,  Lucy Bernholz&lt;ref&gt;Bernholz, L., "Open Philanthropy: A Modest Manifesto," California Voices, 2010, http://california.newamerica.net/blogposts/2010/open_philhi am A you you are very good boyanthropy_a_modest_manifesto-29189&lt;/ref&gt; again surfaced the  concept for how nonprofits should follow the conventions of [[Open Source]] and [[Open Government]] initiatives.

==Content==
The guiding principles of compliant organizations include:

===Organizational Efficiency===
The plans, budgets, expenses, and programming of an organization shall be designed to ensure organizational focus on the mission of the organization. The majority of funds spent are in support of programs and services. Administrative and fundraising costs are kept within reasonable limits with a goal of more than 75 percent of funds allocated to program and outreach expenses.

===Program Efficiency===
Organizations shall have a documented methodology to measure and accurately report programmatic achievements, and where appropriate, the actual cost per beneficiary for program services. Additionally, these efforts shall account, and if necessary discount, for program achievements that are accomplished through and with other organizations. Program costs shall be managed to be as reasonable as possible, without sacrificing services, quality, and long-term sustainability of services.

===Organizational Effectiveness===
Programming is designed to be both sustainable and scalable using models other organizations can emulate and adopt or proving new concepts.  Fundraising efforts match anticipated programming needs.  Program efforts demonstrate high numbers of beneficiaries served with programs, which are sustainable for years and decades. Post-program monitoring and research designed to test impact, value, sustainability, and scalability of solutions. Measures of success are meaningful, accurate, and complete.

===Governance, Controls and Compliance===
Organization has documented strategic, fiscal, and annual plans and processes that are shared with appropriate stakeholders. Ongoing management review of key deliverables with risks identified and disaggregated by type. Mitigation strategies and processes incorporate controls, accountabilities, monitoring, and reporting. There shall be a clear organizational tone regarding ethical behavior in all the activities of the organization. Proactively explain actions and material decisions to stakeholders, including government, donors, beneficiaries, and the public at large.

===Shared lessons and content===
As the organization develops, implements, tests, and then refines procedures and processes, it shares those lessons in a non-competitive fashion with other organizations that might benefit from past successes. In regard to content, the organization will strive to collect, process, and share media assets such as video, still imagery, and audio in a manner that allows for release under [[creative commons]], no commercial use, with attribution licensing terms. Where permissible and valuable, make data interoperable and release intellectual property under [[open source]] creative commons licensing terms.

===Reporting and Transparency===
Organizations shall publish and make conveniently available important data about the organization, its staffing, resources, and governance. Reporting shall be in a format convenient for stakeholders and can include printed and digital reports, audio programming or real-time online systems. All reports shall be published on a timely basis and in particular financial data, including filed tax returns, shall be publicly available within 30 days of necessary audits. Organizations shall use best efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information released and shall promptly correct inaccuracies or incorrect materials.

===Practical Limitations===
Within the scope of Open Philanthropy there are practical limitations to the extent all materials shall be open and visible by the public.  Materials whose release would be prohibited by law, or that may compromise the corporate or personal safety of others are exempt. Those items with contractual privacy or licensing arrangements do not require disclosure. Organizations shall not disclose information that compromises the integrity of others, and/or organizational processes and policies. Only to the extent as explicitly permitted, donor information shall be exempt.  In compliance with trademark law, trade names and marks are exempt from reuse without attribution.

'''Refund to Savings''' (R2S) is an innovative, rigorously designed and scalable program intended to help low-income households build savings and increase financial security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx Refund to Savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204204502/http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx |date=2013-02-04 }}. Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a collaboration between the [[Center for Social Development]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Duke University]], and [[Intuit|Intuit Inc]]. R2S is the largest savings experiment conducted in the United States to date. This initiative builds on Intuit’s [[TurboTax]] Free File Alliance Online product, available free to lower-income taxpayers, to reach thousands of households.

The goal of the initiative is to design and test a low-touch, scalable intervention that can transform the tax-refund windfall into savings to improve financial security. The intervention builds on existing infrastructure and integrates with normal financial behavior, so it can quickly and inexpensively be expanded to reach millions of American households.

==Key Researchers and Partners==

The experiment was developed by economics professors [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and  [[Dan Ariely]] at [[Duke University]] and uses [[Intuit Inc|Intuit's]] TurboTax tax preparation software.

==Background==

The moment people are notified about their tax refund is a golden opportunity to divert money into short- and long-term savings. The participant just learned they will be receiving money, the money feels like a windfall (outside of their normal income pattern) and they do not yet have the money in hand.

The R2S initiative capitalizes on this opportunity. The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. For example, would mentioning the names of the taxpayer’s children increases the desire to divert money? Or would providing taxpayers a sense 
of common behavior among their peers motivate increased debt clearing?

The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. The prompts are informed by behavioral economics principles and have been shown in prior research to significantly increase savings intention in lower-income taxpayers. The variation in the prompts tests the influence of particular motivations on financial decision-making, compared with an unprompted control group. The variation in defaults tests the effect of defaults and of anchoring on savings behavior.

==Research Agenda==

The R2S initiative involves collecting three streams of data to evaluate the impact of the intervention and inform the design of future innovations to build savings, including the Intention Survey, In-Product Saving Offer, and Household Financial Survey.

===Intention Survey===

The Intention Survey is cross-sectional and designed to elicit information about possible behaviors and responses to behavioral economics-inspired prompts. It also gauges ownership of financial products (e.g., checking account, savings bond) and interest in using or opening these products at tax time. Findings from the Intention Survey contributed to the development of the In-Product Saving Offer and the Household Financial Survey. In 2012, 4,087 Intuit customers responded to the Intention Survey.

===In-Product Saving Offer===
The In-Product Saving Offer is the largest saving experiment ever undertaken in the U.S. TurboTax Freedom Edition users with refunds are assigned randomly to a treatment condition or control group. The control group uses the regular TurboTax program. The treatment group uses a version of the program in which they receive a prompt and a saving opportunity designed to increase saving. Data generated by program use and refund allocation behavior will be evaluated to determine whether the prompts, saving opportunity, or both increased saving levels compared to the control groups. In 2012, 150,000 people were included in the study, and about 1 million tax filers are expected to be included in 2013.

===Household Financial Survey===
The Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a longitudinal cohort study designed to determine the impact of tax-time saving and examine the effects of supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for [[precautionary savings]]) factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved in the absence of the intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.

==Impact==
Ultimately, R2S has numerous implications for ongoing policy discussions at state and federal levels. First, the findings will show whether (a) the use of behavioral economics-inspired interventions can increase saving at tax time and (b) saving-promotion efforts yield increased financial security and improved household balance sheets. Second, the project could provide evidence on the effect of supply- and demand-side constraints to saving and thus inform policy discussions regarding financial access, financial knowledge, and consumer protection. Third, the design and operation of the R2S initiative may be of interest to those considering policy innovations that leverage private-sector resources or incorporate public-private partnerships to achieve public policy objectives.

The team is also planning an ambitious program of dissemination to share R2S findings with a variety of audiences. Several policy, academic, and general interest publications will be produced detailing the impact of the experiment and findings from the research in each year. R2S also plans to host events to share interesting findings with the research and policy communities and with the general public.

'''Responsive web design''' ('''RWD''') is an approach to [[web design]] that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tafreshi|first1=Amir E.

===Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement===

"Mobile first", [[unobtrusive JavaScript]], and [[progressive enhancement]] are related concepts that predate RWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Responsive Web Design |date=July 23, 2012|url=http://www.webhostdesignpost.com/webdesign/whatisresponsivewebdesign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or [[media queries]], so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and PCs, rather than rely on [[Fault-tolerant system|graceful degradation]] to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobile First|date=November 3, 2009 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firtman"&gt;{{cite book|last= Firtman |first=Maximiliano |pages=512|url=http://www.mobilexweb.com/book|title=Programming the Mobile Web|date=July 30, 2011|isbn=978-0-596-80778-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement|date=February 3, 2009|url=http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113064723/https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|archivedate=November 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=February 2010 |pages=456 |url= http://filamentgroup.com/dwpe/ |title= Designing with Progressive Enhancement |accessdate= March 1, 2010 |isbn= 978-0-321-65888-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive enhancement based on browser, device, or feature detection===

Due to the high volume of usage of internet on mobile devices they can no longer be ignored. In 2014, for the first time more users accessed the internet from their mobile devices than desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allthewayupmedia.com/mobile-website/|title=Mobile Websites {{!}} All The Way Up Media|date=2016-10-31|work=All The Way Up Media|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, [[User agent#User agent identification|browser ("user agent") detection]] (also called "[[browser sniffing]]") and mobile device detection&lt;ref name="Firtman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDD"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|publisher = Smashing magazine |title=Server-Side Device Detection: History, Benefits And How-To|date=September 24, 2012 |url=http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/24/server-side-device-detection-history-benefits-how-to/}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two ways of deducing if certain HTML and CSS features are supported (as a basis for progressive enhancement)—however, these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database.

For more capable mobile phones and PCs, [[Comparison of JavaScript frameworks|JavaScript frameworks]] like [[Modernizr]], [[jQuery]], and [[jQuery Mobile]] that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features (or identify the device or user agent) are popular. [[Polyfill (programming)|Polyfill]]s can be used to add support for features—e.g. to support media queries (required for RWD), and enhance HTML5 support, on Internet Explorer. [[Feature detection (web development)|Feature detection]] also might not be completely reliable; some may report that a feature is available, when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is effectively nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |title=BlackBerry Torch: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305165051/http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |archive-date=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |title=Motorola Xoom: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213051238/http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |archive-date=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges, and other approaches==
Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges, and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobilism: jQuery Mobile|date=May 17, 2011|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RWD&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Rolling Up Our Responsive Sleeves|date=February 6, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Multi-Device Layout Patterns|date=March 14, 2012 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514}}&lt;/ref&gt; He&amp;nbsp;suggests that, compared with a simple RWD approach, device experience or RESS (responsive web design with server-side components) approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices.&lt;ref name=RESS&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Responsive Design ... or RESS|date=February 29, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=RESS: Responsive Design + Server Side Components |date=September 12, 2011 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andersen |first=Anders |title=Getting Started with RESS|date=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/getting-started-ress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Server-side "[[dynamic CSS]]" implementation of stylesheet languages like [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]] or Incentivated's MML can be part of such an approach by accessing a server based API which handles the device (typically mobile handset) differences in conjunction with a device capabilities database in order to improve usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.incentivated.com/blogdetail/Responsive-but-not-completely-mobile-optimised/ |title=Responsive but not completely mobile optimised &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Incentivated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RESS is more expensive to develop, requiring more than just client-side logic, and so tends to be reserved for organizations with larger budgets. Google recommends responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/ |title=Building Smartphone-Optimized Websites |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many publishers are starting to implement responsive designs, one ongoing challenge for RWD is that some [[Web banner|banner advertisements]] and videos are not fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Matthew|last2=Koren|first2=Etai|title=The state of responsive advertising: the publishers' perspective|date=April 30, 2012|publisher=.net Magazine|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/state-responsive-advertising-publishers-perspective-4126330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[search advertising]] and (banner) [[display advertising]] support specific device platform targeting and different advertisement size formats for desktop, smartphone, and basic mobile devices.

==History==
The first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was ''[[Audi]].com'' launched in late 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Kalbach, Jim (July 22, 2012). [https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/the-first-responsive-design-website-audi-circa-2002/ "The First Responsive Design Website: Audi (circa 2002)."] {{sps|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created by a team at [[razorfish (company)|razorfish]] consisting of Jürgen Spangl and Jim Kalbach (information architecture), Ken Olling (design), and Jan Hoffmann (interface development). Limited browser capabilities meant that for Internet Explorer, the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for Netscape, the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized.

Cameron Adams created a demonstration in 2004 that is still online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams|first1=Cameron|title=Resolution dependent layout: Varying layout according to browser width|url=http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/|website=The Man in Blue|date=September 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008, a number of related terms such as "flexible", "liquid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G146.html|title=G146: Using liquid layout|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fluid", and "elastic" were being used to describe layouts. CSS3 media queries were almost ready for prime time in late 2008/early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090423/|title=Media Queries|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outseller.net/2015s-professional-responsive-web-design-offer-businesses/|title=OutSeller Group - Organize, Optimize, Maximize|work=outseller.net|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RWD)&amp;mdash;and defined it to mean fluid grid/ flexible images/ media queries&amp;mdash;in a May 2010 article in ''[[A List Apart]]''.&lt;ref name=fluid_grid /&gt;&lt;!--ref name=EM /--&gt; He described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled ''Responsive Web Design''. Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by [[.net (magazine)|.net magazine]] after [[progressive enhancement]] at #1.

[[Mashable]] called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design.&lt;ref name="mashable_2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cashmore|first=Pete|title=Why 2013 Is the Year of Responsive Web Design|date=December 11, 2012|url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications due to its ability to house all of the code in a single website. Users and developers alike began realizing the benefits and importance of mobile-responsive designs as mobile use continued to rise. &lt;ref name="wesfed_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Wes|title=Why mobile websites are important|date=December 6, 2016|url=https://www.wesfed.com/blog/why-mobile-websites-are-important/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This realization of importance was confirmed when Google made their announcement that search engines were going to reward responsive websites with increased rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">In [[biology]], a '''reticulation''' of a [[single-access key|single-access identification key]] connects different branches of the identification tree to improve error tolerance and identification success.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, D. V. 1963. Some Aspects of the theory of dichotomous keys. New Phytologist, 62 (2): 144-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, R. W. &amp; Preece, D. A. 1977.

Reticulation and other methods of reducing the size of printed diagnostic keys. J. Gen. Microbiol. 98: 595-597.&lt;/ref&gt; In a reticulated key, multiple paths lead to the same result; the tree data structure thus changes from a simple tree to a [[directed acyclic graph]].

Two forms of reticulation can be distinguished: Terminal reticulation and inner reticulation. 
* In a terminal reticulation a single [[taxon]] or next-level-key is keyed out in several locations in the key. This type of reticulation is normally compatible with any printable presentation format of identification keys and normally does not require special precautions in software used for branching keys. 
* In an inner reticulation a couplet with further leads can be reached through more than one path. Depending on the software or printable presentation format, this may be more challenging. For the linked (= "parallel" or "bracketed") format, where each lead points to a numbered couplet, inner reticulations present no special challenge. However, for the nested (= "indented") presentation format, where all following couplets immediately follow their lead, a cross-connection to a different subtree in the key requires a special mechanism.

Reticulations generally improve the usability of a [[Dichotomous key|key]], but may also diminish the overall probability of correct identification averaged over all [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, D. V. 1963. Some Aspects of the theory of dichotomous keys. New Phytologist, 62 (2): 144-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rock shed''' is a [[civil engineering]] structure used in mountainous areas where [[landslide|rock slides and land slides]] create highway closure problems.

The '''SUNY-ESF Ranger School''' (formerly the '''New York State Ranger School'''), on the east branch of the [[Oswegatchie River]] near [[Wanakena, New York]], offers [[Associate degree#United States|A.A.S.]] degrees in forest and natural resources management. Established in 1912, the school is affiliated with the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] (SUNY-ESF). The Ranger School commemorated its centennial in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=1854 "Ranger School Celebrates Its 100th," SUNY-ESF, August 6, 2012.] Accessed: August 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The Ranger School is situated in the northwestern part of the [[Adirondack Park]], on the east branch of the scenic Oswegatchie River, which flows into [[Cranberry Lake]]. The campus is about {{convert|65|mi|km}} from [[Watertown, New York]] and {{convert|35|mi|km}} from [[Tupper Lake (village), New York|Tupper Lake]].

==History==
The New York State Ranger School was founded in 1912, under the administration of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]], to train [[forest ranger]]s and other personnel for the still-young Adirondack Park.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Eugene S. Whitmore, the Ranger School's first graduate, completed his studies the same year that school was founded, in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3000 students have completed their degrees at the Ranger School since it opened.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Ranger School celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2012-13.&lt;ref name=wdt&gt;[http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120512/NEWS05/705129917 Ellen, Martha. 2012. "Ranger School marks its centennial year," ''Watertown Daily Times'', May 12.] Accessed: May 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
* Professor James F. Dubuar served as Director of the Ranger School for 37 years, from 1921-1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martallen.com/pdf/1996/july/07%2009%201996%20RANGER%20SCHOOL%20AND%20JAMES%20DUBUARS%20DEDICATION.pdf Allen, Mart. 1996. "Ranger School's a Testimony to James Dubuar's Dedication," July 9.] Accessed: June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties ===
* Shortly before its establishment, the school received a gift of {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} from the [[Rich Brothers Lumber Company]].&lt;ref name=rez&gt;Reznikoff, Charles, ed. 1957. ''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1923, Governor [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]], later to become President of the Board of Trustees of the New York State College of Forestry, signed an appropriation bill for the construction of the Ranger School's new building; the structure was dedicated in 1928. 
* The [[International Paper Company]] added to the school's properties with a gift of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, in 1929.&lt;ref name=rez /&gt;

==Today==
Today, the Ranger School is a unit of the SUNY-ESF. Michael Bridgen, Professor of Forest and Natural Resources Management, is director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/rangerschool/directory/ "Ranger School Directory,"] SUNY-ESF Ranger School. Accessed: July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After "spending a year at a college of their choice,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; students spend an academic year or summer at the residential school, studying [[forestry|forest technology]], [[surveying]], or environmental and [[natural resource management|natural resources conservation]], earning an [[Associate of Applied Science]] (A.A.S.) degree upon completion. Students can continue their studies at the main ESF campus, in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], to earn a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

In addition to classrooms, offices, dormitory and kitchen facilities, the school's properties also include the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}}, [[James F. Dubuar Memorial Forest]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/rangerschool/ SUNY-ESF: SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - The Ranger School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{semiotics}}
A '''sign relation''' is the basic construct in the theory of signs, also known as [[semiotics]], as developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

==Anthesis==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus, if a sunflower, in turning towards the sun, becomes by that very act fully capable, without further condition, of reproducing a sunflower which turns in precisely corresponding ways toward the sun, and of doing so with the same reproductive power, the sunflower would become a Representamen of the sun.  (C.S. Peirce, "Syllabus" (''c''. 1902), ''Collected Papers'', CP 2.274).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his picturesque illustration of a sign relation, along with his tracing of a corresponding sign process, or ''[[semiosis]]'', Peirce uses the technical term ''representamen'' for his concept of a sign, but the shorter word is precise enough, so long as one recognizes that its meaning in a particular theory of signs is given by a specific definition of what it means to be a sign.

==Definition==

One of Peirce's clearest and most complete definitions of a sign is one that he gives, not incidentally, in the context of defining "[[logic]]", and so it is informative to view it in that setting.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Logic will here be defined as ''formal semiotic''.  A definition of a sign will be given which no more refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place which a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time.  Namely, a sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''.  It is from this definition, together with a definition of "formal", that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic.  I also make a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic, and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my non-psychological conception of logic has ''virtually'' been quite generally held, though not generally recognized.  (C.S. Peirce, NEM 4, 20–21).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the general discussion of diverse theories of signs, the question frequently arises whether signhood is an absolute, essential, indelible, or ''[[ontology|ontological]]'' property of a thing, or whether it is a relational, interpretive, and mutable role that a thing can be said to have only within a particular context of relationships.

Peirce's definition of a ''sign'' defines it in relation to its ''object'' and its ''interpretant sign'', and thus it defines signhood in ''[[logic of relatives|relative terms]]'', by means of a predicate with three places.  In this definition, signhood is a role in a [[triadic relation]], a role that a thing bears or plays in a given context of relationships — it is not as an ''absolute'', ''non-relative'' property of a thing-in-itself, one that it possesses independently of all relationships to other things.

Some of the terms that Peirce uses in his definition of a sign may need to be elaborated for the contemporary reader.

* '''Correspondence'''.  From the way that Peirce uses this term throughout his work, it is clear that he means what he elsewhere calls a "triple correspondence", and thus this is just another way of referring to the whole triadic sign relation itself.  In particular, his use of this term should not be taken to imply a dyadic correspondence, like the kinds of "mirror image" correspondence between realities and representations that are bandied about in contemporary controversies about "[[correspondence theories of truth]]".
* '''Determination'''.  Peirce's concept of determination is broader in several directions than the sense of the word that refers to strictly deterministic causal-temporal processes.  First, and especially in this context, he is invoking a more general concept of determination, what is called a ''formal'' or ''informational'' determination, as in saying "two points determine a line", rather than the more special cases of causal and temporal determinisms.  Second, he characteristically allows for what is called ''determination in measure'', that is, an order of determinism that admits a full spectrum of more and less determined relationships.
* '''Non-psychological'''.  Peirce's "non-psychological conception of logic" must be distinguished from any variety of ''anti-psychologism''.  He was quite interested in matters of psychology and had much of import to say about them.  But logic and psychology operate on different planes of study even when they have occasion to view the same data, as logic is a ''[[normative science]]'' where psychology is a ''[[descriptive science]]'', and so they have very different aims, methods, and rationales.

==Signs and inquiry==
{{Main|Inquiry}}

There is a close relationship between the pragmatic theory of signs and the pragmatic theory of [[inquiry]].  In fact, the correspondence between the two studies exhibits so many congruences and parallels that it is often best to treat them as integral parts of one and the same subject.  In a very real sense, inquiry is the process by which sign relations come to be established and continue to evolve.  In other words, inquiry, "thinking" in its best sense, "is a term denoting the various ways in which things acquire significance" ([[John Dewey]]).  Thus, there is an active and intricate form of cooperation that needs to be appreciated and maintained between these converging modes of investigation.  Its proper character is best understood by realizing that the theory of inquiry is adapted to study the developmental aspects of sign relations, a subject which the theory of signs is specialized to treat from structural and comparative points of view.

==Examples of sign relations==

Because the examples to follow have been artificially constructed to be as simple as possible, their detailed elaboration can run the risk of trivializing the whole theory of sign relations.  Despite their simplicity, however, these examples have subtleties of their own, and their careful treatment will serve to illustrate many important issues in the general theory of signs.

Imagine a discussion between two people, Ann and Bob, and attend only to that aspect of their interpretive practice that involves the use of the following nouns and pronouns:  "Ann", "Bob", "I", "you".

The ''object domain'' of this discussion fragment is the set of two people {Ann, Bob}.  The ''syntactic domain'' or the ''sign system'' that is involved in their discussion is limited to the ''[[set (mathematics)|set]]'' of four signs {"Ann", "Bob", "I", "You"}.

In their discussion, Ann and Bob are not only the passive objects of nominative and accusative references but also the active interpreters of the language that they use.  The ''system of interpretation'' (SOI) associated with each language user can be represented in the form of an individual ''[[triadic relation|three-place relation]]'' called the ''sign relation'' of that interpreter.

Understood in terms of its ''[[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[extension (semantics)|extension]]'', a sign relation '''L''' is a ''[[subset]]'' of a ''[[cartesian product]]'' '''O''' × '''S''' × '''I'''.  Here, '''O''', '''S''', '''I''' are three sets that are known as the ''object domain'', the ''sign domain'', and the ''interpretant domain'', respectively, of the sign relation '''L'''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''O'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''S'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''I'''.

Broadly speaking, the three domains of a sign relation can be any sets whatsoever, but the kinds of sign relations that are typically contemplated in a computational setting are usually constrained to having '''I''' ⊆ '''S'''.  In this case, interpretants are just a special variety of signs, and this makes it convenient to lump signs and interpretants together into a single class called the ''syntactic domain''.   In the forthcoming examples, '''S''' and '''I''' are identical as sets, so the same elements manifest themselves in two different roles of the sign relations in question.  When it is necessary to refer to the whole set of objects and signs in the union of the domains '''O''', '''S''', '''I''' for a given sign relation '''L''', one may refer to this set as the ''world of '''L''''' and write '''W''' = '''W'''&lt;sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''O''' &lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY:  Code2000, 'Palatino Linotype', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande'"&gt;∪&lt;/span&gt; '''S''' &lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Code2000, 'Palatino Linotype', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande'"&gt;∪&lt;/span&gt; '''I'''.

To facilitate an interest in the abstract structures of sign relations, and to keep the notations as brief as possible as the examples become more complicated, it serves to introduce the following general notations:

:{| cellpadding="4"
| align="center" | '''O''' || = || Object Domain
|-
| align="center" | '''S''' || = || Sign Domain
|-
| align="center" | '''I''' || = || Interpretant Domain
|}

Introducing a few abbreviations for use in considering the present Example, we have the following data:

:{| cellpadding="4"
| align="center" | '''O'''
| =
| {Ann, Bob}
| =
| {A, B}
|-
| align="center" | '''S'''
| =
| {"Ann", "Bob", "I", "You"}
| =
| {"A", "B", "i", "u"}
|-
| align="center" | '''I'''
| =
| {"Ann", "Bob", "I", "You"}
| =
| {"A", "B", "i", "u"}
|}

In the present Example, '''S''' = '''I''' = Syntactic Domain.

The next two Tables give the sign relations associated with the interpreters A and B, respectively, putting them in the form of ''[[relational database]]s''.  Thus, the rows of each Table list the ordered triples of the form (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') that make up the corresponding sign relations, '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ '''O''' × '''S''' × '''I'''.  It is often tempting to use the same names for objects and for relations involving these objects, but it is best to avoid this in a first approach, taking up the issues that this practice raises after the less problematic features of these relations have been treated.

{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:60%"
|+ '''Sign Relation of Interpreter A'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:20%" | Object

! style="width:20%" | Interpretant
|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"''' || '''"i"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"i"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"i"''' || '''"i"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"u"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"u"''' || '''"u"'''
|}

{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:60%"
|+ '''Sign Relation of Interpreter B'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"

|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"u"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"u"''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"''' || '''"i"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"i"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"i"''' || '''"i"'''
|}

These Tables codify a rudimentary level of interpretive practice for the agents A and B, and provide a basis for formalizing the initial semantics that is appropriate to their common syntactic domain.  Each row of a Table names an object and two co-referent signs, making up an ordered triple of the form (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') that is called an ''elementary relation'', that is, one element of the relation's set-theoretic extension.

Already in this elementary context, there are several different meanings that might attach to the project of a ''formal semiotics'', or a formal theory of meaning for signs.  In the process of discussing these alternatives, it is useful to introduce a few terms that are occasionally used in the philosophy of language to point out the needed distinctions.

==Dyadic aspects of sign relations==

For an arbitrary triadic relation '''L''' ⊆ '''O''' × '''S''' × '''I''', whether it is a sign relation or not, there are six ''[[binary relation|dyadic relations]]'' that can be obtained by ''[[projection (set theory)|projecting]]'' '''L''' on one of the planes of the '''OSI'''-space '''O'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''S'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''I'''.  The six dyadic projections of a triadic relation '''L''' are defined and notated as follows:

:{| cellpadding="4"
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''o'', ''s'') ∈ '''O''' × '''S''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''i'' ∈ '''I''' }
|-
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''s'', ''o'') ∈ '''S''' × '''O''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''i'' ∈ '''I''' }
|-
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''i'', ''s'') ∈ '''I''' × '''S''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''o'' ∈ '''O''' }
|-
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''S''' × '''I''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''o'' ∈ '''O''' }
|-
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''o'', ''i'') ∈ '''O''' × '''I''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''s'' ∈ '''S''' }
|-
| '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;IO&lt;/sub&gt;
| =
| ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;IO&lt;/sub&gt;('''L''')
| =
| { (''i'', ''o'') ∈ '''I''' × '''O''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''s'' ∈ '''S''' }
|}

By way of unpacking the set-theoretic notation, here is what the first definition says in ordinary language.  The dyadic relation that results from the projection of '''L''' on the '''OS'''-plane '''O'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''S''' is written briefly as '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt; or written more fully as ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;('''L'''), and it is defined as the set of all ordered pairs (''o'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') in the cartesian product '''O'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''S''' for which there exists an ordered triple (''o'',&amp;nbsp;''s'',&amp;nbsp;''i'') in '''L''' for some interpretant ''i'' in the interpretant domain '''I'''.

In the case where '''L''' is a sign relation, which it becomes by satisfying one of the definitions of a sign relation, some of the dyadic aspects of '''L''' can be recognized as formalizing aspects of sign meaning that have received their share of attention from students of signs over the centuries, and thus they can be associated with  traditional concepts and terminology.  Of course, traditions may vary as to the precise formation and usage of such concepts and terms.  Other aspects of meaning have not received their fair share of attention, and thus remain anonymous on the contemporary scene of sign studies.

===Denotation===

One aspect of a sign's complete meaning is concerned with the reference that a sign has to its objects, which objects are collectively known as the ''denotation'' of the sign.  In the pragmatic theory of sign relations, denotative references fall within the projection of the sign relation on the plane that is spanned by its object domain and its sign domain.

The dyadic relation that makes up the ''denotative'', ''referential'', or ''semantic'' aspect or component of a sign relation '''L''' is notated as ''Den''('''L''').  Information about the denotative aspect of meaning is obtained from '''L''' by taking its projection on the object-sign plane, in other words, on the 2-dimensional space that is generated by the object domain '''O''' and the sign domain '''S'''.  This semantic component of a sign relation '''L''' is written in any one of the forms, '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;, ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;'''L''', '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'''L''', and it is defined as follows:

: ''Den''('''L''') = ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;'''L''' = { (''o'', ''s'') ∈ '''O''' × '''S''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''i'' ∈ '''I''' }.

Looking to the denotative aspects of '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, various rows of the Tables specify, for example, that A uses "i" to denote A and "u" to denote B, whereas B uses "i" to denote B and "u" to denote A.  All of these denotative references are summed up in the projections on the '''OS'''-plane, as shown in the following Tables:

{| align="center" style="width:90%"
|
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:90%"
|+  ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;('''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:50%" | Object
! style="width:50%" | Sign
|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"i"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"u"'''
|}
|
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:90%"
|+ ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;('''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:50%" | Object
! style="width:50%" | Sign
|-
| '''A''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''A''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''B''' || '''"i"'''
|}
|}

===Connotation===

Another aspect of meaning concerns the connection that a sign has to its interpretants within a given sign relation.  As before, this type of connection can be vacuous, singular, or plural in its collection of terminal points, and it can be formalized as the dyadic relation that is obtained as a planar projection of the triadic sign relation in question.

The connection that a sign makes to an interpretant is here referred to as its ''connotation''.  In the full theory of sign relations, this aspect of meaning includes the links that a sign has to affects, concepts, ideas, impressions, intentions, and the whole realm of an agent's mental states and allied activities, broadly encompassing intellectual associations, emotional impressions, motivational impulses, and real conduct.  Taken at the full, in the natural setting of semiotic phenomena, this complex system of references is unlikely ever to find itself mapped in much detail, much less completely formalized, but the tangible warp of its accumulated mass is commonly alluded to as the connotative import of language.

Formally speaking, however, the connotative aspect of meaning presents no additional difficulty.  For a given sign relation '''L''', the dyadic relation that constitutes the ''connotative aspect'' or ''connotative component'' of '''L''' is notated as ''Con''('''L''').

The connotative aspect of a sign relation '''L''' is given by its projection on the plane of signs and interpretants, and is thus defined as follows:

: ''Con''('''L''') = ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;'''L''' = { (''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''S''' × '''I''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''o'' ∈ '''O''' }.

All of these connotative references are summed up in the projections on the '''SI'''-plane, as shown in the following Tables:

{| align="center" style="width:90%"
|
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:90%"
|+ ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;('''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)

|}
|
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:90%"
|+ ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;('''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:50%" | Sign
! style="width:50%" | Interpretant
|-
| '''"A"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''"A"''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''"u"''' || '''"A"'''
|-
| '''"u"''' || '''"u"'''
|-
| '''"B"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''"B"''' || '''"i"'''
|-
| '''"i"''' || '''"B"'''
|-
| '''"i"''' || '''"i"'''
|}
|}

===Ennotation===

The aspect of a sign's meaning that arises from the dyadic relation of its objects to its interpretants has no standard name.  If an interpretant is considered to be a sign in its own right, then its independent reference to an object can be taken as belonging to another moment of denotation, but this neglects the mediational character of the whole transaction in which this occurs.  Denotation and connotation have to do with dyadic relations in which the sign plays an active role, but here we have to consider a dyadic relation between objects and interpretants that is mediated by the sign from an off-stage position, as it were.  As a relation between objects and interpretants that is mediated by a sign, this aspect of meaning may be referred to as the ''ennotation'' of a sign, and the dyadic relation that constitutes the ''ennotative aspect'' of a sign relation '''L''' may be notated as ''Enn''('''L''').

The ennotational component of meaning for a sign relation '''L''' is captured by its projection on the plane of the object and interpretant domains, and it is thus defined as follows:

: ''Enn''('''L''') = ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt;'''L''' = { (''o'', ''i'') ∈ '''O''' × '''I''' : (''o'', ''s'', ''i'') ∈ '''L''' for some ''s'' ∈ '''S''' }.

As it happens, the sign relations '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are fully symmetric with respect to exchanging signs and interpretants, so all of the data of ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is echoed unchanged in ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
and all of the data of ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is echoed unchanged in ''proj''&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Six ways of looking at a sign relation==

In the context of 3-adic relations in general, Peirce provides the following illustration of the six ''converses'' of a 3-adic relation, that is, the six differently ordered ways of stating what is logically the same 3-adic relation:

: So in a triadic fact, say, the example
{| align="center" cellspacing="8" style="width:72%"
| align="center" | ''A'' gives ''B'' to ''C''
|}
: we make no distinction in the ordinary logic of relations between the ''[[subject (grammar)|subject]] [[nominative]]'', the ''[[direct object]]'', and the ''[[indirect object]]''.  We say that the proposition has three ''logical subjects''.  We regard it as a mere affair of English grammar that there are six ways of expressing this:
{| align="center" cellspacing="8" style="width:72%"
| style="width:36%" | ''A'' gives ''B'' to ''C''
| style="width:36%" | ''A'' benefits ''C'' with ''B''
|-
| ''B'' enriches ''C'' at expense of ''A''
| ''C'' receives ''B'' from ''A''
|-
| ''C'' thanks ''A'' for ''B''
| ''B'' leaves ''A'' for ''C''
|}
: These six sentences express one and the same indivisible phenomenon. (C.S. Peirce, "The Categories Defended", MS 308 (1903), EP 2, 170-171).

Words spoken are symbols or signs (σύμβολα) of affections or impressions (παθήματα) of the soul (ψυχή);  written words are the signs of words spoken.  As writing, so also is speech not the same for all races of men.  But the mental affections themselves, of which these words are primarily signs ({{lang|grc|σημεῖα}}), are the same for the whole of mankind, as are also the objects (πράγματα) of which those affections are representations or likenesses, images, copies ({{lang|grc|ὁμοιώματα}}).

Logic will here be defined as ''formal semiotic''.  A definition of a sign will be given which no more refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place which a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time.  Namely, a sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''.  It is from this definition, together with a definition of "formal", that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic.  I also make a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic, and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my non-psychological conception of logic has ''virtually'' been quite generally held, though not generally recognized. (C.S. Peirce, "Application to the [[Carnegie Institution]]", L75 (1902), NEM 4, 20-21).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===SOI===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A ''Sign'' is anything which is related to a Second thing, its ''Object'', in respect to a Quality, in such a way as to bring a Third thing, its ''Interpretant'', into relation to the same Object, and that in such a way as to bring a Fourth into relation to that Object in the same form, ''ad infinitum''.  (CP 2.92; quoted in Fisch 1986: 274)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">The '''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''' ('''SAHGB''') is a [[United Kingdom]] [[learned society]] for people interested in the [[history of architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/about.html About US], ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain The Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021321/http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain |date=2008-12-06 }}, [[RIBApedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/a/OL5265410A Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain], [[Open Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Society exists to encourage interest in the history of architecture, to enable the exchange and discussion of ideas related to this. The Society has no official location and its activities cover the [[United Kingdom]]. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.

''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' is the main journal of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members.

== History ==

The foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by [[Turpin Bannister]] in discussion with [[Frank Jenkins (architect)|Frank Jenkins]], a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the [[University of Illinois]] in the [[United States]]. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American [[Society of Architectural Historians]] partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the [[York Institute of Architectural Study]].

'''Superposed order''' (also superimposed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superimposed orders|url=http://en.mimi.hu/architecture/superimposed_orders.html|publisher=en.mimi.hu|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one where successive storeys of a building have different orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superposed order|url=https://global.britannica.com/technology/superposed-order|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous ancient example of such an order is [[the Colosseum]] at Rome, which had no less than four storeys of superposed orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitham|first1=Robert|title=The Classical Orders of Architecture|date=May 12, 2014|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9781483278230|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superposition rules were  developed in ancient Greece and were also actively used in the architecture of ancient Rome. Later in the 19th century, the order was used in the architecture of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]].

==Composition==
The heaviest orders are at the bottom of a building, whilst the lightest come at the top. This rule means that the [[Doric order]] is a preferred order for the ground floor, the [[Ionic order]] is used for the middle storey, while the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or the [[Composite order]] is used for the top storey. The ground floor may also have [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Initially, the top story usually featured the Composite order, but, after [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published his treatise ''L’Idea dell’Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture'') (Venice, 1615), architects switched to the Corinthian order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СУПЕРПОЗИЦИЯ|url=http://www.rah.ru/science/glossary/detail.php?ID=19529&amp;sphrase_id=26073|website=[[The Russian Academy of Arts ]]|publisher=rah.ru|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superposed order allowed storeys without columns, but rearrangement of order styles was strictly forbidden.

In computer science, a [[simulation]] is a computation of the execution of some appropriately modelled state-transition system. Typically this process models the complete state of the system at individual points in a discrete linear time frame, computing each state sequentially from its predecessor. Models for computer programs or VLSI logic designs can be very easily simulated, as they often have an [[operational semantics]] which can be used directly for simulation.

'''Symbolic simulation''' is a form of simulation where many possible executions of a system are considered simultaneously. This is typically achieved by augmenting the domain over which the simulation takes place. A symbolic [[Variable (programming)|variable]] can be used in the simulation state representation in order to index multiple executions of the system. For each possible valuation of these variables, there is a concrete system state that is being indirectly simulated.

Because symbolic simulation can cover many system executions in a single simulation, it can greatly reduce the size of verification problems. Techniques such as [[symbolic trajectory evaluation]] (STE) and [[generalized symbolic trajectory evaluation]] (GSTE) are based on this idea of symbolic simulation.

The '''Université de Moncton''' (abbr. '''U de M''', transl. ''University of Moncton'') is a French-language university located in [[Edmundston]], [[Moncton]] and [[Shippagan]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada serving the [[Acadian]] community of [[Atlantic Canada]]. It is the only [[francophone]] university in New Brunswick and is one of only two such [[List of universities in Canada|universities]] in the [[Maritimes]], the other being the [[Université Sainte-Anne]] in [[Pointe-de-l'Église, Nova Scotia|Pointe-de-l'Église]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada. It is also the largest French-language university in Canada outside [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umoncton.ca/english/ About U de M]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded on 19 June 1963, the modern Université de Moncton is the result of the merger of three colleges: [[Collège Saint-Joseph]] ([[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], 1864), [[Collège du Sacré-Coeur (New Brunswick)|Collège du Sacré-Cœur]] ([[Caraquet]], 1899 then [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], 1915), and [[Collège Saint-Louis]] ([[Edmundston]], 1946).&lt;ref&gt;

The main campus at Moncton has eight faculties:
* Administration
* Arts and Social Sciences
* Education
* Engineering (includes Civil Engineering, [[Electrical Engineering]] and Mechanical Engineering)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cemf.ca/Engineering/UniversityList.htm Canadian Engineering Memorial Foundation – University List&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324083010/http://www.cemf.ca/Engineering/UniversityList.htm |date=24 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Graduate Studies
* Health Sciences and Community Services
* Sciences
* [[Université de Moncton École de droit|Law]]&lt;ref name="Université de Moncton"/&gt;

===Faculty of Law===
The [[Université de Moncton École de droit|University of Moncton's Faculty of Law]] is one of only two French-language [[common law]] schools in the world. (The [[University of Ottawa]] also offers a common law education in French.) The school was founded in 1978 in order to respond to the needs of francophone communities outside Quebec. As Quebec practices [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], there was a need to instruct francophone lawyers in common law to practice in other parts of Canada. The University of Ottawa law school teaches both common and civil law, as does McGill; thus the University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is the only exclusively French, exclusively common law school in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umoncton.ca/droit/Information__generale/Introduction.html |title=Université de Moncton, Campus de Moncton – Faculté de droit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014043507/http://www.umoncton.ca/droit/Information__generale/Introduction.html |archive-date=14 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U de M offers both the [[Juris Doctor|JD]] and the graduate [[Master of Laws|LLM]]. The school also offers joint degrees: the JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] (Masters of Business) and JD-MEE (Masters of Environmental Studies). As well, students who already possess a civil law degree (an [[LL.L]] or a [[Bachelor of Civil Law|BCL]]) from a Canadian school can enroll at U de M for two semesters to complete an LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umoncton.ca/droit/imgs_demande/02Conditionsetpolitiquesgeneralesdadmission.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055532/http://www0.umoncton.ca/droit/imgs_demande/02Conditionsetpolitiquesgeneralesdadmission.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical Training Centre===
The [[Centre de Formation Médicale du Nouveau-Brunswick|University of Moncton's Medical Training Centre]] is the first francophone school of medicine in  [[Atlantic Canada]]. It is a joint medical programme, offered with the [[Université de Sherbrooke]].

===Health Sciences and Community Services===
L'École de nutrition et d'études familiales has an accredited dietetic program. The university is accredited by a professional organization such as the [[Dietitians of Canada]] and the university's graduates may subsequently become registered dietitians.

===Faculty of Sciences===
The faculty of Sciences is located in the Rémi-Rossignol building and covers all cores science subjects, such as: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, as well as Computer Science.

==Libraries==

There are six libraries and resource centres across the three campuses: [[Bibliothèque Champlain]] (Moncton), [[Bibliothèque Michel-Bastarache]] (Moncton), {{Interlanguage link multi|Centre d'études acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson|fr|3=Centre d'études acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson|vertical-align=sup}} (Moncton), [[Centre de ressources pédagogiques]] (Moncton), [[Bibliothèque Rhéa-Larose]] (Edmundston) and [[Bibliothèque Shippagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umoncton.ca/|title=Université de Moncton|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All records from these libraries are gathered into one catalogue: Catalogue Éloïze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eloize.umoncton.ca/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420053246/http://www.eloize.umoncton.ca/ |archive-date=20 April 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of these libraries, Michel-Bastarache and Centre de ressources pédagogiques, are special libraries, catering to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education, respectively. The Centre d'études acadiennes, found on the lower level of Bibliothèque Champlain, is a world-renowned and primary resource and archive centre for [[Acadian studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umoncton.ca/etudeacadiennes/centre/hist.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703123616/http://www0.umoncton.ca/etudeacadiennes/centre/hist.html |archive-date=3 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kf1ZwDifdAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=urmonotheism |title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|page=136|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=1-85075-657-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;

Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

A '''vactrain''' (or '''vacuum tube train''') is a proposed design for very-[[high-speed rail]] transportation. It is a [[maglev]] (magnetic levitation) line using partly [[vacuum|evacuated]] tubes or tunnels. Reduced air resistance could permit vactrains to travel at very high speeds with relatively little power—up to {{convert|4000|–|5000|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}. This is 5–6 times the [[speed of sound]] in Earth's atmosphere at sea level.&lt;ref name="eett"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Transatlantic Tunnel |episodelink=&lt;!-- for wikiarticle about episode --&gt; |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html |series=Extreme Engineering |serieslink=Extreme Engineering |credits=Joseph Giotta (Narrator), Powderhouse Productions |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |airdate=April 16, 2003 |transcripturl= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014656/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vactrains might use [[Gravity train|gravity]] to assist their acceleration. If these trains achieve the predicted speeds, they could surpass [[aircraft]] as the world's fastest mode of public transportation. 

However, without major advances in tunneling and other technology, vactrains would be prohibitively expensive.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==18th century==
{{main|Atmospheric railway}}
In 1799, [[George Medhurst]] of London conceived of and patented an [[Atmospheric railway#Medhurst | atmospheric railway]] that could convey people or cargo through pressurized or evacuated tubes.  The early atmospheric railways and pneumatic tube transport systems (such as the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]]) relied on steam power for propulsion.

==19th century==
In 1888, [[Michel Verne]], son of [[Jules Verne]], imagined a submarine pneumatic tube transport system that could propel a passenger capsule at speeds up to 1800 km/h under the Atlantic Ocean in a short story called "An Express of the Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0606611h.html | title=An Express of the Future | first=Michel | last=Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
The vactrain proper was invented by [[Robert Goddard]] as a freshman at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in the United States in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-scifi-story-robert-h-goddard-published-100-years-a-1494959842 | title=The SciFi Story Robert H. Goddard Published 100 Years Ago | website=gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goddard subsequently refined the idea in a 1906 short story called "The High-Speed Bet" which was summarized and published in a Scientific American editorial in 1909 called "The Limit of Rapid Transit".  Esther, his wife, was granted a US patent for the vactrain in 1950, five years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2511979 | title=Vacuum tube transportation system | website=patents.google.com | publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Russian professor {{Interlanguage link multi|Boris Weinberg|ru|3=Вейнберг, Борис Петрович}} built the world's first model of his proposed version of the vactrain at [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veinberg.o7.ru/ |title=Движение без трения. pre-α |trans-title=Motion without friction. pre-α |first=Boris |last=Weinberg |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Popular_Science_Monthly_Volume_90.djvu/721 |title=Five Hundred Miles an Hour |first=Boris |last=Weinberg |journal=Popular Science Monthly |year=1917 |volume=90 |pages=705–708}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later published a vactrain concept in 1914 in the book ''Motion without friction (airless electric way)''.

In 1955, Polish science-fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]] in a novel ''The Magellan Nebula'' wrote about intercontinental vactrain called "organowiec", which moved in a transparent tube at a speed higher than 1,666&amp;nbsp;km/h.
Later in April 1962, the vactrain appears in the story "Mercenary" by [[Mack Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mack|last = Reynolds|title = Mercenary|date = April 1962|publisher = [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24370/24370-h/24370-h.htm|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he mentions Vacuum Tube Transport in passing.

During the 1970s, a leading vactrain advocate, [[Robert M. Salter]] of [[RAND]], published a series of elaborate engineering articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Robert M.|last = Salter|author-link = Robert M. Salter|title = The Very High Speed Transit System|date = August 1972|publisher = [[RAND Corporation]]|url = https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P4874.html|accessdate = September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Robert M.|last = Salter|author-link = Robert M. Salter|title = Trans-Planetary Subway Systems: A Burgeoning Capability|date = February 1978|publisher = [[RAND Corporation]]|url = https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P6092.html|accessdate = September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview with Robert Salter appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (June 11, 1972). He discussed, in detail, the relative ease with which the [[U.S. government]] could build a tube shuttle system using technologies available at that time. Maglev being poorly developed at the time, he proposed steel wheels. The chamber's door to the tube would be opened, and enough air admitted behind to accelerate the train into the tube. Gravity would further accelerate the departing train down to cruise level. Rising from cruise level, the arriving train would decelerate by compressing the rarefied air ahead of it, which would be vented. Pumps at the stations would make up for losses due to friction or air escaping around the edges of the train, the train itself requiring no motor. This combination of modified (shallow) [[gravity train]] and [[atmospheric railway]] propulsion would consume little [[energy]] but limit the system to subsonic speeds, hence initial routes of tens or hundreds of miles or kilometers rather than transcontinental distances were proposed.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Trains were to require no [[Railway coupling|coupler]]s, each car being directly welded, bolted, or otherwise firmly connected to the next, the route calling for no more bending than the flexibility of steel could easily handle. At the end of the line the train would be moved sideways into the end chamber of the return tube. The railway would have both an inner evacuated tube and an outer tunnel. At cruise depth, the space between would have enough water to float the vacuum tube, softening the ride.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A route through the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] was laid out, with nine stations, one each in the [[Washington DC|District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], and two in [[Connecticut]]. [[Commuter rail]] systems were mapped for the [[San Francisco]] and New York areas, the commuter version having longer, heavier trains, to be propelled less by air and more by gravity than the intercity version. The New York system was to have three lines, terminating in [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], and [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Salter pointed out how such a system would help reduce the environmental damage being done to the atmosphere by [[aviation]] and surface transportation. He called underground Very High Speed Transportation (tube shuttles) his nation's "logical next step". The plans were never taken to the next stage.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

At the time these reports were published, national prestige was an issue as [[Japan]] had been operating its showcase [[shinkansen|bullet train]] for several years and [[maglev train]] research was hot technology. The American ''Planetran'' would establish transcontinental subway service in the United States and provide a commute from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]] in one hour. The tunnel would be buried to a depth of several hundred feet in solid rock formations. Construction would make use of [[laser]]s to ensure alignment and use [[tungsten]] probes to melt through [[igneous]] rock formations. The tunnel would maintain a partial vacuum to minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. A trip would average {{convert|3000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and subject passengers to accelerations up to 1.4 times that of gravity, requiring the use of [[gimbal]]led compartments. Enormous construction costs (estimated as high as US$1 trillion) were the primary reason why Salter's proposal was never built.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Swissmetro Network 2005.png|thumb|[[Swissmetro]] as proposed in 2005]]
Starting in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Swissmetro]] was proposed to leverage the invention of the experimental German [[Transrapid]] maglev train, and operate in large underground tunnels reduced to the pressure altitude of {{convert|68000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} at which the [[Concorde]] SST was certified to fly.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In the 1980s, [[Frank P. Davidson]], a founder and chairman of the [[Channel Tunnel]] project, and Japanese engineer {{Interlanguage link multi|Yoshihiro Kyotani|ja|3=京谷好泰}} tackled the transoceanic problems with a proposal to float a tube above the ocean floor, anchored with cables (a [[submerged floating tunnel]]). The transit tube would remain at least {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below the ocean surface to avoid water turbulence.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

On November 18, 1991, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] filed a patent application for a vactrain system. He called the company he wanted to form ''VSE International'', for velocity, silence, and efficiency.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept itself he called ''[[Magnetic Flight]]''.  The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to {{convert|2,500|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} – about five times faster than a jet airliner – if the air was evacuated from the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O'Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

==21st century==
[[James R. Powell]], former co-inventor of [[superconducting]] [[maglev]] in the 1960s, has since 2001 led investigation of a concept for using a maglev vactrain for [[space launch]] (theoretically two orders of magnitude less marginal cost than present rockets), where the [[StarTram]] proposal would have vehicles reach up to {{convert|8900|to|19600|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} within an acceleration tunnel (lengthy to limit [[g-force]]s), considering boring through the ice sheet in Antarctica for lower anticipated expense than in rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010|publisher=startram.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ET3 Global Alliance|ET3]] claim to have achieved some work that resulted in a patent on "evacuated tube transport technology" which was granted in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.et3.com |title=Why ET3? {{!}} Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies |publisher=ET3 |location=US |date=2013 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They presented their idea 2013 on public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.ideacity.ca/video/daryl-oster-speedy-travel-vacuum-tube/ |title=Speedy Travel in a Vaccuum Tube |first=Daryl |last=Oster |via=Idea City |location=US |date=October 9, 2013 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elon Musk]], CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, champions the vactrain concept under the term [[hyperloop]]. An agreement was signed in 2017 to co-develop a hyperloop line between Seoul and Busan in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/investment-in-hyperloop-routes-speeds-up |title=Investment in hyperloop routes speeds up |first=Jørn |last=Madslien |publisher=Institute of Mechanical Engineers |location=UK |date=July 19, 2017 |access-date=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valerius Josephus''' (Latin; Flemish: Valeer Jozef; French: Valère Joseph) '''Coucke''', 1888–1951, was a Belgian scholar and priest who was professor at the Grootseminarie Brugge (Grand Séminaire de Bruges) in the 1920s. His importance to modern scholarship comes from his writings in the field of Old Testament chronology. His study of the methods of the authors of the books of Kings and Chronicles led him to conclusions that were later discovered, independently, by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. A distinctive of his approach was the use of citations in classical authors in order to obtain fixed dates in biblical history, most notably the date for the beginning of construction of [[Solomon’s Temple]].

== Biography ==
Coucke was born on 2 February 1888, in Poperinge, in the province of West-Flanders in Belgium. He studied in Leuven, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in theology (S.T.B.). He was ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church in 1912 and was appointed to several parishes: Bredene, Staden, and Hooglede (all in the diocese of Bruges in Belgium). In 1919, he became a professor at the Grootseminarie in Brugge/Bruges (Le Grand Séminaire de Bruges), where he taught sacramental theology and moral theology. In 1927 he became the seminary’s librarian and also bursar, responsible for the finances of the seminary. In 1928, he was appointed canon of the Holy Savior’s Cathedral of Bruges. He died on 20 December 1951, in Bruges.

== Academic Contributions ==

=== Comparison of his chronology to that of Thiele ===
Coucke broke precedent with the approach of the [[Documentary hypothesis|Documentary Hypothesis]] that was popular among European scholars in his day by starting with the working proposition that the chronological data of Kings and Chronicles represented authentic traditions that could be understood once the methods of the ancient scribes were determined. This was in contrast to the skepticism to such an approach inherent in the postulates of the prevalent higher-critical methodology, which assumed that the chronological and other historical data of the Bible’s historical books were the product of late-date editors, and hence were of little or no historical value.&lt;ref&gt;"Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning." R. Kittel, ''A History of the Hebrews'', (London, 1986), II, P. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors who set out to write a synchronistic history of Judah and Israel, using as sources two sets of unrelated court chronicles . . . the editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully." Cyrus Gordon, ''The World of the Old Testament'' (New York: 1958), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Coucke departed from this presupposition-based approach, using instead the data of the biblical texts as his starting place (an inductive approach). From those data, he came to the following conclusions: 1) During the period of the divided kingdom, Judah’s regnal year began in the fall month of Tishri, whereas that of the northern kingdom, Israel, began in Nisan. (Coucke also allowed that the northern kingdom may have begun its calendar in the Egyptian month of Thoth, since Jeroboam resided in Egypt for many years before becoming the first king of Israel, but Coucke was wrong in assuming that at the time of Egypt’s [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]], Thoth came in the spring at the same time as the Hebrew Nisan.) 2) For the first few years of the divided kingdom, Judah used accession reckoning for its kings, whereas Israel used nonaccession reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;Accession reckoning counts the partial calendar year in which a king came to the throne as his "zero" year, whereas nonaccession reckoning counts it as his first year. Both methods were used in the ancient Near East. When reckoning spans of time counted by nonaccession reckoning, one year must be subtracted from the total for each monarch.&lt;/ref&gt; 3) During the rapprochement between the two kingdoms in the ninth century BC, Judah adopted Israel’s nonaccession reckoning. 4) Later, both kingdoms used accession reckoning until the end of their respective kingdoms, and 5) In order to make sense of the biblical data, coregencies, both those expressed explicitly in the text and those implied by the data, must be taken into account. This last principle has been much criticized when espoused by Thiele, but it is widely used by Egyptologists in their computations of Egyptian chronology.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977), esp. pp. 39, 44, 49, 81, 95, 169, 189–193, and 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

These five principles are identical to those later discovered by [[Edwin R. Thiele]], who was unaware of Coucke’s work when he published the results of his doctoral dissertation in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, "The Chronology of the Kings of Judah and Israel," ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'' 3 (1944), pp. 137–186.&lt;/ref&gt; It apparently was Thiele’s colleague, [[Siegfried Horn]], who introduced Thiele to the writings of Coucke when Horn came to America in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah’s Reign," ''[[Andrews University Seminary Studies]]'' 2 (1964), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his subsequent writings, Thiele acknowledged the earlier work of Coucke, and he was gratified that the discovery of these basic principles by two scholars working independently served to authenticate the soundness of their respective approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3d ed.; Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1981), p. 59, n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The two authors, however, differed somewhat on how to apply the principles they had discovered, so that their chronologies disagree in several places. They are in exact agreement at the beginning of the divided monarchy, which both Coucke and Thiele placed in the year starting in Nisan of 931 BC. Coucke’s method of deriving this date differed radically from Thiele’s method, as explained in the next two sections. For the end of the kingdom period, Coucke placed the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in the summer of 587 BC, whereas Thiele put it a year later, in 586.

=== His use of the Parian Marble to date construction of Solomon’s Temple ===
Coucke had some difficulty in determining dates for Ahab, king of Israel, and so he did not place the [[Battle of Qarqar]], at which Ahab was present, as the last year of Ahab, as Thiele did in assigning absolute (BC) dates to the first kings of Israel. His date for the battle, 854 BC, was also one year too early, although that was the date used by most Assyriologists when he wrote. He knew that it would be unwise to assign absolute dates to the kings in this time frame based on his proposed emendations of their reign lengths, and so he sought a more reliable method of finding a fixed date for the early monarchic period.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} He developed such a method in just three sentences of his ''Supplément'' article, using classical authors with no utilization of any biblical text. His starting place was the end of the [[Trojan War]], which the [[Parian Marble]] dated to the year 1208 BC, seven days before the end of the month of Thargelion, that is, 10 June 1208 BC&lt;ref&gt;For the determination of the Julian date, see Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, “Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies,” ''Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament'' 1.2 (2012) 235 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; (Coucke mistakenly thought that the Marble gave the year as 1207 BC, but the correct year of 1208 BC, as given at the Ashmolean Web site,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004006.html&lt;/ref&gt; will be used in what follows). He then cited a statement of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus/Justin]] (18:3:5) that said that Tyre was founded (or refounded)&lt;ref&gt;Tyre was in existence in the Amarna period (middle of 14th century BC), as shown by letters from its king to the pharaoh. However, it apparently had become abandoned and was subsequently resettled at the time of the invasion by the Sea Peoples, according to W. F. Albright, "The Role of the Canaanites in the History of Civilization" in G. E. Wright, ed., ''The Bible and the Ancient Near East'' (New York, 1961), p. 340, and H. J. Katzenstein, ''The History of Tyre from the Second Millennium B.C.E. until the Fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 538 B.C.E.'' (Jerusalem, 1973), pp. 59–61. The first invasion of the Sea People was in the reign of [[Merneptah]] (ca. 1213–1203 BC). Coucke’s date of 1209 BC for the (re)founding of Tyre, as derived from Josephus, would place it in this first invasion of the Sea Peoples when, according to Pompeius Trogus, the people of Ashkelon were driven from their city, after which they occupied Tyre. The [[Merneptah stele]] from Merneptah’s fifth year says that "Carried off is Ashkelon."&lt;/ref&gt; one year before the fall of Troy, that is, in 1209 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Coucke assumed that the founding of Tyre was in the summer preceding the fall of Troy. With his date of May 1207 BC for the fall of Troy, the founding of Tyre would be the summer of 1208 BC. Using the Tishri-based years that Coucke assumed for Tyre, this would be the year starting in Tishri of 1209 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Josephus]], who apparently was using the archives of Tyre as his source, he determined that it was either 240 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 8:3:1/62) or 241 years (''[[Against Apion]]'' 1:18/126) from Tyre’s founding to the 11th or 12th year of [[King Hiram I|Hiram, King of Tyre]], at which time Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Coucke therefore determined that Temple construction began in either (1209 BC – 240 =) 969 BC or (1209 BC – 241 =) 968 BC, depending on whether it was in the eleventh year of Hiram (so ''Antiquities'') or his twelfth year (so ''Against Apion'').&lt;ref&gt;V. Coucke, "Chronologie biblique" in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'' (ed. Louis Pirot; Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), Vol. 1, col. 1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== His use of the Tyrian King List to refine this date ===
Coucke had another avenue of approach to the date of construction of Solomon’s Temple. Like the first approach that started from the Parian Marble’s date for the fall of Troy, his second method was also derived from classical writings, with no utilization of biblical texts. It made use of the [[List of Kings of Tyre|list of Tyrian kings]] recorded in Josephus’s [[Against Apion]] 1:17/108 and 1:18/117–126. In providing the list of kings, Josephus said he was taking his information from [[Menander of Ephesus]], who translated the records of the Tyrian archives from Phoenician into Greek. Although the individual reign lengths of the various kings in the list show considerable variation due to copying errors over the centuries since Josephus wrote, the total number of years given from the time that Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of Temple construction to the flight of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido/Elissa]] from Tyre, after which she and her associates founded [[Carthage]], has been preserved intact due to its three-fold repetition. This figure is given twice as 143 years and eight months, and once as 155 years from the accession of Hiram, minus the 12 years until he began to help Solomon. This redundancy of expression has preserved the total of years in virtually all extant copies of the Tyrian King List, so that Coucke and other scholars have felt confident in using it in their calculations.

Coucke derived either 825 or 824 BC as the possible dates for the founding of Carthage, based on Pompeius Trogus’s statement that it was founded 72 years before the founding of Rome, for which Coucke accepted either 753 BC ([[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]) or 752 BC ([[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]). Using the statement of Josephus/Menander that placed the founding of Solomon’s Temple 143 years earlier than the founding of Carthage, Coucke derived 968 or 967 BC as the dates for the founding of Solomon’s Temple. Since only the first of these agreed with the two dates he had derived when starting from the Parian Marble (969 and 968), he decided on 968/67 BC as the time of foundation of the Temple. He assumed Tyre used Tishri-based years, since the use of Phoenician month-names (Ziv, Bul, Ethanim) in the time of Solomon suggested that Israel and Tyre were using the same calendar at this time in their histories.&lt;ref&gt;V. Coucke, "Chronologie des rois de Juda et d’Israël," ''Revue bénedictine'' 37 (1925), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; With this assumption, he then turned to the biblical datum that construction began in the spring month of Ziv, deriving the date for the beginning of construction as the spring of 967 BC, with Solomon’s fourth year (1 Kings 6:1) starting in Tishri of 968 BC.

== Writings ==
Only two publications by Coucke are known. The earlier is the article "Chronologie des rois de Juda et d’Israël," ''Revue bénedictine'' 37 (1925), pp.&amp;nbsp;325–364. The ideas and chronology of this article were expanded and included in his contribution to the article "Chronologie biblique" in ''Supplément au dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1 (Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), cols. 1245-1279. In late 2010, a search by the principal librarian of the Grootseminarie library, where Coucke had been principal librarian several decades previously, failed to find any further publications for which he was the author.
