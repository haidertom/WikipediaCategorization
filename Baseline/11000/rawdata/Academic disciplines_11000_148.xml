The '''Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences''' (AS-SMS) is an autonomous institute affiliated with the [[Government College University Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="The Government College University  Official website "&gt;{{Cite web|last=(GCU) |first=Government College University |authorlink=Government College University, Lahore |coauthors= |title=Science Research at GCU: The Abdus Salam School of Mathematics |work= |publisher=The Government College University  Official website |url=http://www.gcu.edu.pk/ASSMS.htm |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016190004/http://gcu.edu.pk/ASSMS.htm |archivedate=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is named after the [[theoretical physicist]] and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Abdus Salam]].

==History==
[[Abdus Salam]] played an influential role in formulating policies for the development of science in Pakistan in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He helped establish a number of research institutes in Pakistan including the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] (PINSTECH) and the Atomic Energy Commission.

In 2003, the [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|Government of Punjab]] established a center of excellence in mathematical sciences, the School of Mathematical Sciences, affiliated with Government College University, Lahore.&lt;ref name="The Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences Official website"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =ASSMS   | first =The Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title =Achievements   | work =   | publisher =The Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences Official website   | url =http://www.sms.edu.pk/?page_id=1176   | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the school is to create a world-class doctoral research institute in mathematics, but rooted in a developing country like Pakistan.&lt;ref name="GC University Lahore Prospectus 2014 "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcu.edu.pk/Forms/ProspectusBA-M.Phil/2014/83-92.pdf |title=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |publisher=GC University Lahore |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021111/http://www.gcu.edu.pk/Forms/ProspectusBA-M.Phil/2014/83-92.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Report of ASSMS"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sms.edu.pk/downloads/phd/areportonassms.pdf | title=A Report of ASSMS | publisher= Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences | accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062917/http://www.sms.edu.pk/downloads/phd/areportonassms.pdf |archivedate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was later named after Abdus Salam who was professor of mathematics at the Government College (Lahore) from 1951 to 1954.

Ghulam Murtaza, an eminent physicist who held the Abdus Salam Chair at Government College University, was appointed the first Director-General of the school. The second Director-General was Alla Ditta Raza Choudary, an emeritus professor from [[Central Washington University]]. The third director general of the school was Shahid Saeed Siddiqi, who was a professor of mathematics at the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]]. Since March 2017 the director general of the school is again Ghulam Murtaza who also holds the [[Abdus Salam Chair in Physics]] at the Government College University (Lahore).

==Program overview==
[[File:Abdus Salam School.jpg|thumb|Foreign Faculty Tiberiu Dumitrescu and [[:ro:Ioan Tomescu|Ioan Tomescu]] ([[University of Bucharest|Bucharest]]) with doctorands at the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences]]ASSMS requires an intensive two-year course for all the students admitted. The first year is dedicated to basic university mathematics course, and in the second year students take more advanced and optional courses in diverse areas of mathematics. At the end  of their second year, students choose one of the research groups at AS-SMS, which are geometry, algebra, analysis, discrete mathematics, applied mathematics, and stochastic processes.&lt;ref name="Editorial in Newsletter of European Mathematical Society about ASSMS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laudal|first=Arnfinn|date=June 2011|title=Editorial: Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences|url=https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2011-06-80.pdf|journal=Newsletter of European Mathematical Society|publisher=EMS Publishing House|issue=80|pages=3–4|access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduation rate at the end of fifth year is high.&lt;ref name="Article about ASSMS by Loring W.

The institution provides free-of-cost education to its students. It also provides financial assistance to its students.&lt;ref name="GC University Lahore Prospectus 2014 "/&gt;

==Achievements==
[[File:Abdus Salam School 2.jpg|thumb|[[János Pach]], Edy T. Baskoro ([[Bandung Institute of Technology|ITB]]), [[:ro:Ioan Tomescu|Ioan Tomescu]] and students at a conference in the school.]]
Since its inception until early 2014, AS-SMS has produced more than 100 Ph.D. This is more than twice the total number of Ph.Ds in mathematics produced by all other universities in Pakistan in the same period.&lt;ref name="ASSMS Lahore conferred the 100th Ph.D"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Laudal | first1=Arnfinn |last2=Sanz-Solé |first2=Marta |last3=Waldschmidt |first3=Michel|date=March 2014 | title=A Mathematical Anniversary in Pakistan| journal=Newsletter of European Mathematical Society  |issue=91 | pages=8–9 |publisher=EMS Publishing House |url=https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2014-03-91.pdf|access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has produced more than 800 publications in [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]]-indexed journals.&lt;ref name="GC University Lahore Prospectus 2014 "/&gt;

AS-SMS has organized several international level workshops and conferences. Some of workshops at ASSMS has been chosen to have funding from the [[ICTP]], [[UNESCO]], and CIMPA (International Centre for Pure and Applied Mathematics). The signature conferences of ASSMS are its “World/International Conferences of Mathematics in the 21st Century” series, which has been held in 2004,&lt;ref name="World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wc2004.sms.edu.pk/ |title=1st World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040506084642/http://www.wc2004.sms.edu.pk/ |archivedate=May 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005,&lt;ref name="The 2nd World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc2005.sms.edu.pk/ |title=2nd World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209184818/http://wc2005.sms.edu.pk/ |archivedate=February 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007,&lt;ref name="The 3rd International Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc2007.sms.edu.pk/index.php |title=3rd International Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813135456/http://wc2007.sms.edu.pk/index.php |archivedate=August 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009,&lt;ref name="The 4th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc2009.sms.edu.pk/ |title=4th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107042044/http://wc2009.sms.edu.pk/ |archivedate=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011,&lt;ref name="The 5th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc2011.sms.edu.pk/doku.php |title=5th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728112434/http://wc2011.sms.edu.pk/doku.php |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013.&lt;ref name="The 6th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc2013.sms.edu.pk/doku.php |title=6th World Conference in 21st Century Mathematics |publisher=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=18 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003932/http://wc2013.sms.edu.pk/doku.php |archivedate=March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last conference has its proceedings published by the prestigious [[Springer Publishing]] by the title "Mathematics in the 21st Century"; with [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], A. D. R. Choudary (the then Director General of AS-SMS), and [[Michel Waldschmidt]] as the editors.&lt;ref name="Springer Book: “Mathematics in the 21st Century" &gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783034808583 | title= Mathematics in the 21st Century | publisher= Springer | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AS-SMS was chosen as Post-Doctoral research destination from Ph.D holders from prestigious institutions around the world. Young researchers from Russia, Italy, Romania, Indonesia, and other countries have become Post Doctoral Fellows in ASSMS. This is something that not used to happen in any mathematics institution in Pakistan before the existence of ASSMS.&lt;ref name="GC University Lahore Prospectus 2014 " /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Report of ASSMS"/&gt;

On the recommendation of the Committee for Developing Countries (CDC) of the [[European Mathematical Society]], AS-SMS was labeled “Emerging Regional Centre of Excellence of the European Mathematical Society” (ERCE) for the period of 2011-2015.&lt;ref name="European Mathematical Society Website "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/erce.php | title=Emerging Regional Centre of Excellence | publisher=European Mathematical Society | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Success Story of Higher Education Committee of Pakistan: ASSMS"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/HRD/FacultyHiringPrograms/FFHP/Pages/ASSMS.aspx | title= Foreign Faculty Hiring Program: ASSMS | publisher= Higher Education Commission of Pakistan | accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304230457/http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/HRD/FacultyHiringPrograms/FFHP/Pages/ASSMS.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, AS-SMS and some other ERCE have form Network of International Mathematics Centres in 2013, where ASSMS was supposed to be its initial secretariat.&lt;ref name="Network of International Mathematic Centres"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CDC_MENAO/nim-icm14.pdf | title= Network of International Mathematic Centres |publisher=The International Mathematical Union | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the high school level, the school initiated the training camps for preparation and selection of the national team of Pakistan to compete at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (IMO). The school continued to organize these training camps until 2014. The national team of Pakistan competed at IMO for the very first time in 2005, won its first medal in 2007 and its first silver medal in 2013.&lt;ref name="International Mathematical Olympiad Official Site "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=PAK | title=Pakistan Results in IMO | publisher=International Mathematics Olympiad | accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11002">The '''Arts Olympiad''' is an international art competition for children ages 8 to 12 organized by [[International Child Art Foundation]] with one million participants from seventy countries. Each competition is four years long and it is held every four year. The competition includes the element of art and peace to encourage children around the world to use creativity and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising Practices - Arts Olympiad|url=http://www.arizonahealthmatters.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PromisePractice&amp;file=promisePractice&amp;pid=769|publisher=The Healthy Communities Institute|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq, founder of the International Child Art Foundation, started the first Arts Olympiad competition in 1999&lt;ref name="1st-ao"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Arts Olympiad (1997-2000)|url=http://www.icaf.org/whatwedo/ao/1st-ao.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the issue which was coined decades earlier as the "fourth grade slump" in creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrance|first=Ellis Paul|title=Understanding the fourth grade slump in creative thinking: final report|year=1967|publisher=University of Minnesota|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers at the time suggested that the phenomenon is a result of a drop in creativity around the ages of nine as they start conforming to [[standardized test]]ing and to please parents and teachers. The plan was to let children who were the winners of [[U.S. state]]s and other countries to come together in a festival to let them work together and learn other cultures with the goal to move future generations toward [[World peace|global peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Jane Hess|title=Get Out and Give Back: World Children’s Festival|url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/06/13/get-out-and-give-back-world-children%E2%80%99s-festival/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Washington Life Magazine|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for the first Art Olympiad was ''My World in the Year 2000'' to ask children to create art in which they envisioned themselves in the [[new millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Of Peace: Art By Young People|url=http://go.worldbank.org/HE9OOAUR30|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one million children in 86 countries in the program which was run between 1997 and 2000. The winning pieced from around the world were exhibited at the ''World Children’s Festival'' in 1999 on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The artworks were also later exhibited at the [[White House Millennium Council#White House Millennium Celebration|White House Millennium Celebration]], the [[United Nations Headquarters]], and the 2003 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="1st-ao"/&gt;

Since then the format of the global competition, a festival in Washington, DC and global exhibitions have been following in the next Arts Olympiad cycles. The 2nd Arts Olympiad was held between 2001 and 2004 with the theme of ''Me in the New Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ashley|title=Me in the New Millennium.(Perspective)(ICAF's 2000-2004 Arts Olympiad)|journal=ChildArt|date=1 April 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140305540.html|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 3rd Arts Olympiad (2005-2008), the theme was shifted to relate art and sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Peace Project and Resources: Arts Olympiad|url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087|publisher=International Year for the Culture of Peace - Unesco|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707045049/http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087#|archive-date=2010-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the artist-athlete ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President's Challenge / About / Advocates / Nonprofit|url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml|publisher=The President’s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025013502/https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml#|archive-date=2012-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Arts Olympiad (2009-2012) continued the same theme with title ''My Favorite Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAC Partners International Child Art Foundation(ICAF) |url=http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222172708/http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |publisher=National Council for Arts &amp; Culture, Nigeria |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection Process==
During the first two years of the competition, local schools are participated in the Arts Olympiad lesson plan. The artworks as the result of the lessons are then put into a selection process.

The selection process in the United States is first done from at the local [[school district]]. The selection of artworks from within a school or school district. The artworks are then submitted to Washington, DC for another selection to have a representative of each participating state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berwick Academy selected to represent Maine at World Children's Festival|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110311/GJNEWS_01/703119949&amp;template=SouthernMaineRegion|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Fosters Daily Democrat|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, the partner in each country will administrate the selection. The selection can be in many phases involving the competition at the local level and at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=150 in Arts Olympiad|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/3/central/13010258&amp;sec=central|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=3 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gana niño mazatleco Olimpiada del Arte a nivel nacional|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=660595&amp;id_seccion=84363|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Noroeste.com|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners who represent the participating U.S. states and countries are invited to the World Children's Festival in Washington, DC.

==World Children's Festival==
The World Children's Festival is a three-day festival held every four years on the National Mall in Washington, DC for winners of the Arts Olympiad to participate. The festival includes over 50 performances and many art-related workshops. It also has sessions for the winners from different countries to co-create artworks with many adult artists.&lt;ref name="south-south"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan |first=Richard |title=4th World Children's Festival Held at the National Mall in Washington, DC |url=http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104844/http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |newspaper=South-South News |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Before the event, the Arts Olympiad winners from Washington, D.C. are asked to be ambassadors for the festival and exchange emails with international winners to welcome to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Children's Festival|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/misc-events/the-world-childrens-festival,1209274/critic-review.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international winners are welcomed to the host families around the Washington area.

Children share ideas and work together during the three-day festival. On the last night of the festival, the celebratory dinner is held with all guests dressing in [[Folk costume|national attire]].&lt;ref name="south-south"/&gt;

Similar festivals have been replicated in other counties such as the European Children’s Festival at Olympia Park in Munich in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of World’s Largest Art Program for Children Earns The Academy’s Distinguished Service Award|url=http://ussa.edu/publications/news/2011/10/27/founder-of-worlds-largest-art-program-for-children-earns-the-academys-distinguished-service-award/|publisher=United States Sports Academy|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Exhibitions==
After the World Children's Festival, the winning pieces will travel to exhibitions in the U.S. and internationally. The past exhibitions have been in [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Uganda]], [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAF Exhibitions 1998-2011|url=http://icaf.org/pdfs/ICAF%20Exhibitions%201998-2011.pdf|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Winners==
The organizer have seen the potential and the importance of Art Olympiad winners to promote the cause. An example was demonstrated when a winner from [[Peru]] who have gone through difficulties in arranging competition because there was no office of the Internal Child Art Foundation in the country, that child eventually set up and organize the competition in the country for the next season with the support from the [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|ministry of education]]. With that, they started encouraging the winners to contribute back to the program and set up a youth board for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashfaq Ishaq Discusses Challenges Faced Due To Lack of Arts Education |url=http://www.eclips.cornell.edu/clip.do?id=5127&amp;clipID=5127&amp;tab=TabClipPage |publisher=Charles H.

===Youth Board Members===
In each cycle of the Arts Olympiad competition, a number of winners are choose to serve the youth board of the organization. Their roles are to be organization's [[spokesperson]]s, conduct fundraising to support the programs, write for ChildArt magazine, help stage and be the [[master of ceremonies]] at the World Children's Festival, and nominate innovative leaders, companies and organizations for the World Children's Award.

Since the formation of the youth board there have been 38 members from two dozen counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICAF Youth Board|url=http://www.icaf.org/about/youth.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences''', abbreviated '''BITSS''', is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing [[transparency]] and openness in [[social science]] research. It was established in 2012 by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Center for Effective Global Action]]. It is led by an interdisciplinary group of academics from ten different universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bitss.org/about/ |title=About |date=2015-10-08 |website=Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the [[Center for Open Science]] to define and promote a set of best practices for social scientists to maximize transparency in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miguel |first=E. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. |last3=Casey |first3=K. |last4=Cohen |first4=J. |last5=Esterling |first5=K.

'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. Dual Language or Two-Way Immersion education refers to programs that provide grade-level content and literacy instruction to all students through two languages, English and a partner language. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. There are four main types of dual language programs, these programs refer to how a student would best learn with Dual Language Immersion based on their previous language skills.
**'''Developmental, or maintenance bilingual programs.''' These programs enroll students who are native speakers of the partner language to learn English.
**'''Bilingual immersion programs.''' This program enrolls both native English speaker and native speakers of the partner language.
**'''Foreign language Immersion.''' This program primarily enrolls students who speak English as their native language.
**'''Heritage language programs.''' These programs enroll students who primarily dominant in english, but a close relative (parents, grandparents) speak the partner language.
**There are two basic models for Dual Language Immersion The first model is '''90/10 model'''. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987). The goal of gradually increasing the majority of the language is for instruction to become 50% of English and 50% of the partner language. The second model is the '''50/50 model'''. In the 50/50 model English and the partner language are used equally throughout the program.

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21  |issue=6  |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations|date=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018|date=2018-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Senegal.pdf "World Data on Education, Senegal"]. UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z4O3bcRUwKQC |title =Language Policy in the People's Republic of China: Theory and Practice Since 1948
|author= Minglang Zhou, Hongkai Sun
|publisher= Springer|year= 2004
|isbn= 978-1-4020-8038-8|pages =119–120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====

In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

=====India=====
{{Main|Bilingualism in India}}
The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100821182443/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074%2C%20s.%202009.pdf DepEd Order 74 of 2009] (PDF, archived from [http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf the original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225924/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }} on 2010-08-21))&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Philippine languages|Philippine regional languages]] are taught in schools, colleges and universities located in their [[Provinces of the Philippines|respective provinces]].

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education. Towards a Renewed Framework?|url=|journal=Archive Ouverte en Sciences de l'Homme et de la Société|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S. Lek en Linge, Culemborg https://www.lekenlinge.nl/downloaddocument?pid=163&amp;doc=KDEyKS10d2VldGFsaWctdm1iby10LnBkZg==&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced, too.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

===Americas===

====North America====

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

=====United States=====
[[File:SER-Niños Charter School.jpg|thumb|[[SER-Niños Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1044 |doi=10.3102/0002831208320790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =978-1-85359-297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Effects of mother-tongue instruction ==
Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children's mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

In [[telecommunications]], '''busy-hour call attempts''' ('''BHCA''') is a [[teletraffic engineering]] measurement used to evaluate and plan capacity for [[telephone network]]s.&lt;ref name= Waite&gt;{{Google books|TNgtaRRIH1AC|A Practical Guide to Call Center Technology|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; BHCA is the number of [[telephone call]]s attempted at the sliding 60-minute period during which occurs the maximum total [[Traffic volume|traffic load]] in a given 24-hour period (BHCA), and the higher the BHCA, the higher the stress on the network processors.  BHCA is not to be confused with busy hour call completion (BHCC) which measures the throughput capacity of the network. If a bottleneck in the network exists with a capacity lower than the estimated BHCA, then [[network congestion|congestion]] will occur resulting in many failed calls and customer dissatisfaction. 

BHCA is usually used when planning [[telephone switching]] capacities and frequently goes side by side with the [[Erlang unit]] capacity calculation. As an example, a telephone exchange with a capacity of one million BHCA is estimated to handle 250,000 subscribers. The overall calculation is more complex however, and involves accounting for available circuits, desired blocking rates, and Erlang capacity allocated to each subscriber.

==Determination==
The busy hour is determined by fitting a horizontal [[line (mathematics)|line segment]] equivalent to one hour under the traffic [[load curve]] about the peak load point. If the service [[time]] interval is less than 60 minutes, the busy hour is the 60-minute interval that contains the service timer interval. In cases where more than one busy hour occurs in a 24-hour period, ''i.e.,'' when [[wikt:Transwiki:Saturation (telecommunications)|saturation]] occurs, the busy hour or hours most applicable to the particular situation are used.

'''Central massive object''' ('''CMO''') refers to a mass concentration at the center of a [[galaxy]]. It can be either a [[supermassive black hole]] or a [[nuclear star cluster]].

The most massive galaxies are thought to always contain a supermassive black hole (SBH); these galaxies do not contain nuclear star clusters, and the CMO is identified with the SBH.

'''Computer-aided design''' ('''CAD''') is the use of [[computer system]]s (or {{vanchor|[[workstation]]s|WORKSTATION}}) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a [[design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=K.

Lalit|title=Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall of India|location=New Delhi|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXdivq93WIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=812033342X}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The term '''CADD''' (for ''Computer Aided Design and Drafting'') is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duggal |first=Vijay |year=2000 |title=Cadd Primer: A General Guide to Computer Aided Design and Drafting-Cadd, CAD |isbn=978-0962916595 |publisher=Mailmax Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its use in designing electronic systems is known as [[electronic design automation]] ('''EDA'''). In [[mechanical design]] it is known as [[mechanical design automation]] ('''MDA''') or '''computer-aided drafting''' ('''CAD'''), which includes the process of creating a [[technical drawing]] with the use of [[computer software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=David A.|title=Engineering Drawing &amp; Design|year=2012|publisher=Delmar|location=Clifton Park, NY|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdtJDEPZrrkC&amp;pg=PA2|isbn=1111309574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce [[raster graphics]] showing the overall appearance of designed objects. However, it involves more than just shapes. As in the manual [[wikt:drafting|drafting]] of [[technical drawing|technical]] and [[engineering drawing]]s, the output of CAD must convey information, such as [[material]]s, [[manufacturing process|process]]es, [[dimension]]s, and [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]]s, according to application-specific conventions.

CAD may be used to design curves and figures in [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farin, Gerald |author2=Hoschek, Josef |author3=Kim, Myung-Soo |title=Handbook of computer aided geometric design [electronic resource]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SV5G8fgxLoC|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAD is an important [[industrial arts|industrial art]] extensively used in many applications, including [[automotive]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[aerospace]] industries, industrial and [[architectural design]], [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], and many more. CAD is also widely used to produce [[computer animation]] for [[special effect]]s in movies, [[advertising]] and technical manuals, often called DCC [[digital content creation]]. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s. Because of its enormous economic importance, CAD has been a major driving force for research in [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]] (both hardware and software), and [[discrete differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Pottmann, H.; Brell-Cokcan, S. and Wallner, J.

The design of [[geometric model]]s for object shapes, in particular, is occasionally called ''computer-aided geometric design'' (''CAGD'').&lt;ref&gt;Farin, Gerald (2002) [http://www.farinhansford.com/books/cagd/ ''Curves and Surfaces for CAGD: A Practical Guide''], Morgan-Kaufmann, {{ISBN|1-55860-737-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of CAD software==
Starting around the mid 1960s, with the IBM Drafting System, computer-aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting, the cost-benefit for companies to switch to  CAD became apparent. The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today;  automated generation of [[Bill of Material]], auto layout in [[integrated circuits]], interference checking, and many others. Eventually, CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsmen, designers and engineering roles begin to merge. It did not eliminate departments, as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman, designers and engineers. CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry.
Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drafting systems to 3D [[Solid modeling|solid]] and [[Freeform surface modelling|surface]] modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling.

CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

CAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry, furniture, appliances, etc. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. [[4D BIM]] is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management.

CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of [[CAx|computer-aided technologies]], with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened [[Systems_development_life_cycle#Design|design cycle]]. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.

==Uses==
Computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.

CAD is one part of the whole Digital Product Development (DPD) activity within the [[Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:

*[[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) and [[Finite element analysis]] (FEA)
*[[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) including instructions to [[Computer Numerical Control]] (CNC) machines
*[[Photorealistic rendering]] and Motion Simulation.
*Document management and [[revision control]] using [[Product Data Management]] (PDM).

CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.

CAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well. Using four properties which are history, features, parametrization, and high-level constraints. The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model. Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size, shape, and other properties of the different modeling elements. The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength, yield strength, electrical or electromagnetic properties. Also its stress, strain, [[Timing closure|timing]] or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures, etc.

==Types==
[[File:CAD Modeling.gif|thumb|A simple procedure]]
{{see also|Comparison of computer-aided design editors}}
There are several different types of CAD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = 3D Feature-based, Parametric Solid Modeling|work=engineershandbook.com
 | url = http://engineershandbook.com/Software/cad2.htm#3dp
}}&lt;/ref&gt; each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each.

There are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems, including a number of free and open-source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft.

''3D [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]]'' is basically an extension of 2D drafting (not often used today). Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.

''3D "dumb" solids'' are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects (not often used today). Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (prisms, cylinders, spheres, and so on) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components, set limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.

There are two types of ''[[solid modeling|3D Solid Modeling]]''

# ''Parametric modeling'' allows the operator to use what is referred to as "design intent". The objects and features created are modifiable. Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created. If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part, the operator should locate it from the center of the model. The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part, but this random placement would defeat the design intent. If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships.
# ''[[Explicit modeling|Direct or Explicit modeling]]'' provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. With direct modeling, once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch. As with parametric modeling, [[direct modeling]] has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry (e.g., tangency, concentricity).

Top end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic, aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs. [[Freeform surface modeling]] is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.

==Technology==
[[File:cad mouse 1.svg|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]].]]

Originally software for Computer-Aided Design systems was developed with computer languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]] but with the advancement of [[object-oriented programming]] methods this has radically changed. Typical modern [[parametric feature-based modeler]] and [[freeform surface]] systems are built around a number of key [[C (programming language)|C]] modules with their own [[application programming interface|API]]s. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with [[NURBS]] geometry or [[boundary representation]] (B-rep) data via a [[geometric modeling kernel]]. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.

Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of [[prototyping]] called [[digital prototyping]]. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an [[industrial CT scanning]] machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.

Today, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]] and [[Mac OS X]]); some packages support multiple platforms.

Right now, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern [[graphics card]], high speed (and possibly multiple) [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and large amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] may be recommended.

The human-machine interface is generally via a [[computer mouse]] but can also be via a pen and digitizing [[graphics tablet]]. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a [[3Dconnexion|Spacemouse/SpaceBall]]. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for [[Scientific visualization|viewing the 3D model]].Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users.

CAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) on a [[personal computer]] system. Most applications support [[solid modeling]] with [[boundary representation]] (B-Rep) and [[NURBS]] geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats. A [[geometric modeling kernel]] is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications.

Based on market statistics, [[commercial software]] from Autodesk, Dassault Systems, Siemens PLM Software, and PTC dominate the CAD industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caewatch.com/the-big-6-in-cadcaeplm-software-industry-2011/ The Big 6 in CAD/CAE/PLM software industry (2011)], CAEWatch, September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011|title=GLOBAL SOFTWARE TOP 100 - EDITION 2011|publisher=Software Top 100|date=2011-08-23|first=Michel|last=van Kooten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of major CAD applications, grouped by usage statistics.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;[http://www.beyondmech.com/pro-e/cad-topic-33.html List of mechanical CAD softwares], BeyondMech&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Shannon|Digital computers]] were used in power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-"[[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]" in [[Network analyzer (AC power)|1949]]. Circuit&lt;ref&gt;illustrated symbolic diagram [[:File:Biquad circuit.gif]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital electronics|design]] theory, or [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz|power network]] methodology would be [[Linear algebra|algebraic]], [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm|symbolic]], and often [[Euclidean vector|vector]]-based. Examples of problems being solved in the mid-1940s to 50s include: servo motors controlled by generated pulse (1949), a digital computer with built-in computer operations to automatically co-ordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors (1951) and the essentially graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url= http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1952/5041/00/50410133.pdf |title= Numerically Controlled Milling Machine |first1= Alfred K. |last1= Susskind |first2= James O. |last2= McDonough |date= March 1953 |conference= International Workshop on Managing Requirements Knowledge |conference-url= http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1952/5041/00/index.html |editor= |book-title= Review of Input and Output Equipment Used in Computing Systems |publisher= [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] |location= New York City |format= PDF |id= |lccn= 53-7874 |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |access-date= 2015-02-24 |ref= |page= 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were accomplished with the use of computer software. The man credited with coining the term CAD,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Douglas T. (17 March 1961). [http://images.designworldonline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CADhistory/8436-TM-5.pdf Computer-Aided Design: A Statement of Objectives]. MIT USAF 8436-TM-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas T. Ross]], stated, "As soon as I saw the interactive display equipment," [being used by radar operators 1953] he saw it would be just what his SAGE related data reduction group needed. With the Lincoln Lab people, they were the only ones who used the big, complex display systems put in for the pre-SAGE, Cape Cod system. But "we used it for our own personal workstation.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/107611/oh178dtr.pdf?sequence=1|title=oh178dtr.pdf|author=|date=|website=umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flowcharts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session. They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flowcharts.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J. (1989) [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=77280 Retrospectives II: The Early Years in Computer Graphics], pp. 39–73 in SIGGRAPH 89 Panel Proceedings, ACM New York, NY, USA, {{ISBN|0-89791-353-1}} {{DOI|10.1145/77276.77280}}&lt;/ref&gt; And that an object once drawn could be reproduced at will, its orientation, Linkage [ [[Flux linkage|flux]], [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical]], [[Linkage (software)|lexical scoping]] ] or scale changed. This suggested numerous possibilities to them. It took ten years of interdisciplinary development&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Writer, Scopewriter pp. 3–17 Weisberg, David E. [http://www.cadhistory.net/toc.htm The Engineering Design Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt; work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT's labs. Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft, automotive, industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction, NC programming, and design analysis, most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later. Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1957 novel ''The Door into Summer'' suggested the possibility of a robotic ''Drafting Dan''. However, probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by [[Pierre Bézier]], [[Paul de Casteljau]] ([[Citroen]]), [[Steven Anson Coons]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]), James Ferguson ([[Boeing]]), [[Carl de Boor]] ([[General Motors|GM]]), Birkhoff (GM) and Garibedian (GM) in the 1960s and W. Gordon (GM) and R. Riesenfeld in the 1970s.

The invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to a French engineer, [[Pierre Bézier]] ([[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]], Renault). After his mathematical work concerning surfaces, he developed [[UNISURF]], between 1966 and 1968, to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry. Then, UNISURF became the working base for the following generations of CAD software.

It is argued{{by who|date=June 2017}} that a turning point was the development of the [[Sketchpad|SKETCHPAD]] system at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;Yares, Evan (February 13, 2013) [http://www.designworldonline.com/50-years-of-cad/#_ 50 Years of CAD]. DesignWorld&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/labnotes/LookingBack_19_1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107151904/http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/labnotes/LookingBack_19_1.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-07 |title=Looking Back: The TX-2 Computer and Sketchpad 82|journal=Lincoln Laboratory Journal|volume=19|issue=1|year =2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ivan Sutherland]] (who later created a graphics technology company with David Evans). The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically: the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[Computer display|monitor]] with a [[light pen]]. Effectively, it was a prototype of [[graphical user interface]], an indispensable feature of modern CAD. Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System in 1963 at a [[Joint Computer Conference]] having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper with Doctoral advisor Claude Shannon . Quoting, "For drawings where motion of the drawing or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user, Sketchpad excels. For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required, Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile. For drawings which merely communicate with shops, it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil." Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the [[Computer-automated design|designers drawings communicate]] not just with shops but with the [[STEP-NC|shop tool]] itself. This goal would be a long time arriving.

The first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in electronics. Only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations. Notable company projects were, a joint project of [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] ([[Patrick J. Hanratty]]) and [[IBM]] ([http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v32n1/columns/machover.html Sam Matsa], Doug Ross's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] APT research assistant) to develop a prototype system for design engineers [[DAC-1]] (Design Augmented by Computer) 1964; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] projects; [[Nokia Bell Labs|Bell]] GRAPHIC 1 and [[Renault]].

One of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of MCS (Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc.) in 1971 by Patrick J. Hanratty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = MCS Founder: Patrick J. Hanratty, Ph.D., President and Founder

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the system ADAM (Automated Drafting And Machining) but more importantly supplied code to companies such as [[McDonnell Douglas]] ([[Unigraphics]]), [[Computervision]] ([[CADDS]]), [[Calma]], [[Gerber Scientific|Gerber]], [[Auto-Trol Technology|Autotrol]] and [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]].

As computers became more affordable, the application areas have gradually expanded. The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction.

Other key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of CAD systems [[UGS Corp.|United Computing]], [[Intergraph]], [[IBM]], Intergraph IGDS in 1974 (which led to [[Bentley Systems]] [[MicroStation]] in 1984).

CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then. Initially, with 3D in the 1970s, it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings. Advances in programming and computer hardware,&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, Kurt (1981) [http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS/EGGH/EGGH91/003-005.pdf Issues and Directions for Graphics Hardware Accelerators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019203041/http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS/EGGH/EGGH91/003-005.pdf |date=2014-10-19 }}. Eurographics Digital Laboratory, diglib.eg.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Computer1984_6 Computer Graphics (4/5/1984)]. archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; notably solid modeling in the 1980s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.

Key products for 1981 were the solid modeling packages - [[Romulus (b-rep solid modeler)|Romulus]] (ShapeData) and Uni-Solid (Unigraphics) based on PADL-2 and the release of the surface modeler [[CATIA]] ([[Dassault Systemes]]). Autodesk was founded 1982 by John Walker, which led to the 2D system [[AutoCAD]]. The next milestone was the release of [[Pro/ENGINEER]] in 1987, which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features. Also of importance to the development of CAD was the development of the B-rep solid modeling kernels (engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects) [[Parasolid]] (ShapeData) and [[ACIS]] (Spatial Technology Inc.) at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, both inspired by the work of Ian Braid. This led to the release of mid-range packages such as [[SolidWorks]] and TriSpective (later known as [[Ironcad|IRONCAD]]) in 1995, [[Solid Edge]] (then [[Intergraph]]) in 1996 and [[Autodesk Inventor]] in 1999. An independent [[geometric modeling kernel]] has been evolving in Russia since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''DCMU''' ('''3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea''') is an [[algicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/diuron.html | title = Diuron Data Sheet }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[herbicide]] of the aryl[[ureas|urea]] class that inhibits [[photosynthesis]]. It was introduced by [[Bayer]] in 1954 under the trade name of '''Diuron'''.

==Mechanism of action==
DCMU is a very specific and sensitive inhibitor of photosynthesis. It blocks the [[plastoquinone]] binding site of [[photosystem II]], disallowing the electron flow from where it is generated, in photosystem II, to plastoquinone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-5793(86)80911-5 | title = Evidence for a dual function of the herbicide-binding D1 protein in photosystem II | year = 1986 | last1 = Metz | first1 = J | last2 = Pakrasi | first2 = H | last3 = Seibert | first3 = M | last4 = Arntzer | first4 = C | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 205 | issue = 2 | pages = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interrupts the photosynthetic [[electron transport chain]] in photosynthesis and thus reduces the ability of the plant to turn light energy into chemical energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[reductant|reductant potential]]).

DCMU only blocks electron flow from photosystem II, it has no effect on photosystem I or other reactions in photosynthesis, such as light absorption or carbon fixation in the [[Calvin cycle]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2014}}

However, because it absorbs electrons [[oxidized]] from water in [[PS II]], the electron "hole" of [[PS I]] cannot be satisfied, effectively shutting down "linear" photosynthesis by blocking the reduction of [[NADP|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to NADPH.
At the same time, it was found that DCMU not only does not inhibit the [[Photophosphorylation#Cyclic photophosphorylation|cyclic photosynthetic pathway]], but, under certain circumstances, actually stimulates it.&lt;ref&gt;HUBER, S.C. EDWARDS, G.E. (1976), Studies on the Pathway of Cyclic Electron Flow in Mesophyll Chloroplasts of a C4 Plant, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics, Volume 449, Issue 3, 6 December 1976, Pages 420-433, {{doi|10.1016/0005-2728(76)90153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc =  1056483 | pmid=16665372 | volume=83 | issue=4 | title=Regulation of Cyclic Photophosphorylation during Ferredoxin-Mediated Electron Transport : Effect of DCMU and the NADPH/NADP Ratio |date=April 1987 | journal=Plant Physiol. | pages=965–9 | doi=10.1104/pp.83.4.965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these effects, DCMU is often used to study energy flow in [[photosynthesis]].

'''De-categorialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''de-categorialisation''') in [[linguistics]], refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place (according to [[Paul Hopper]]). The other four are [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], and [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]].

De-categorialization can be described as the loss of [[morphosyntactic]] properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Ecosharing''' is an environmental ethic for people to live by: that their own impact on the Earth’s [[biosphere]] be limited to no more than their own fair ecoshare. The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his ''Living in the Environment'' text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jr., G. Tyler ''Living in the Environment'' CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 book ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' sought to quantify an "ecoshare" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectworldview.org/comingofage.htm Cook, Stephen P. and Meadows, Donella H. ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' AR: Parthenon Books, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's [[carbon footprint]]. However it is gauged, an ecoshare is determined by overall assessment of the human impact on the biosphere, computer models of its future condition, and necessary limits imposed by [[sustainability]] criteria.

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fry, ''Design in the Borderlands'' (2014) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Translation and Interpreting''' (FTI) is a faculty of the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland.

== Introduction ==
[[File:UniMail-batiment-claire.jpg|thumb|The FTI is located on the sixth floor of the University of Geneva’s Uni Mail building.]]

The Faculty of Translation and Interpreting (FTI) is one of the oldest translation and interpreting education and research institutions in the world.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claude-Namy1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHStrad"/&gt; It was founded in 1941, by Antoine Velleman, as the Ecole d’interprètes de Genève (EIG).&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiba-Francesca1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanHoof-Henri1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Millan-Carmen1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velleman-Antoine1943" /&gt; When a translation degree was introduced in 1972,&lt;ref name="Namy-Claude1973-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis-Truffaut1991"/&gt; it became the École de traduction et d’interprétation (School of Translation and Interpreting - ETI), before adopting its current title – Faculty of Translation and Interpreting – in 2011.

{{Quote|text="Mr. Velleman was more than qualified to set up and direct the school, which he predicted would expand rapidly as Switzerland prepared itself for post-war recovery. Furthermore, Geneva, with its tradition of international collaboration, offered plenty of advantages to successfully bring about such a project. Before the Second World War, only one other school of its kind existed – a school that was founded in 1930 in Mannheim by Swiss professor Dr. Charles Glauser and was attached to the University of Heidelberg in 1936."|author=S. Stelling-Michaud|title=L’École d’interprètes de 1941 à 1956.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959" /&gt;}}

Initially a part of the Faculty of Humanities, the EIG broke away from the Faculty between 1953-1955, and eventually became an independent institution of the [[University of Geneva|university]].&lt;ref name="Geisendorf"/&gt;{{sfn|Martin|1958|p=296}} Today, the FTI has over a hundred teachers and researchers.&lt;ref name="Corps-academique2015"/&gt;

== Location ==
Up until 1946, the school’s administrative offices were located in Antoine Velleman’s office at 5 Avenue Marc-Monnier,{{sfn|Capel Esteve|Chazal|2010}} then in an apartment at 4 Rue Saint-Victor. Three rooms and the hallway were used for the school, while three other rooms were reserved for administrative purposes.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud318"/&gt; From 1952–1953, the University was renovated and the school’s administrative offices were set up on the former premises of the physics institute (ground floor).&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud318"/&gt; In 1978, the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Genève building at 19 Place des Augustins. It then moved to the new Uni Mail building at 40 Boulevard du Pont-d'Arve in 1992.{{sfn|Capel Esteve|Chazal|2010}}

== Resources and services ==
Students have access to [[IT]] and audiovisual resources, as well as a library specialized in [[translation studies]], [[translation]] (theory, history, education, etc.), [[language interpretation|consecutive and simultaneous interpreting]], [[sign language]] interpreting, [[computational linguistics]], [[terminology]] and [[lexicology]].

=== Library ===
The FTI library is located on the second floor of Uni-Mail. Students can consult and take out books on subjects taught at the FTI, specialized and language dictionaries, and journals.{{sfn|Duret|1998a|p=4}} Since 1984, the library has been a part of [[RERO (Réseau romand)|RERO]], a network of libraries in Western Switzerland.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=34}} It uses the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]].{{sfn|Duret|1998a|p=4}}

The first FTI library was made up of Antoine Velleman’s own personal collection of works, which he kept in his office on Avenue Marc-Monnier and would lend out to students.

{{Quote|text="Antoine Velleman made his library available to the first students, who – with much emotion – recall learning things from dictionaries, books and journals annotated in Velleman’s own hand. For years, there was no one there in that room… We had the key to the library (several of us were almost always gathered around the table), no one monitored us. And I don’t think many of those books disappeared…"|author=Gérard Ilg|title=cited in Duret.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|pp=11-12}}}}

In 1953, a room in the basement of the Bastions building on Rue de Candolle was converted into a library.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=21}}{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=11}} The library truly became specialized, providing access to a collection of dictionaries (monolingual, bilingual, technical) and documents on the [[International Organizations]].{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=21}} When the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Genève building in 1978, the library was equipped with computers, cassette tapes containing interpreting exercises and CD-ROMs.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=34}}

=== Simultaneous interpreting ===
Antoine Velleman was not in favour of simultaneous interpreting and so, initially, only consecutive interpreting classes were offered by the school. Graduates of the programme took it upon themselves to organize simultaneous interpreting training sessions in the evenings. The school’s alumni association (AAEDEI) contacted [[International Business Machines|IBM]] to set up an interpreting booth. The training sessions took place in a room rented on the ground floor of a Methodist church at 12 Rue Calvin. Sessions took place regularly from 1947 onwards. Each participant had to pay three francs per session in order to cover the cost of constructing the booth and renting the room. It was not until 1950 that the first simultaneous interpreting classes were officially offered at the school by Serge Gloor.{{sfn|Rumprecht|2008}}

In 1952, the school acquired simultaneous interpreting equipment, thanks to a donation from IBM. On 4 February 1953, a new simultaneous interpreting training room was inaugurated in the basement of Uni Bastions.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=15}} The room was equipped with ten booths and a control box, which was integrated into the teacher’s desk, allowing the teacher to monitor each booth.

Today, the Faculty has a virtual teaching platform that allows simultaneous interpreting to be taught at a distance. The application gives users access to digitized [[Public speaking|speeches]], a [[Internet forum|forum]], a [[Online chat|chat]] system and a space for teachers to give feedback to students. Students can listen back to the original speech as well as their interpretation of it.{{sfn|Moussadek|2007}}

== FTI Programmes ==
The Faculty offers the following programmes: [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Multilingual Communication, [[Master of Arts]] in Translation, Master of Arts in Conference Interpreting,&lt;ref name="bestFTI"&gt;Graduates of the FTI are among the best interpreters in the world, according to an article in The Monocle Forecast,  {{citation |language=en |issue=43 |author=Ed Stocker |title=Strong Language |periodical=The Monocle Forecast |year=2016 |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary Certificate in Translation.&lt;ref name="FTI2015formations"/&gt; Students make up their language combination based on the languages offered by the Faculty, which are [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

Besides translation and conference interpreting, the programmes offered by the Faculty can lead to careers in [[Wikipedia:Multilingual communication|multilingual communication]], [[public relations]], the [[mass media|media]], [[public administration]], [[tourism]], the [[court]] system, language mediation services, [[education]] and [[research]].

== Exchange programmes ==
The FTI has exchange agreements with 70 universities in over 20 countries.&lt;ref name="FTImobility2015"/&gt;

== Research ==
In the first few years of its existence, the school was mostly geared towards professional training,&lt;ref name="Marcacci"/&gt; but today, it carries out research in a variety of different fields.

Many types of '''fish migrate''' on a regular basis, on time scales ranging from daily to annually or longer, and over distances ranging from a few metres to thousands of kilometres.  
[[Fish]] usually [[animal migration|migrate]] to feed or to reproduce, but in other cases the reasons are unclear.

Migrations involve the fish  moving from one part of a water body to another on a regular basis. Some particular types of migration are anadromous, in which adult fish live in the sea and migrate into fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]], and catadromous, in which adult fish live in fresh water and migrate into salt water to spawn.

Marine [[forage fish]] often make large migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Movements are associated with ocean currents and with the availability of food in different areas at different times of year. The migratory movements may partly be linked to the fact that the fish cannot identify their own offspring and moving in this way prevents cannibalism. Some species have been described by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] as highly migratory species. These are large [[pelagic]] fish that move in and out of the [[exclusive economic zones]] of different nations, and these are covered differently in the treaty from other fish.

[[Salmon]] and [[striped bass]] are well-known anadromous fish, and freshwater [[eel]]s are catadromous fish that make large migrations. The [[bull shark]] is an [[euryhaline]] species that moves at will from fresh to salt water, and many marine fish make a [[diel vertical migration]], rising to the surface to feed at night and sinking to lower layers of the ocean by day. Some fish such as [[tuna]] move to the north and south at different times of year following temperature gradients. The patterns of migration are of great interest to the fishing industry. Movements of fish in fresh water also occur; often the fish swim upriver to spawn, and these traditional movements are increasingly being disrupted by the building of dams.

==Classification==

Updated: 13 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As with various other aspects of fish life, zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations.&lt;ref name="Secor 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Secor |first=David H|author2=Kerr L A|title=Lexicon of life cycle diversity in diadromous and other fishes.|journal=Am. Fish. Soc. Symp.|year=2009|issue=69|pages=537–556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage:
* '''''Anadromous''''' fish migrate from the sea up (Greek: ἀνά ''ana'', "up" and δρόμος ''dromos'', "course") into fresh water to spawn, such as [[salmon]], [[striped bass]],&lt;ref name="Moyle, P.B 2004"&gt;Moyle, P.B. 2004. ''Fishes: An Introduction to Ichthyology''. Pearson Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sea lamprey]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Araújo, M. J., Bao, M., Mucientes, G., &amp; Cobo, F. (2014). The haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus: low host selectivity and wide range of habitats. Hydrobiologia, 734(1), 187-199.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Catadromous''''' fish migrate from fresh water down (Greek: κατά ''kata'', "down" and δρόμος ''dromos'', "course") into the sea to spawn, such as [[eel]]s&lt;ref name="Moyle, P.B 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyus, H.M. 2012. ''Ecology and Conservation of Fishes''. Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, Boca Raton, London, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1949 journal article, George S. Myers coined the inclusive term '''''diadromous''''' to refer to all fishes that migrate between the sea and fresh water. Like the two well known terms, it was formed from classical Greek ([''dia''], "through"; and [''dromous''], "running"). ''Diadromous'' proved a useful word, but terms proposed by Myers for other types of diadromous fishes did not catch on. These included ''amphidromous'' (fishes that migrate from fresh water to the seas, or vice versa, but not for the purpose of breeding), ''potamodromous'' (fishes whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water), and ''oceanodromous'' (fishes that live and migrate wholly in the sea).&lt;ref name="Secor 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers 1949"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=George S.|title=Usage of Anadromous, Catadromous and allied terms for migratory fishes|journal=Copeia|year=1949|volume=1949|pages=89–97|doi=10.2307/1438482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these classifications were originated for fishes, they are, in principle, applicable to any aquatic organism.

==Forage fish==
[[Image:Capelin-iceland.svg|thumb|right|Migration of Icelandic [[capelin]]]]
{{see also|Sardine run}}

[[Forage fish]] often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern [[Norway]],  their feeding ground in [[Iceland]], and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.

[[Capelin]] are a forage fish of the [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] family found in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of [[plankton]] at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat [[krill]] and other [[crustacean]]s. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and [[Jan Mayen]]. The migration is affected by [[ocean current]]s. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.

The diagram on the right shows the main [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] grounds and [[larval]] drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red.

In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Barbaro1 A, Einarsson B, Birnir1 B, Sigurðsson S, Valdimarsson S, Pálsson ÓK, Sveinbjörnsson S and Sigurðsson P (2009)  [http://escholarship.ucop.edu/uc/item/1jv6n689.pdf "Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish"] ''Journal of Marine Science'', '''66'''(5):826-838.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highly migratory species==
[[File:internationalwaters.png|right|thumb|The [[high seas]], highlighted in blue, are the seas which are outside the 200 mile [[exclusive economic zone]]s]]
{{See also|Straddling stock|Bonn Convention}}

The term '''highly migratory species''' (HMS) has its origins in Article 64 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). The Convention does not provide an operational definition of the term, but in an annex (UNCLOS Annex 1) lists the species considered highly migratory by parties to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations]] Convention on the [[Law of the Sea]]:  [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm Text]&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes: [[tuna]] and tuna-like species ([[Albacore tuna|albacore]], [[Bluefin tuna|bluefin]], [[bigeye tuna]], [[Skipjack tuna|skipjack]], [[Yellowfin tuna|yellowfin]], [[Blackfin tuna|blackfin]], [[Euthynnus alletteratus|little tunny]], [[Southern bluefin tuna|southern bluefin]] and [[Auxis rochei|bullet]]), [[Bramidae|pomfret]], [[marlin]], [[sailfish]], [[swordfish]], [[saury]] and  oceangoing [[shark]]s, [[dolphin]]s and other [[cetacean]]s.

These high [[trophic level]] oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding, often on forage fish, or reproduction, and also have wide geographic distributions. Thus, these species are found both inside the 200 mile [[exclusive economic zone]]s and in the [[high seas]] outside these zones. They are [[Pelagic fish|pelagic]] species, which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor, although they may spend part of their life cycle in [[nearshore waters]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pacific Fishery Management Council]]: [http://www.pcouncil.org/highly-migratory-species/background/  Background:  Highly Migratory Species]&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly migratory species can be compared with [[straddling stock]] and [[transboundary stock]]. Straddling stock range both within an [[EEZ]] as well as in the [[high seas]]. Transboundary stock range in the EEZs of at least two countries. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.&lt;ref name="FAO 2007"&gt;[[FAO]] (2007) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/i0150e/i0150e00.pdf Report of the FAO workshop on vulnerable ecosystems and destructive fishing in deep sea fisheries] Rome, Fisheries Report No. 829.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
{{see also|Salmon run|Vertical migration|Lessepsian migration}}

Some of the best-known anadromous fishes are the [[Pacific salmon]] species, such as [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] (king), [[Coho salmon|coho]] (silver), [[Chum salmon|chum]] (dog), [[Pink salmon|pink]] (humpback) and [[Sockeye salmon|sockeye]] (red) salmon.  These salmon hatch in small freshwater streams. From there they migrate to the sea to mature, living there for two to six years. When mature, the salmon return to the same streams where they were hatched to spawn. Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install [[fish ladder]]s in [[dam]]s to enable the salmon to get past. Other examples of anadromous fishes are [[sea trout]], [[three-spined stickleback]], [[sea lamprey]] and &lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Araújo, M. J., Bao, M., Mucientes, G., &amp; Cobo, F. (2014). The haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus: low host selectivity and wide range of habitats. Hydrobiologia, 734(1), 187-199.&lt;/ref&gt; [[shad]].

Several [[Pacific salmon]] ([[Chinook salmon|Chinook]], [[Coho salmon|coho]] and Steelhead) have been introduced into the US Great Lakes, and have become potamodromous, migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water.

[[Image:Lake Washington Ship Canal Fish Ladder pamphlet - life cycle chart.jpg|thumb|right|Life cycle of anadromous fish. From a U.S. Government pamphlet. (Click image to enlarge.)]]
The most remarkable catadromous fishes are freshwater [[eel]]s of genus ''[[Anguilla (genus)|Anguilla]]'', whose larvae drift from spawning grounds in the [[Sargasso sea]], sometimes for months or years, before entering freshwater river and streams as glass eels or elvers (see ''[[eel life history]]'').

An example of a [[euryhaline]] species is the [[bull shark]], which lives in [[Lake Nicaragua]] of Central America and the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] of Africa. Both these habitats are fresh water, yet bull sharks will also migrate to and from the ocean. Specifically, Lake Nicaragua bull sharks migrate to the Atlantic Ocean and Zambezi bull sharks migrate to the Indian Ocean.

[[Diel vertical migration]] is a common behavior; many marine species move to the surface at night to feed, then return to the depths during daytime.

A number of large marine fishes, such as the [[tuna]], migrate north and south annually, following temperature variations in the ocean. These are of great importance to [[fishery|fisheries]].

Freshwater (potamodromous) fish migrations are usually shorter, typically from lake to stream or vice versa, for spawning purposes. However, potamodromous migrations of the endangered Colorado [[pikeminnow]] of the Colorado River system can be extensive. Migrations to natal spawning grounds easily be 100&amp;nbsp;km, with maximum distances of 300&amp;nbsp;km reported from radiotagging studies.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, M.C., and E. Baras. (2001) ''Migration of freshwater fishes''. Blackwell Science Ltd., Malden, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado pikeminnow migrations also display a high degree of homing and the fish may make upstream or downstream 
migrations to reach very specific spawning locations in whitewater canyons.&lt;ref&gt;Tyus, H.M. 2012. Ecology and conservation of fishes. Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, Boca Raton, London, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic exploitation==
Since [[prehistoric]] times humans have exploited certain anadromous fishes during their migrations into freshwater streams, when they are more vulnerable to capture. Societies dating to the [[Millingstone Horizon]] are known which exploited the anadromous fishery of [[Morro Creek]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]] [[Estuary|estuaries]]. In [[Nevada]] the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] tribe has harvested migrating [[Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi|Lahontan cutthroat trout]] along the [[Truckee River]] since prehistoric times. This fishing practice continues to current times, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has supported research to assure the water quality in the Truckee can support suitable populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout.

[[File:Amplifier Compression.gif|thumb|Power transfer curves for an amplifier with a gain of 3 (4.77&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]). The green curve represents an ideal amplifier, in which the output power is equal to 3 times the input power. The red curve represents a typical amplifier, which can deliver the gain only up to a certain power level before it hits saturation. Gain compression is the difference between the green curve and the red curve.]]

'''Gain compression''' is a reduction in "differential" or "slope" gain caused by [[nonlinearity]] of the [[transfer function]] of the amplifying device. This nonlinearity may be caused by heat due to power dissipation or by [[overdrive (music)|overdriving]] the active device beyond its [[linear]] region. It is a ''[[Large-signal model|large-signal]]'' phenomenon of circuits.

== Relevance ==
[[Gain (electronics)|Gain]] compression is relevant in any system with a wide dynamic range, such as audio or [[Radio frequency|RF]].  It is more common in [[vacuum tube|tube]] circuits than [[transistor]] circuits, due to topology differences, possibly causing the differences in audio performance called "[[Tube sound|valve sound]]". The front-end RF [[amplifier|amps]] of [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]s are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon when overloaded by a strong unwanted signal.

== Audio effects ==

A tube radio or tube amplifier will increase in volume to a point, and then as the input signal extends beyond the [[linear]] range of the device, the effective gain is reduced, altering the shape of the waveform.  The effect is also present in transistor circuits.  The extent of the effect depends on the topology of the amplifier.

== Differences between clipping and compression ==

Clipping, as a form of signal compression, differs from the operation of the typical studio [[audio level compression|audio level compressor]], in which gain compression is not instantaneous (delayed in time via attack and release settings). 

Clipping destroys any audio information which is over a certain threshold. Compression and limiting change the shape of the entire waveform, not just the shape of the waveform above the threshold. This is why it is possible to limit and compress with very high ratios without causing distortion.

=== Limiting or clipping ===

Gain is a linear operation. "Gain compression" is not linear and, as such, its effect is one of distortion, due to the [[nonlinearity]] of the transfer characteristic which also causes a loss of 'slope' or 'differential' gain. So the output is less than expected using the ''[[small signal model|small signal]]'' gain of the amplifier. 

In [[Clipping_(audio)|clipping]], the signal is abruptly limited to a certain amplitude and is thereby distorted in keeping under that level. This creates extra harmonics that are not present in the original signal. 

"Soft" clipping or limiting  means there isn't a sharp "knee point" in the transfer characteristic. A [[sine wave]] that has been softly clipped will become more like a [[square wave]], with more rounded edges, but will still [[harmonic distortion|have many extra harmonics]].

=== Compression ===
Compression of gain is caused by non-linear characteristics of the device when run at large amplitudes.  With any signal, as the input level is increased beyond the linear range of the amplifier, gain compression will occur. 

A transistor's operating point may move with temperature, so higher power output may lead to compression due to collector dissipation. But it's not a change in gain; it's non-linear distortion. The output level stays relatively the same as the input level goes higher. Once the [[nonlinearity|non-linear]] portion of the transfer characteristic of any amplifier is reached, any increase in input will not be matched by a proportional increase in output. Thus there is compression of gain.  Also, at this time because the transfer function is no longer linear, [[harmonic distortion]] will result.

==== Intentional compression ====
In intentional compression (sometimes called [[automatic gain control]] or [[audio level compression]]) as used in devices called 'dynamic range compressors', the overall gain of the circuit is actively changed in response to the level of the input over time, so the transfer function remains linear over a short period of time. A sine wave into such a system will still look like a sine wave at the output, but the overall gain is varied, depending on the level of that sine wave. Above a certain input level, the output sine wave will always be the same amplitude. The output level of Intentional compression varies over time, in order to minimize non linear behavior. With gain compression, the opposite is true, its output is constant. In this respect intentional compression serves less of an artistic purpose.

== Radio-frequency compression ==

"Gain compression" in RF amplifiers is similar to soft clipping. However, in [[narrowband]] systems, the effect "looks" more like gain compression simply because the harmonics are filtered out after amplification. Many [[data sheet]]s for RF amplifiers list gain compression rather than distortion figures because it's easier to measure and is more important than distortion figures in nonlinear RF amplifiers.

In [[wideband]] and low-[[frequency]] systems, the nonlinear effects are readily visible, e.g. the output is [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipped]]. To see the same thing at 1&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]], an [[oscilloscope]] with a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of at least 10&amp;nbsp;GHz is needed. Observing with a [[spectrum analyzer]], the fundamental compressed and the [[harmonic]]s picking up. 

=== Examples of RF compression ===

A low-noise [[linear amplifier|RF amplifier]], if fed by a [[directional antenna]] to a consumer 900&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]] receiver, should improve the transmission range. It works, but the receiver may also pick up a couple of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations around 700&amp;nbsp;MHz.
 
For example, if channel 54 is transmitting 6&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] of [[Amplitude modulation|AM]], [[Frequency modulation|FM]], and [[Phase modulation|PM]], the RF front end, expecting −80&amp;nbsp;[[dBm]], would be grossly overloaded and generate mixing products. This is a typical effect of gain compression.

== High-power loudspeakers ==

A form of gain compression also takes place in [[loudspeaker]] [[voice coil]]s when they heat up and increase their [[electrical resistance|resistance]]. This causes less [[power (physics)|power]] to be drawn from the amplifier and a reduction in [[sound pressure level]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Geomessaging''' is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/ITST.2012.6425228|title=2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications|pages=497–501|year=2012|last1=Fujioka|first1=Masanobu|last2=Takahashi|first2=Masanori|last3=Matsumura|first3=Takeshi|last4=Chunmeng Wang|last5=Hirakoba|first5=Hiroyuki|isbn=978-1-4673-3070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions can be created by using [[Geo-fence|geofences]], based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device  will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).

Rules can be: The minimum time to wait before resending a message, weekday, time range, etc.

The content of the message associated to those rules can be any images, text, html, metadata key-value pair, etc.

Increasingly geomessaging is finding its use in various applications including crisis communication and geo-location sensitive communication management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-events-venue.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Events and Venue Crisis and Incident Management |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomessage Media==
Geomessage Media defines a [[Media (communication)|media]] genre where information or messages can be sent to recipients based on their location. Platforms that enable geo-notifications to a defined [[geo-fence]] would fall into the category of Geomessage Media. A geo-fence is a virtual radius or polygon defined by longitude and latitude coordinates on a map. Geofences are being used for a vast array of applications and services like reminder applications based on area, location sharing and localized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loyola L, Wong F, Pereira D ''et al.''|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems - MobiGIS '13|pages=51–58|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534193|publisher=MobiGIS13| date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|doi=10.1145/2534190.2534193|isbn=9781450325318|chapter=Extending battery lifetime of mobile devices with geofence capabilities on dynamic-speed urban environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomessage Media is a natural progression of information sent on Mass Media and Social Media. Geomessage Media platforms allow communicating or sending a geomessage to a hyper-local area. This allows for much more relevant, geo-contextual information to be sent. In some use cases the platforms allow messaging to an anonymised group, in a defined geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shephertz.com/2016/05/05/geo-fencing-push-notifications-next-step-user-engagement |title=Geo-fencing in Push Notifications: The Next Step in User Engagement |publisher=ShepHertz |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other use cases include sending messages to a geolocation where members of a known group may enter. 

Circumstances where a Geomessage would benefit recipients are many, for example:
* Evacuations – instructions can be given to a localised area or areas to evacuate
* Transport Management - Commuters can be sent advice and information that may delay their commute
* Weather – recipients in the path of a weather event can be notified
* Place of Interest – people entering, exiting or even dwelling in a place could be sent a message.

'''Hellenistic glass ''' was [[glass]] produced during the [[Hellenistic period]], from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BC) to the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] (second half of the 1st century BC - 476) in the Mediterranean, Europe, western Asia and northern Africa. Glassmaking at this time was based on the technological traditions of the [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Late Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1981; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; but was marked by  transition from limited production of luxury objects made for the social elite to mass production of affordable glass vessels used by the broader public to satisfy everyday needs.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979; Grose 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of translucent and transparent glass, attempts were made to mimic precious and semi-precious stones, as well as [[Quartz|rock crystal]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1210 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Glass unguentaria, ca. 150 AD - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 20.jpg|thumb|Glass unguentaria]]
{{further information|Hellenistic art}}
Core-formed glass vessels produced in the Mediterranean from 1525 to 50 BC were the most numerous and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Core-formed vessels were generally small in size,  [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]  and designed to store perfumes, scented oils and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The most common shapes were [[alabastra]], [[amphoriskoi]], [[aryballoi]] and lentoid aryballoi, [[oinochoai]] (jugs), and for the first time in the Hellenistic period [[hudriskai]] (three-handled flasks) and [[unguentaria]] (unguent bottles).&lt;ref&gt;Fossing 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpg|thumb|A Greek glass [[amphora]], 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from [[Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]], now in the [[Altes Museum]]]]
During the second half of the 3rd century BC, mosaic glass, also known as '[[millefiori]]', literally, a thousand flowers, emerged. The group consists mostly of fused and slumped broad plates and shallow dishes with upright or out-splayed rims or hemispherical bowls. Sub-groups of mosaic glass production are 'network' or 'lacework' hemispherical bowls and vessels with meandering or spiral decorative patterns that imitate onyx. Often these bowls had a rim formed of a single ‘network’ cane of spirally twisted threads which gives a 'striped' effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It is best represented in burial contexts from several large tombs in [[Canosa]] di Puglia (ancient Canusium) in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; They are open vessels since they are made with a mould but still opaque, like the widely produced core-formed vessels.

The origins of the mosaic glassworking technique are traced back in the 15th century BC in the Mesopotamian glassmaking centres, such as Tell-al-Rimah, ΄Aqar Qūf and Marlik. Although the mosaic technique at the time was practiced in a desultory way, it is the predecessor of the elaborated mosaic vessels of high quality of the Alexandrian workshops, after the foundation of the city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt in 332 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], which is said to be the main production centre of these vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2nd century BC, monochrome drinking vessels, mainly hemispherical and sub-conical bowls were introduced. They were made in considerable quantities in the Syro-Palestinian coast and were widely traded and exported to several trading centres throughout the Mediterranean. Earlier examples were made of clear greenish, brownish or almost colourless glass, while later on they often had green, amber, blue or wine-purple colour. Usually, they were decorated with linear-cut concentric circles at the bottom or right under the rim either on the inside or the outside (Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004). They were made in an open mould, which is in fact a relatively cheap technique that requires less effort put and it was this that allowed their large-scale production.

Within the production of these drinking vessels, from the mid-2nd century BC onwards, translucent or transparent glass tableware (plates, dishes, bowls, drinking vessels, such as skyphoi, footed bowls or handled cups) was introduced; glass tableware production once established enjoyed several glassworking centres and contributed in the dramatic increase of the Hellenistic glass industry.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that glass vessels were widely consumed by the broader public as a widespread commodity, something that continued ever since and was achieved in a higher degree with the invention of the even more economical [[glassblowing]] technique.

During the 1st century BC, new types of monochrome glass vessels were introduced and ribbed bowls started to be produced. They were mould-press bowls with ribs on the outside and their production centres were concentrated in the [[Levant]] and the Syro-Palestinian coast, like the monochrome hemispherical/conical bowls.

However, the production of luxury glass vessels did not cease and glass vessels imitating precious metal vessels (gold- and silver-ware) were produced with new glassworking techniques to satisfy the needs of the elite social strata market. [[Gold sandwich glass]] vessels and [[gold glass|gold-band]] alabastra were innovations of the late Hellenistic period addressed to a more limited range of wealthy customers. The manufacturing techniques were the same, namely the mould-press and core-form mosaic techniques respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were developed further more in order to achieve a quite elaborate decorative aspect.

==Other glass objects==
Hellenistic glass industry also included a range of other objects, mainly for decorative purposes. The broadest groups of glass objects were these of glass beads and [[inlays]], like in all periods since the introduction of glassmaking in the ancient world. The mass production of glass beads of many varieties is well represented in the context of a Hellenistic glass workshop in Rhodes, where 10,000 beads of 40 different shapes and colours have been found;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triantafyllidis 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Rings, pendants, gemstones, amulets, small sculptures were also made with the mould-casting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlays were produced to decorate wooden articles, furniture, chests, sarcophagi and jewellery in combination with other, often precious materials, such as gold leaf or ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt; For example, glass inlays decorated the ionic capitals of north porch of the Erechtheion in the Athenian Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Inlays were deeply rooted in the Egyptian glassmaking industry and their production, with the mosaic technique after the Pharaonic tradition, continued to flourish during the Hellenistic period with old or new repertories inspired from the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Game counters and gaming pieces were made also as one way to recycle scrap glass left over from the manufacture of other articles.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in many other occasions, these objects are well represented and archaeologically found along with various types of glass vessels in rich burial contexts, e.g. this of Amphipolis.&lt;ref&gt;Romiopoulou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary production centres==
Glassmaking and glassworking were considered two totally separate crafts and took place in different regions (Grose 1981). Each craft was characterized by its own technological tradition, know-how and equipment. Glassmakers and glassworkers did not need to have an understanding of glass vessel manufacture and primary production respectively, in order to carry out their tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Glassmaking had to take place as close as possible to the sources of the raw materials used, namely sand and mineral [[natron]]  when it comes to the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Raw glass was traded throughout the Mediterranean in the form of ingots (Stern 1999) and it was then worked and shaped into vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., in numerous sites of the Hellenistic world.

Hellenistic glass is the typical '''soda-lime-silica glass''', to which lime was not intentionally added, but it was provided through the agent of sand.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956a&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it cannot be argued with certainty where the Hellenistic primary production of raw glass was geographically located from the archaeological record, we can hypothesize that a large part of glass production took place in the Syro-Palestinian coast or the broader Levant and Egypt . In favor of this argument are comments of classical writers of the period or a little later, like Strabo (63 BC) who mentioned the [[Belus River|Belus]] river on the Syrian coast to have been used for glassmaking or even by writers other such as [[Pliny the Elder]] (23-79 AD) or [[Tacitus]] (c. 56-c. 117 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956b&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological evidence firmly indicate that primary production of glass, as well as glassworking took place on the island of [[Rhodes]] in the Aegean, during the [[Hellenistic period]] and, particularly, after the foundation of the city of Rhodes in 408 BC, and even earlier through the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983; Triantafyllidis 1998; Rehren 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial distribution==
Glassworking took place in several centres of the Hellenistic world. Raw glass was brought to glassworkers in the form of ingots, except from the Rhodian workshop which included both glassmaking and glassworking, and in turn they produced glass vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., which were then widely traded. Although most probably core-formed vessels were traded for their content, mosaic or monochrome and transparent tableware were traded per se.

Major glassworking centres were located at the Syro-Palestinian coast, e.g. monochrome hemispherical bowls, and in [[Alexandria]], since its foundation in 332 BC, e.g. mosaic glass vessels and inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of the Alexandrian workshop is well understood from luxury glass vessels decorated with Egyptian-style buildings or characteristic scenes found as far as Italy and Afghanistan or, even, produced there (Auth 2001). Glass vessels, both core-formed and mould-press, were also made in Ionia, Cyprus, Sidon, the Levant, [[Tel Anafa]] in [[Upper Galilee]], Rome and Roman Italy, Crete, Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Ignatiadou 2002; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly interesting is the core-formed vessels’ trade and spatial distribution, since this was the group produced throughout the Hellenistic period from its very beginning to the invention of [[glassblowing]] (c. 50 BC). Core-formed bottles, along with other types of glass vessels, are found throughout the Mediterranean in the Aegean (e.g. Delos, Crete, Athens), throughout Greece, Asia Minor and western Asia (e.g. Ephesus, Sardis, Dura-Europos, Babylon, Nimrud, Nineveh, the Levant, Phoenicia), Magna Greacia (e.g. Rhegium, Morgantina) and Italy, Mesopotamia, the Balkans, Russia, the transalpine lands, Spain (Emporion) and the Balearics, northern Africa (Carthage) and Cerne on the Atlantic coast of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1956; Harden 1969; Harden 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Glass production of vessels or other glass objects was mainly of two distinct technological traditions, these of core-formed glass and mould-press or cast glass (Grose 1981).
* ''Core-formed glass'': is the best represented and probably the earliest manufacturing technique applied. First, a core with the bottle’s shape was shaped around a metallic rod most probably by a combination of clay, sand, mud and/or animal dung. Then, molten glass was either trailed onto the core with the aid of a second tool or directly from dipping it into a container of molten glass. The surface was smoothed by continual re-heating and rolling on a flat slab. Finally, vessels were removed from the metallic rod, they slowly cooled down in a side chamber of the [[glass melting furnace]] and, then, the core material was scraped out of the interior. Common body colours were translucent dark or cobalt blue, opaque white, brown, red or olive-green and of the decoration opaque yellow, orange, white or turquoise trails in zigzag or feather patterns. This technique limited considerably the size of the vessels, which were mainly close vessels with thick walls.
* ''Mould-press or cast glass'': it was first practiced by the Hellenistic glassworkers from the 3rd century BC onwards. Although different decorative results were achieved by variations in colours, the technique was virtually the same for ''mosaic, monochrome hemispherical bowls, transparent tableware and gold-sandwich vessels'', both luxurious fine ware and more affordable types. Mould-press or cast vessels were mainly open bowls, shallow dishes and jars, but some closed vessels were produced as well. They were made from a single mould on which a piece of glass was [[slumping|slumped]].
* Mosaic glass: vessels, namely bowls and plates, as well as inlays were produced with the mosaic technique. A multicoloured effect is achieved as a result of a variety of diverse cane configurations and colour combinations fused together and then slumped on an open mould.
* Network: a type of mosaic glass made of canes of spirally twisted glass threads of different colours laid side by side.
* Gold-sandwich glass: also found for the first time during the Hellenistic period. It technique consists of a ‘sandwich’ of two [[decolorized glass]] layers which enclose a sheet of gold leaf between them. The vessels were formed of two castings and they were carefully ground and polished.
* Cold-cutting: grinding and polishing by the application of stone-cutting techniques and by using harder materials, such us [[quartz]]. It was used as a supplementary technique to other processes as finishing and decoration.

{{Sexual orientation}}
The '''heterosexual–homosexual continuum''' or the '''sexual orientation continuum''' is a psychological and philosophical understanding of human sexuality that places [[sexual orientation]] on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] [[spectrum]] from [[heterosexuality]] to [[homosexual orientation|homosexuality]], with sexuality ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.

This concept stems from [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s 1940s surveys of sexuality; significant numbers of Kinsey's subjects reported [[bisexuality]] of varying degrees, rather than the strict heterosexual/homosexual division that had been previously assumed. This work was expanded by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]], who hypothesized that sexual orientation was a dynamic, multi-variable process, involving [[Attractiveness|attraction]], [[behavior]], [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]], emotional and [[social preferences]], [[self-identification]], and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="uis"&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |title=Continuum of Human Sexuality |publisher=University of Illinois, Springfield |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110091528/http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum was an important influence on the [[feminism|feminist]] and [[LGBT social movements|gay-rights]] movements of the 1970s and 1980s as academics and movement leaders tried to distinguish between one's sex—e.g. being male or female—and the social, cultural, and psychological aspects of gender and sexuality.

According to a 2005 statement by the [[American Psychological Association]]:
{{quote|Sexual orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectionate attraction toward others. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, [[gender identity]] (the psychological sense of being male or female), and the social [[gender role]] (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).

Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality to exclusive homosexuality and includes various forms of [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref name=uis /&gt;}}

People who disagree with this interpretation of human sexual orientation are said to believe in a "heterosexual–homosexual dichotomy".&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, Nathaniel. "Heterosexuality/homosexuality: Dichotomy or continuum." Archives of sexual behavior 16.5 (1987): 411-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEEE Std 1584-2002''' (''Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations'') is a standard of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] that provides a method of calculating the incident energy of [[arc flash]] event.

==Purpose==
IEEE 1584-2002 was developed to help protect people from arc-flash hazard dangers. The predicted arc current and incident energy are used in selecting appropriate overcurrent protective devices and [[personal protective equipment]] (generally abbreviated as PPE), as well as defining safe working distance. Since the magnitude of the arc current is inherently linked with the degree of arc hazard, the arc is examined as a circuit parameter. Furthermore, since estimations are often useful, simple equations for predicting ballpark arc current, arc power, and incident energy values and probable ranges are presented in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2943/30100/01380323.pdf?arnumber=1380323 IEEE Xplore - IEEE 1584-2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Arc Flash Hazard calculations are currently implemented in most of the industry plants due to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_calculating_arc_flash here&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEE 1584 [[empirically]] derived model accurately accounts for a wide variety of setup parameters including:

* [[Voltage|Voltages]] in the range of 208 V–15 000 V, three-phase.
* [[Frequency|Frequencies]] of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* Bolted fault current in the range of 700 A – 106,000 A.
* Grounding of all types and ungrounded.
* Equipment enclosures of commonly available sizes.
* Gaps between [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] of 13&amp;nbsp;mm – 152&amp;nbsp;mm.
* Faults involving three phases.

For cases where voltage is over 15kV or gap is outside the range of the model, the theoretically derived Lee method can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcflashanalytic.com/arcflash/ieee1584_procedure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert-subject|Robotics|date=October 2009}}

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''intelligent agent''' ('''IA''') is an [[autonomous]] entity which observes through sensors and acts upon an [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] using actuators (i.e. it is an [[Software agent|agent]]) and directs its activity towards achieving goals (i.e. it is "[[rational choice theory|rational]]", as defined in [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Intelligent agents may also [[machine learning|learn]] or use [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or [[Complexity|very complex]]. A reflex machine, such as a [[thermostat]], is considered an example of an intelligent agent.&lt;ref&gt;According to the definition given by {{harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png|thumb|right|408px|Simple reflex agent]]
Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a [[computer program]]. For this reason, intelligent agents are sometimes called '''abstract intelligent agents''' ('''AIA'''){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} to distinguish them from their real world implementations as computer systems, biological systems, or organizations. Some definitions of intelligent agents emphasize their [[Wiktionary:Autonomy|autonomy]], and so prefer the term '''autonomous intelligent agents'''. Still others (notably {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}}) considered goal-directed behavior as the essence of intelligence and so prefer a term borrowed from [[economics]], "[[rational agent]]".

Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to [[agent (economics)|agent]]s in [[Agent-based computational economics|economics]], and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in [[cognitive science]], [[ethic]]s, the philosophy of [[practical reason]], as well as in many [[interdisciplinary]] [[socio-cognitive]] [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and computer [[social simulation]]s.

Intelligent agents are also closely related to [[software agent]]s (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users). In [[computer science]], the term ''intelligent agent'' may be used to refer to a software agent that has some intelligence, regardless if it is not a rational agent by Russell and Norvig's definition. For example, autonomous programs used for operator assistance or [[data mining]] (sometimes referred to as ''[[bot (disambiguation)|bots]]'') are also called "intelligent agents".

==A variety of definitions==
&lt;!-- Ideally, this should be an accurate survey of all the definitions in use. This requires the editor to have an accurate understanding of which definitions are mainstream and which are obscure. Thus the expert tag. ---&gt;
Intelligent agents have been defined many different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions are examined by {{Harvnb|Franklin|Graesser|1996}} and {{Harvnb|Kasabov|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nikola Kasabov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasabov|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI systems should exhibit the following characteristics:
* Accommodate new [[problem solving]] rules incrementally
* Adapt [[online]] and in [[Real-time computing|real time]]
* Are able to analyze [[self-concept|themselves]] in terms of behavior, error and success.
* Learn and improve through interaction with the environment ([[embodied agent|embodiment]])
* Learn quickly from large amounts of [[data (computing)|data]]
* Have memory-based exemplar [[computer storage|storage]] and retrieval capacities
* Have [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] to represent short and long term memory, age, forgetting, etc.

==Structure of agents==
A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as an [[agent function]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions:
:&lt;math&gt;f : P^\ast \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of [[utility]] of individual options, deduction over logic rules, [[fuzzy logic]], etc.&lt;ref name="Salamon2011"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salamon | first1 = Tomas | title = Design of Agent-Based Models | location = Repin | publisher = Bruckner Publishing | year= 2011 | pages = 42–59 | isbn = 978-80-904661-1-1 | url=http://www.designofagentbasedmodels.info/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[program agent]], instead, maps every possible percept to an action{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.

We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.

==Architectures==
{{Harvtxt|Weiss|2013}} defines four classes of agents:
*Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction;
*Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action;
*Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally,
*Layered architectures – in which decision making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction.

Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators and that operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers if often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poole|first1=David|last2=Mackworth|first2=Alan|title=1.3 Agents Situated in Environments‣ Chapter 2 Agent Architectures and Hierarchical Control‣ Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents, 2nd Edition|url=https://artint.info/2e/html/ArtInt2e.Ch2.S3.html|website=artint.info|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=46–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# model-based reflex agents
# goal-based agents
# utility-based agents
# learning agents

===Simple reflex agents===
Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the ''condition-action rule'': if condition then action.

This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered.

Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. Note: If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops.

===Model-based reflex agents===
A '''model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure which describes the part of the world which cannot''' be seen. This knowledge about "how the world works" is called a model of the world, hence the name "model-based agent".

A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of [[Mental model|internal model]] that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent.

An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;S.V. Albrecht and P. Stone (2018). Autonomous Agents Modelling Other Agents: A Comprehensive Survey and Open Problems.
Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 258, pp. 66-95. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2018.01.002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-based agents===
Goal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using "goal" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This allows the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals.

===Utility-based agents===
Goal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of a ''utility function'' which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow a [[comparison (computer programming)|comparison]] of different world states according to exactly how happy they would make the agent. The term utility can be used to describe how "happy" the agent is.

A rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning.

===Learning agents===
Learning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the "learning element", which is responsible for making improvements, and the "performance element", which is responsible for selecting external actions.

The learning element uses feedback from the "critic" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the future.
The performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent: it takes in percepts and decides on actions.

The last component of the learning agent is the "problem generator". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.

==Hierarchies of agents==
{{Main|Multi-agent system}}

To actively perform their [[function (engineering)|functions]], Intelligent Agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many “sub-agents”. Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence.

== Applications==
[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|200px|An example of an [[automated online assistant]] providing automated customer service on a webpage.]]
Intelligent agents are applied as [[automated online assistant]]s, where they function to perceive the needs of customers in order to perform individualized [[customer service]]. Such an agent may basically consist of a [[dialog system]], an [[avatar (computer)|avatar]], as well an [[expert system]] to provide specific expertise to the user.&lt;ref&gt;''Providing Language Instructor with Artificial Intelligence Assistant''.

The '''International Center for Research on Women''' ('''ICRW''') is a [[non-profit]] organization headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], with a regional office in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. ICRW has project offices in Mumbai and Hyderabad [[India]], and is establishing a formal presence in East Africa. ICRW works to promote [[gender equity|gender equitable]] development within the field of [[international development]].

==Mission==
According to the organization Web site:

{{quote|ICRW's mission is to empower women, advance gender equality and fight poverty in the developing world. To accomplish this, ICRW works with partners to conduct empirical research, build capacity and advocate for evidence-based, practical ways to change policies and programs.}}

==Focus areas==
ICRW research identifies women's contributions to their communities and the barriers – like HIV, violence, and lack of education – that prevent them from being economically stable and able to fully participate in society. It focuses on three paths of action to achieve this:

* Designing concrete, evidence-based plans for program designers, donors and policymakers that empower women to control their lives and help shape the future of their communities
* Measuring changes in the lives of women and girls – as well as men and boys – to know how best to achieve gender equality
* Recommending policy priorities that give women opportunities to transform their lives

Some of its priorities include the economic empowerment of women, the prevention of HIV/[[AIDS]] among women and girls, the elimination of violence against women, the creation of better life options for women and girls, combating [[child marriage]], and increasing food security for vulnerable women.

ICRW is primarily a research institution whose strong quantitative and qualitative research contributes to the direct action of organizations and communities in which they work.

ICRW's tagline is, "ICRW turns insight into action."

==Leadership==
ICRW is led by President Dr. Sarah Degnan Kambou, a social scientist [[Sarah Degnan Kambou]] who was appointed by the board in 2010. Previously Dr. Degnan Kambou served for two years as ICRW's chief operating officer (COO) under former president [[Geeta Rao Gupta]], and then as interim president and COO after Rao Gupta stepped down in April 2010.

Degnan Kambou joined ICRW in 2002. As COO, she led the organization's research and programs, finance and human resources departments as well as ICRW's Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India. Before that, she was vice president of health and development, overseeing research in HIV and AIDS, reproductive health and nutrition as well as in gender, violence and women's rights.

In 2012 President Barack Obama appointed Dr. Degnan Kambou to his [https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/advisory-boards/global-development-council Global Development Council], which advises him and members of his Cabinet on how to improve U.S. foreign assistance. In 2010, Dr. Degnan Kambou was appointed by United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to represent ICRW on the U.S. National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]).

Degnan Kambou holds a doctorate in international health policy and a master's in public health from Boston University. She earned her bachelor's degree in French from the University of Connecticut.

Degnan Kambou is ICRW's fourth president in its 40-year history. [[Ravi Verma]] is the director of ICRW's Asia Regional Office, and Stella Mukasa directs its Africa Regional Office.

==Board of directors==
ICRW has been directed by several renowned and well-recognized individuals within the field of international development as well as other key private sector and government individuals, including Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]], writer [[Ann Crittenden]], and [[Brooke Shearer]] (deceased, May 19, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0509/Brooke_Shearer_RIP.html?showall|title=Brooke Shearer, R.I.P.|author=Ben Smith|work=politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; spouse of [[Strobe Talbott]], director of the [[Brookings Institution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18547">'''Interpersonal (Interaction) adaptation theory''' ('''IAT''') is often referred to as a [[theory]] of theories. Several theories have been developed to provide frameworks as explanations of social interactions. After reviewing and examining various communication theories and previous empirical evidence pertaining to [[interpersonal communication]], a need to address ways in which individuals adapt to one another in interactions became apparent. The importance of observing both sides of a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] interaction lead to the development of the interpersonal adaptation theory. The theory states, individuals enter interactions with [[expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], [[requirements]], and [[desire (emotion)|desires]], which combined establish an interaction position. Once the interaction begins, the difference between interaction position and the other party’s actual behavior determines whether the individual will adapt and continue the communication positively or not. 

== Background ==
In 1995, [[Judee K. Burgoon]], Lesa Stern, and Leesa Dillman published a book titled, ''Interpersonal Adaptation: Dyadic Interaction Patterns'' in which they described their findings on a "new" theory which drew from the results of previous theories.&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgoon1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgoon1993 /&gt; Burgoon and her team examined fifteen previous models and considered the most important conclusions from the previous empirical research. They reviewed theories based in biological, arousal and affect, approach and avoidance, compensation and reciprocity, communication and cognitive, and social norms models. The conclusion after consideration of a multitude of theories and models stated, "while most theories predict a mix of patterns rather than committing to a single dominant pattern, they conflict over which patterns are likely under a given set of conditions."&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;

The theories and the models from which they are derived are include but are not limited to:

* Biologically based models: interacting individuals will exhibit similar behaviors to one another. Patterns presumed to be [[innate]] based on basic needs in bonding, safety, and social organization
**Motor [[Mimicry]] – describes an interaction and how an interactant will mimic another, usually out of empathy, or perceived empathy
**Interactional [[Synchronization|Synchrony]]
**[[Mirroring (psychology)|Mirroring]]

*Arousal-based &amp; affect-based models: internal and emotional states are driving forces in people’s decisions to approach or avoid others
**[[Affiliative Conflict Theory]] (ACT) – Argyle &amp; Dean (1965) – individuals have needs for both [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[autonomy]]&lt;ref name=Argyle /&gt;
**Discrepancy Arousal Theory (DAT) – Cappella &amp; Green (1982) – predicts discrepancies from expected behavior patterns produce arousal change

*Approach &amp; avoidance models: [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]]
**Arousal-Labeling Theory – Patterson (1976) – external factors influence how an individual will react in any given interaction&lt;ref name=Patterson /&gt;

*Social-norm models: out of felt social obligation, individuals will reciprocate the behaviors they receive from others
**[[Norm of reciprocity|Norm of Reciprocity]] – out of social obligation, an individual will respond in the same manner as another
**[[Communication Accommodation Theory]] (CAT) – Gallois et al. (1991) and Giles (1973) – considers the way an individual interacts with another based on the context of the interaction&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt;
**[[Social Exchange Theory]]
**Resource Exchange Theory

*Communication &amp; cognitive based models: communication-related cognitions and behaviors, analyzing the interaction patterns and the meaning behavioral patterns convey
**Sequential Functional Model – explains the stability of interaction and how each interactant accommodates the other

*Combined elements of preceding models:
**[[Expectancy Violations Theory]] (EVT) – Burgoon (1978) – an interaction can be described positively or negatively based on an individual's expectations and the actual behavior of the other person&lt;ref name=Burgoon1978 /&gt;
**[[Cognitive Valence Theory]] (CVT) – Andersen (1985) – describes and explains the process of intimacy exchange within a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] relationship&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;

These previous theories combined with [[empirical evidence]] resulting from Burgoon's and her colleagues' own studies, birthed the interpersonal adaptation theory.&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgoon1997 /&gt;

== Definitions ==
*[[Requirements]] - interactant’s basic human needs and drives; i.e. [[surviving|survival]], safety, comfort, autonomy, affiliation
*[[expectation (epistemic)|Expectations]] - what is anticipated based on [[social norms]], social prescriptions, individuated knowledge of the other’s behavior; i.e. self-presentation, and demands
*[[desire (emotion)|Desires]] - highly personalized, one’s goals, likes, and dislikes
*Interaction Position - a net assessment of what is needed, anticipated, and preferred as the dyadic interaction pattern in a situation
*Actual behavior - partner’s actual performed communicative behavior in an interaction
*[[Convergence (relationship)|Convergence]] – the act of becoming more alike as a relationship progresses. If one interactant identifies and wants to be integrated with another, the first interactant will converge toward the communication behaviors of the other, adapting to rate of speech, volume, pauses, utterances, vocabulary, posture, and/or mode of dress.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;
*[[Divergence]] – the opposite of convergence; becoming more dissimilar. Divergence occurs when interactants try to accentuate communicative differences between themselves and another interactant
*[[Mirroring (psychology)|Mirroring]] – an individual's behavior becomes identical to the other party's behavior; also referred to at matching
*[[Compensation (psychology)|Compensation]] – an individual reacting dissimilar to another individual's response
*[[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]] – an individual will react in a similar way to another individual's reaction
*Maintenance - an individual's communicative behaviors and patterns attempt to maintain stability throughout an interaction

==Basics==
As previously stated, individuals enter interactions with a combination of expectations, requirements, and desires. The individual's expectations refers to how they anticipate the other party will respond in the given interaction. The individual's requirements are based on their biological basic needs. Lastly, the individual's desires are driven by their personalized likes and dislikes.  

For example, when a wife of an [[airman]] comes to her husband after he has hurt her emotionally, because he has not been spending enough time with her before he [[Military deployment|deploys]], she may expect him to behave defensively, need him to not get mad thus spending even less time with her, and want him to understand her feelings. The wife's requirements, expectations, and desires are a combination of biological needs (unconsciously presumed or performed) and socially learned behaviors. Expectations are typically based on previously experienced social interactions or social norms. Requirements, such as the need for safety, may be more prominently based on a [[biological]] need for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]].&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;

In the above example, according to IAT, if the husband responds in a manner which meets his wife's requirements and desires, she will reciprocate and [[Human position|posture]] to mirror his behavior in the interaction. The theory explains, the reason reciprocity occurs, is because a positive and stable interaction is most preferred. 

If in the given example, the husband meets his wife's expectations and behaves unfavorably toward her, her response behavior will diverge, to deescalate the situation. The use of [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] is the most common behavioral response to occur in this interaction. In divergence, the wife may assume a role of the "fire extinguisher" and find herself frequently putting out fires or deescalating negative interactions in the relationship.&lt;ref name=Guerrero /&gt;

Another example of interpersonal adaptation theory may be observed in an international business exchange. Consider the following example, in the United States business meeting culture is conducted in a direct, forward, and opinionated way. American business people engaged in meetings with an agenda and openly voice their ideas and opinions. In contrast, Japanese business culture is formal, polite and conducted at an elevated level of etiquette. In events in which the two cultures engage in business together, the Japanese businessman may expect the American businessman to be direct and opinionated but prefer politeness. If instead the American displays tact and decorum, the interaction will be more positive than had the expectation of the Japanese businessman been met. In this [[Cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural exchange]], the interaction will likely adapt in [[Convergence (relationship)|convergence]] reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Burgoon2005 /&gt;

== Theory ==

The review of past theories, empirical evidence, and considerations of their own investigations, lead [[Burgoon]] (1995) and her colleagues&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt; to propose nine principles meant to guide the new interaction adaption model:

:1. There may be an innate pressure to adapt interaction patterns
::*[[unconscious mind|unconscious]], inborn need to adapt interaction styles

:2. At the biological level, the inherent pressures are toward entrainment and synchrony, with the exception of compensatory adjustments that ensure physical safety and comfort
::*it is advantageous for survival to [[Convergence (relationship)|converge]] and synchronize, except in situations where divergence is essential to deescalate a situation

:3. Approach or avoidance drives are not fixed or constant but cyclical due to satiation at a given pole

:4. At the social level, the pressure is also toward [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and matching

:5. At the communication level, both reciprocity and [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] may occur

:6. Despite predispositions to adapt, the degree of strategic, conscious adaptation present in any situation will be limited due to: 
::a) individual consistency in behavioral style
::b) internal causes of adjustments
::c) poor [[self-monitoring]] or monitoring of the partner 
::d) inability to adjust performance
::e) cultural differences in communication practices and expectations

:7. The combined biological, psychological, and social forces set up boundaries within which most interaction patterns will oscillate, producing largely matching, synchrony, and reciprocity

:8. Many variables may be salient moderators of interaction adaptation.

:9. Predictions about functional complexes of behaviors should be more useful and accurate than predictions about particular behaviors viewed in isolation of the function they serve

Based on the foundation set by the proposed nine guiding principles and the recognized importance of observing both sides of an interaction, the dyadic model of the interaction adaptation theory was created. The interaction adaptation model is derived from five key concepts.

The first three of the five concepts, which govern behavior are [[requirements]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], and [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Individuals engaging in an interaction begin with a combination of the three.

:'''Requirements''' (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) - based on an individual’s basic human needs, or what they feel is needed at the time of an interaction. Requirement factors occur below conscious awareness. 

:'''Expectations''' (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) - based in social factors, influenced by social norms, social prescriptions, and knowledge of the typical behavior of the other interactant. Expectations are anticipated by the context of the interaction. 

:'''Desires''' (&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;) - highly personalized, based on personal goals, likes, and dislikes. Desires are influenced by an individual’s personality, personal social experiences, and culture.

'''R, E, &amp; D''' are interrelated and not independent.

The fourth concept, interaction position, is a product of an individual's requirements, desires, and expectations. 

:'''Interaction Position''' (&lt;math&gt;IP&lt;/math&gt;) - a derivative behavioral predisposition

Burgoon and her colleagues presented the first four concepts in mathematical formula format:

:&lt;math&gt;R + E + D = IP&lt;/math&gt;

'''Understanding R, E, D and IP'''

*'''R, E,''' and '''D''' proscribe certain response options 
*'''R, E,''' and '''D''' are hierarchically ordered – '''IP''' is typically driven by required needs first and so on
*'''Rs''' do not result in a single interaction pattern
*'''Es''' predominate in the equation and lead to strong inclination to match and reciprocate another’s behavior
*'''Ds''' are less likely to be more significant than '''R''' or '''E''' but also lead to matching and reciprocation

The fifth concept is actual behavior which is used as a comparison point against the interaction position.

:'''Actual Behavior''' (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) - partner’s actual performed behavior in an interaction

'''Understanding IP and A'''

*'''IP''' and '''A''' can be placed on a continuum. The discrepancy assessed between the two determines the interaction outcome.
:*Large discrepancies between '''IP''' and '''A''' should activate a) behavioral change, b) cognitive change or c) both

*The goal is to minimize the gap between '''IP''' and '''A''' and align both individual’s behavior with the '''IP''' by prompting a reciprocal response from the partner

:*If an interactant’s '''IP''' matches a partner's '''A''', the interactant will be inclined to match or reciprocate the partner’s behavior
:*If '''IP''' equals '''A''' for both parties, a stable exchange should progress – unless and until the '''IP''' changes for either party
:*If '''A''' is more positively valenced than the '''IP''' (a positive situation), the inclination will be toward [[Convergence (relationship)|convergence]] and [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]]
:*If '''IP''' is more positively valenced than '''A''' (a negative circumstance) the inclination will be toward nonaccommodation, divergence or [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]]

As an alternative explanation of the relationship between the interaction position and actual behavior, a preferred stable interaction is described as one in which IP and A are equal. IAT predicts if at any point, either interactant wants the interaction to continue to be stable and IP does not equal A, one of the interactants much change their IP. This change minimizes the discrepancy gap between IP and A. By changing their IP, the interactant hopes their partner will acknowledge the adjustment by matching the behavior, thus changing A. Burgoon et al., describes this as a "Follow the Leader" entrainment principle. This is a strategic adaptation which was introduced by Ickes et al., in 1982.&lt;ref name=Ickes /&gt;

In summation, interpersonal adaptation theory explains the dyadic interaction as follows, prior to an individual entering an interaction with another individual, their interaction is predisposed with certain expectations, desires, and requirements, or an interaction position. Once the communication begins, the difference between interaction position and the other party’s actual behavior determines whether the individual will adapt and continue the communication positively or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">"'''Joke'''" is a [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] written and performed by [[English people|English]] [[comedian]]s [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. It was performed live during Atkinson's 1980 tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. A live recording was made at the [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on 19 or 20 September 1980 and released as the last track on Atkinson's [[live album|live]] comedy [[album]], ''[[Live in Belfast]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the start of the sketch, Rowan Atkinson's character tells Richard Curtis' character he's "got a [[joke]]". He goes on to explain, "It's one of those ones where I ask a question and you say 'I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot'." Rowan begins the joke by saying, "I say, I say, I say, what is the secret of great comedy?" Richard replies by literally saying, "I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot." After laughing at his own wit, Richard tells the annoyed Rowan that he'll "do it again." Rowan repeats the question and Richard replies, "I don't know. What is the secret to great comedy?" However, before Richard can finish his reply, Rowan interrupts, "timing." The point of the joke is that Rowan deliberately got his timing wrong when saying that timing is the secret to great comedy; however, Richard does not understand the joke. Bewildered by Richard's stupidity, Rowan enquires, "But didn't you see?" "Sorry, was it a visual joke?" Richard replies, still confused. After trying the joke a third time, Richard still does not understand the [[irony]] of the joke. Annoyed by Richard, Rowan asks, "Don't you think that's a clever joke?" to which Richard replies, "Clever... no. Joke... no." Disheartened by his joke falling flat with Richard, he claims "it was very funny when Michael told it," then makes the excuse that his timing might be out to which Richard replies, "It could be other factors like the complete absence of anything funny in the joke." Rowan proclaims, "It's so difficult telling jokes," before suddenly exclaiming that he has another joke that is "far more straightforward" to which Richard replies, "As long as it's funny, I don't mind."

The second joke begins with Rowan saying, "Knock! Knock! Who's there? Death..." but he is interrupted by Richard who complains that [[knock-knock joke]]s "are meant to be two-handers". Rowan argues that this joke "doesn't work that way". It becomes apparent that Rowan is attempting to tell the same joke told by Toby, the [[Devil]], during a previous sketch. The joke is meant to go "Knock, Knock. Who's there? Death. Death wh..." at which point the person telling the joke pretends to die. If a second person was replying in the joke, they would not know to pretend to die when saying "Death who?". Richard protests and Rowan gives in and the pair attempt the knock-knock joke in the "old way". Richard, ignorant to the fact he is meant to say the [[punch line]], replies "Death who?" and Rowan replies "Ah, now, that's where it goes wrong." Rowan explains to Richard how he is meant to say the punch-line but after another attempt at the joke, Richard replies wrong. Rowan, getting increasingly more annoyed as the sketch goes on, says he has another joke and this time he will be "third time lucky".

Rowan explains that the third joke is "a very old joke but a very good joke". Rowan begins to tell the classic joke, which begins "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to [[Jamaica]]". The person replying is meant to say, "Jamaica?" which sounds like "D'you make 'er?" or "Did you make her?". The joke-teller then replies, "No, of her own accord." However, when Rowan says, "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to Jamaica," Richard replies, "Of her own accord?" which ruins the whole joke and causes Rowan to [[profanity|swear]] loudly and give up telling jokes to Richard.

The '''Lab-on-a-Chip Applications Development''' ('''LOCAD''') element is a set of related [[lab-on-a-chip]] projects at [[NASA]]. The projects develop integrated lab-on-a-chip products in three areas related to [[space exploration]]: [[Environmental Control and Life Systems Support]] (ECLSS), Medical Systems, and Remote Exploration. NASA conducts activities related to these projects both at NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and aboard the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

==Portable Test System==
[[File:LOCAD-PTS.jpg|thumb|The LOCAD-PTS, currently aboard the ISS.]]
The '''Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development – Portable Test System''' ('''LOCAD-PTS''') is a handheld device for [[microbial]] monitoring aboard the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;LOCAD-PTS International Space Station (ISS) Page. {{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/LOCAD-PTS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033526/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/LOCAD-PTS.html |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved from the Endosafe-Portable Test System (Endosafe-PTS), developed by [[Charles River Laboratories]] for use in the pharmaceutical and health care industries.&lt;ref&gt;Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Endosafe-PTS. http://www.criver.com/en-US/ProdServ/ByType/Endotoxin/rapidtestingmethods/Pages/Endosafe-PTS.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004–2005, Charles River Laboratories teamed up with [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] and NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], including BAE Systems and Jacobs Technology, to modify the Endosafe-PTS device (and a sample handling system) for spaceflight. The LOCAD-PTS project has been funded in large part by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), under the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP), and specifically under the umbrella of Advanced Environmental Monitoring and Control (AEMC).&lt;ref&gt;NASA's Advanced Environmental Monitoring and Control (AEMC) Program. {{cite web |url=http://aemc.jpl.nasa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075637/http://aemc.jpl.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LOCAD-PTS Cartridge.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A LOCAD-PTS Cartridge.]]
The device itself (or reader) weighs 2.2 pounds and is a combined [[spectrophotometer]], heater and pump, operated with multiple interchangeable [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s for the detection of different microbial molecules. There are three different LOCAD-PTS cartridges aboard the ISS, for the detection of three different microbial molecules: [[endotoxin]], glucan and lipoteichoic acid. These three molecules are found mainly within [[gram-negative bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[gram-positive bacteria]], respectively. Endotoxin and glucan are detected with the ''Limulus'' amebocyte lysate (LAL) [[enzyme]] cascade, derived from the [[horseshoe crab]] ''Limulus polyphemus''. Lipoteichoic acid is detected with the Pro-Phenol Oxidase (PPO) enzyme cascade derived from the [[Jonah crab]], ''Cancer borealis''. By the amplification of a small signal, these enzyme cascades allow detection of very low amounts of starting microbial material. An astronaut can take a swab sample from a cabin surface, dissolve it in endotoxin-free water, and analyze it quantitatively with LOCAD-PTS in microgravity, all in under 15 minutes. Traditional culture-based methods aboard the ISS take several days and often require return of samples to Earth for more in-depth analysis by scientists on the ground.

[[File:Suni_Williams_aboard_the_ISS.jpg|thumb|Suni Williams analyzes a surface sample with LOCAD-PTS aboard the ISS (March 31, 2007)]]
LOCAD-PTS was launched to the ISS on December 9, 2006, aboard [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] [[STS-116]]. Following a four-month period of storage aboard the ISS, the device was first used by [[Expedition 14]]/[[Expedition 15|15]] Flight Engineer [[Suni Williams]] on March 31, 2007, to analyze surfaces within [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']].&lt;ref&gt;"No Foolin' -- 'Lab on a Chip' Works!" Science@NASA article (April 6, 2007). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/06apr_locad2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, LOCAD-PTS has been used extensively by the crews of [[Expedition 16]]–[[Expedition 18]] to monitor microbial material throughout the ISS. The LOCAD Team has supported each operation of LOCAD-PTS aboard the ISS from consoles at the NASA [[Payload Operations and Integration Center]] (POIC) at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.  LOCAD-PTS will continue to be used aboard ISS through October 2009 by Expedition 20 astronauts Mike Barratt and Tim Kopra.

The first phase of ISS operations took place between March 2007 to February 2008 (Expeditions 14–16), when LAL cartridges were used to detect endotoxin on surfaces within the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Ecol. 2004 Feb; 47(2): 119-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Endotoxin was detected at 50% of all surface sites and commonly found on surfaces within exercise, hygiene, sleeping and dining areas. Endotoxin was found at every surface site where [[Colony Forming Units]] (CFUs) were observed with culture-based contact slide methods. LAL-Glucan cartridges, for the detection of Beta-1,3-glucan, were launched to the ISS aboard Space Shuttle [[STS-123]] in March 2008. Preliminary results with these cartridges showed similar patterns to those observed for endotoxin, but glucan was found at higher levels and found to be far more widespread throughout the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;"Astronauts Swab the Deck." Science@NASA article (February 6, 2009). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/06feb_locad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Gram+ cartridges, for the detection of lipoteichoic acid) were launched to the ISS aboard [[STS-126]] on November 14, 2008. Tests with these cartridges have been performed during Expeditions 18 – 20.

'''LOCAD-PTS Exploration''' is an ISS experiment funded by the Moon and Mars Analogue Mission Activities (MMAMA) Program of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;LOCAD-PTS Exploration International Space Station (ISS) Page. {{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/LOCAD-PTS-Exploration.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407024415/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/LOCAD-PTS-Exploration.html |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collaboration between BAE Systems, Charles River Laboratories (CRL), NASA [[Johnson Space Center]] (Astronaut Office, Crew and Thermal Systems Division, and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) and Crew Survival Systems Branch), NASA [[Kennedy Space Center]] and NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. The goal of the experiment is to design and test procedures to monitor and document the spread of biological material associated with human spaceflight, both before and after launch, in preparation for the human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The LOCAD-PTS Exploration experiment has been funded by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), under the Moon and Mars Analogue Mission Activities (MMAMA) Program, and is the first SMD-funded experiment aboard the ISS.

The ISS Starboard [[Integrated Truss Structure#P6.2C S6 trusses|S6 Truss]]-section was analyzed with LOCAD-PTS in October 2008 and December 2008—while located in the [[Space Station Processing Facility]] (SSPF) at NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]]—and again in space following launch of Space Shuttle Discovery [[STS-119]].

The S6 Truss was swabbed in space on flight day 5, March 19, 2009, during the [[STS-119#EVA1|first spacewalk]] by [[Steve Swanson]] (EV1) and [[Richard R. Arnold]] (EV2). This 'swab' was performed indirectly with the spacesuit gloves. The gloves themselves were swabbed inside the ISS both before and after EVA, with LOCAD-PTS, by Expedition 18 Flight Engineer Sandy Magnus. Swab samples were then analyzed aboard the ISS by Magnus on flight day 7, March 21, 2009. This experiment marked the first time in human spaceflight that EVA crew checked themselves for microbes before EVA, and was mentioned by the STS-119 crew to President Obama during a video conference from space during STS-119.&lt;ref&gt;"ISS Spacewalkers Test Planetary Protection Concept." Science@NASA article (March 20, 2009). https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/20mar_locadexploration.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This type of procedure will be required to monitor and document the spread of biological material in support of NASA's goal to search for life on other planets&lt;ref&gt;The 2006 NASA Strategic Plan. NASA Document NP-2006-02-423-HQ.&lt;/ref&gt; and to comply with [[planetary protection]] regulations.

Further LOCAD-PTS Exploration tests were performed on the Flight 17A [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) "Leonardo" in the Payload Changeout Room on Pad 39A during August 5–8, 2009.  The 17A MPLM was also tested after insertion into the payload bay of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery]] [[STS-128]], scheduled for launch on August 25, 2009.  In addition to the MPLM itself, a microbial survey of the entire Rotating Service Structure (RSS) and Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) was also performed.  The external surfaces of the 17A MPLM will also be tested after landing of STS-128.  Each MPLM is a cargo carrier and brought back to Earth in the [[Space Shuttle Payload Bay]].

'''Lawler’s algorithm''' is a powerful technique for solving a variety of constrained scheduling problems.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nahmias. Production and Operations Analysis. 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-07-126370-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[algorithm]] handles any precedence constraints. It schedules a set of simultaneously arriving tasks on one processor with precedence constraints to minimize maximum tardiness or lateness. Precedence constraints occur when certain jobs must be completed before other jobs can be started.

==Objective Functions==
The [[objective function]] is assumed to be in the form &lt;math&gt;min \, max_{0\le i \le n} \, g_i(F_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is any [[nondecreasing function]] and &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the flow time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Y-T. Leung. Handbook of scheduling: algorithms, models, and performance analysis. 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-58488-397-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When &lt;math&gt;g_i (F_i) = F_i - d_i = L_i&lt;/math&gt;, the objective function corresponds to minimizing the maximum lateness, where &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is due time for job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; lateness of job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Another expression is &lt;math&gt;g_i (F_i) = max {(F_i-d_i,0)}&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to minimizing the maximum tardiness.

==Algorithm==

The algorithm works by planning the job with the least impact as late as possible. Starting at &lt;math&gt;t = \sum p_j&lt;/math&gt;.
 &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; set of already scheduled jobs (at start: S = &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;)
 &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; set of jobs which successors have been scheduled (at start: all jobs without successors)
 &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; time when the next job will be completed (at start: &lt;math&gt;t = \sum p_j&lt;/math&gt;)
 '''while'''&lt;math&gt;J \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;:
     select &lt;math&gt;j \in J&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_j(t) = min_{k \in J}f_k(t)&lt;/math&gt;
     schedule &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; such that it completes at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
     add &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, delete &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; and update &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
     &lt;math&gt;t = t - p_j&lt;/math&gt;
 '''end while'''

A '''leaflet''' (occasionally called '''foliole''') in [[botany]] is a leaf-like part of a [[compound leaf]].&lt;ref name="WaltersKeil1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Dirk R.|last2=Keil|first2=David J.|title=Vascular Plant Taxonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA33|edition=4th|year=1996|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|language=en|isbn=978-0-7872-2108-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it resembles an [[entire leaf]], a leaflet is not borne on a main [[plant stem]] or branch, as a leaf is, but rather on a [[leaf|petiole]] or a branch of the leaf. Compound leaves are common in many plant families and they differ widely in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. The two main classes of compound leaf morphology are [[Leaf shape|palmate]] and [[pinnate]].
For example, a ''[[Cannabis|hemp]]'' plant has palmate compound leaves, whereas some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' have pinnate leaves.

The ultimate free division (or leaflet) of a compound leaf, or a pinnate subdivision of a multipinnate leaf is called a '''[[pinnule]]''' or '''pinnula'''.

[[Image:LTP exemplar.jpg|thumb|300px|Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in [[synaptic strength]] following high-frequency stimulation of a [[chemical synapse]]. Studies of LTP are often carried out in slices of the [[hippocampus]], an important organ for learning and memory. In such studies, electrical recordings are made from cells and plotted in a graph such as this one. This graph compares the response to stimuli in synapses that have undergone LTP versus synapses that have not undergone LTP. Synapses that have undergone LTP tend to have stronger electrical responses to stimuli than other synapses. The term ''long-term potentiation'' comes from the fact that this increase in [[synaptic strength]], or ''potentiation'', lasts a very long time compared to other processes that affect synaptic strength.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-6003-8"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Paradiso, Michael A. |author2=Bear, Mark F. |author3=Connors, Barry W. |title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |page=718 |isbn=0-7817-6003-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[neuroscience]], '''long-term potentiation''' ('''LTP''') is a persistent strengthening of [[synapse]]s based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="cooke"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooke SF, Bliss TV |title=Plasticity in the human central nervous system |journal=Brain |volume=129 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1659–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16672292 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of LTP is [[long-term depression]], which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.

It is one of several phenomena underlying [[synaptic plasticity]], the ability of [[chemical synapse]]s to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of [[synaptic strength]],&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss TV, Collingridge GL |title=A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus |journal=Nature |volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=31–39 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8421494 |doi=10.1038/361031a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies [[learning]] and [[memory]].&lt;ref name="cooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bliss"/&gt;

LTP was discovered in the rabbit [[hippocampus]] by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of [[clinical research]], for example, in the areas of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[addiction medicine]].

==History==

===Early theories of learning===
[[File:Cajal-Restored.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 19th century neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] proposed that memories might be stored across [[synapse]]s, the junctions between neurons that allow for their communication.]]

At the end of the 19th century, scientists generally recognized that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams RW, Herrup K |title=The control of neuron number |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=11 |issue= 1|pages=423–53 |year=1988 |url=http://www.nervenet.org/papers/NUMBER_REV_1988.html |pmid=3284447 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.002231}}&lt;/ref&gt;) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production.&lt;ref name="cajal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramón y Cajal, Santiago | title = The Croonian Lecture: La Fine Structure des Centres Nerveux | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | volume = 55 | issue = 331-335 | pages = 444–468 | year = 1894 | doi = 10.1098/rspl.1894.0063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.

The [[Spain|Spanish]] neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] was among the first to suggest a mechanism of learning that did not require the formation of new neurons. In his 1894 [[Croonian Lecture]], he proposed that memories might instead be formed by strengthening the connections between existing neurons to improve the effectiveness of their communication.&lt;ref name="cajal"/&gt; [[Hebbian theory]], introduced by [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]] in 1949, echoed Ramón y Cajal's ideas, further proposing that cells may grow new connections or undergo metabolic changes that enhance their ability to communicate:

{{quote|Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or "trace") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability.... When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hebb, D. O. | title=Organization of Behavior: a Neuropsychological Theory  | location=New York | publisher=John Wiley | year=1949 | isbn=0-471-36727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though these theories of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not equipped with the [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, at about the same time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.

===Discovery===
[[Image:Hippocampus.png|thumb|right|200px|LTP was first discovered in the rabbit [[hippocampus]]. In humans, the hippocampus is located in the medial [[temporal lobe]]. This illustration of the underside of the [[human brain]] shows the hippocampus highlighted in red. The [[frontal lobe]] is at the top of the illustration and the [[occipital lobe]] is at the bottom.]]

LTP was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 in the [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], laboratory of [[Per Andersen]].&lt;ref name="lomo"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Terje Lømo | title=The discovery of long-term potentiation | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume=358 | issue=1432 | year=2003 | pages=617–20 |pmid=12740104 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1226 | pmc=1693150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=68 |issue=Suppl 277 |pages=128 |last=Lømo |first=Terje |title=Frequency potentiation of excitatory synaptic activity in the dentate area of the hippocampal formation |journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Lømo conducted a series of [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] experiments on [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] rabbits to explore the role of the hippocampus in [[short-term memory]].

Lømo's experiments focused on connections, or synapses, from the [[perforant pathway]] to the [[dentate gyrus]]. These experiments were carried out by stimulating presynaptic fibers of the perforant pathway and recording responses from a collection of postsynaptic cells of the dentate gyrus. As expected, a single pulse of electrical stimulation to fibers of the perforant pathway caused [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s (EPSPs) in cells of the dentate gyrus. What Lømo unexpectedly observed was that the postsynaptic cells' response to these single-pulse stimuli could be enhanced for a long period of time if he first delivered a [[tetanic stimulation|high-frequency train of stimuli]] to the presynaptic fibers. When such a train of stimuli was applied, subsequent single-pulse stimuli elicited stronger, prolonged EPSPs in the postsynaptic cell population. This phenomenon, whereby a high-frequency stimulus could produce a long-lived enhancement in the postsynaptic cells' response to subsequent single-pulse stimuli, was initially called "long-lasting potentiation".&lt;ref name="bliss_lomo"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Lømo T |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the anaesthetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J Physiol |volume=232 |issue=2 |pages=331–56 |year=1973 |pmid=4727084 |pmc=1350458 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1973.sp010273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bliss_g-m"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Gardner-Medwin A |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the unanaestetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J.

The physical and biological mechanism of LTP is still not understood, but some successful models have been developed.[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_synaptic_plasticity] Studies of [[Dendritic spines#Modeling|dendritic spines]], protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract over the course of minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the [[electrical resistance]] of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as [[BCM Theory]], which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to [[NMDA receptor]] [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage gates]], have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional ''a priori'' [[Hebbian learning]] model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Types==
Since its original discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP has been observed in a variety of other neural structures, including the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]], [[amygdala]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clugnet |first=MC |author2=LeDoux JE  |title=Synaptic plasticity in fear conditioning circuits: induction of LTP in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala by stimulation of the medial geniculate body. |journal=J Neurosci |volume=10 |pages=2818–24 |pmid=2388089 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/10/8/2818 |format=PDF |issue=8 |date=1 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.&lt;ref name="riches"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malenka R, Bear M |title=LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=5–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15450156 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different areas of the brain exhibit different forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus.&lt;ref name="developmental-switch"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasuda H, Barth A, Stellwagen D, Malenka R |title=A developmental switch in the signaling cascades for LTP induction |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=15–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12469130 |doi=10.1038/nn985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the [[NMDA receptor]], others may depend upon the [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]] (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the [[Schaffer collateral]] pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the [[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|mossy fiber]] pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris E, Cotman C |title=Long-term potentiation of guinea pig mossy fiber responses is not blocked by N-methyl D-aspartate antagonists |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=132–7 |year=1986 |pmid=3022192 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(86)90451-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre- and postsynaptic activity required to induce LTP are other criteria by which LTP is classified. Broadly, this allows classification of LTP into Hebbian, non-Hebbian, and anti-Hebbian mechanisms. Borrowing its name from [[Hebb's postulate]], summarized by the maxim that "cells that fire together wire together," '''Hebbian LTP''' requires simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic depolarization for its induction.&lt;ref name="pmid2883309"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wigström H, Gustafsson B |title=Postsynaptic control of hippocampal long-term potentiation |journal=J.

Owing to its predictable organization and readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus has become the prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP,&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; and is therefore the focus of this article.

==Properties==
NMDA receptor-dependent LTP exhibits several properties, including input specificity, associativity, cooperativity, and persistence.

; Input specificity
: Once induced, LTP at one synapse does not spread to other synapses; rather LTP is ''input specific''. Long-term potentiation is only propagated to those synapses according to the rules of associativity and cooperativity. However, the input specificity of LTP may be incomplete at short distances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  One model to explain the input specificity of LTP was presented by Frey and Morris in 1997 and is called the [[synaptic tagging|synaptic tagging and capture]] hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

; Associativity
: ''Associativity'' refers to the observation that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

; Cooperativity
: LTP can be induced either by strong [[tetanic stimulation]] of a single pathway to a synapse, or ''cooperatively'' via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.&lt;ref name="pmid12740107"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNaughton BL |title=Long-term potentiation, cooperativity and Hebb's cell assemblies: a personal history |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

; Persistence
: LTP is ''persistent'', lasting from several minutes to many months, and it is this persistence that separates LTP from other forms of [[synaptic plasticity]].&lt;ref name="abraham"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abraham WC |title=How long will long-term potentiation last? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=735–44 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12740120 |pmc=1693170 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1222 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12740120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early phase===
[[Image:Early LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early phase of LTP, one model of which is shown here, is independent of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynch M |title=Long-term potentiation and memory |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=87–136 |year=2004 |pmid=14715912 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/84/1/87 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00014.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:CaMKII-dodecameric.png|thumb|200px|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) appears to be an important mediator of the early, protein synthesis-independent phase of LTP.]]

====Maintenance====
While induction entails the ''transient'' activation of [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|CaMKII]] and [[protein kinase C|PKC]], maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) is characterized by their ''persistent'' activation. During this stage, PKMz ([[Protein kinase Mζ]]) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, they are able to carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt;

====Expression====
[[Phosphorylation]] is a chemical reaction in which a small [[phosphate]] group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation to carry out the two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing [[AMPA receptor]]s to increase their activity.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malinow R |title=AMPA receptor trafficking and long-term potentiation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=707–14 |year=2003 |pmid=12740116 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1233 |pmc=1693162}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.

While the above model of E-LTP describes entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically.&lt;ref name="emptage"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emptage N, Reid C, Fine A, Bliss T |title=Optical quantal analysis reveals a presynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal Schaffer-associational synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=797–804 |year=2003 |pmid=12797963 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WSS-4C5XN9K-G&amp;_coverDate=06%2F05%2F2003&amp;_alid=523934887&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=7054&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15f6a55d9b53d2265077f3a74a8a495a |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00325-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII activity in the postsynaptic cell during E-LTP may lead to the synthesis of a "retrograde messenger", discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in [[Early long-term potentiation|early LTP]], the retrograde messenger may also play a role in the expression of late LTP.

===Late phase===
[[Image:Late LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early and late phases of LTP are thought to communicate via the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK).&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;]]

Late LTP (L-LTP) is the natural extension of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires [[gene transcription]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Frey S, Schollmeier F, Krug M |title=Influence of actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor, on long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro |journal=J Physiol |volume=(Pt 3) |issue= Pt 3 |series=490|pages=703–11 |date=1 January 1996|pmid=8683469 |pmc=1158708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Krug M, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=Anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocks late phases of LTP phenomena in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro |journal=Brain Res |volume=452 |issue=1-2 |pages=57–65 |year=1988 |pmid=3401749 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(88)90008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.

====Induction====
Late LTP is induced by changes in [[gene expression]] and [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] brought about by the persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; In fact, MAPK—specifically the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kovács KA, Steullet P, Steinmann M, Do KQ, Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR |title=TORC1 is a calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detector involved in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity. |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue= 11 |pages= 4700–5 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17360587 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0607524104  | pmc=1838663}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.

====Maintenance====
Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include [[transcription factor]]s such as CREB.&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt; ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be [[protein kinase Mζ]] (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction.&lt;ref name="PKMz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Serrano P, Yao Y, Sacktor T |title=Persistent phosphorylation by protein kinase Mzeta maintains late-phase long-term potentiation |journal=J Neurosci |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1979–84 |year=2005  |pmid=15728837 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5132-04.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pastalkova E, Serrano P, Pinkhasova D, Wallace E, Fenton A, Sacktor T |title=Storage of spatial information by the maintenance mechanism of LTP |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1141–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16931766 |doi=10.1126/science.1128657}}&lt;/ref&gt; PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active not just in the first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of [[long-term memory]]. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in [[retrograde amnesia]] with intact [[short-term memory]]; PKMζ does not play a role in the establishment of short-term memory.&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/&gt; PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/&gt; by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volk|first=Lenora J.|author2=Bachman, Julia L. |author3=Johnson, Richard |author4=Yu, Yilin |author5= Huganir, Richard L. |title=PKM-ζ is not required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning and memory|journal=Nature|date=2 January 2013|volume=493|issue=7432|pages=420–423|doi=10.1038/nature11802|pmid=23283174|pmc=3830948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as [[Bouton (synapse)|axonal bouton]], [[dendritic spine]] and [[postsynaptic density]].&lt;ref name="stabilization_plasticity"&gt;
{{cite journal

On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins [[PSD-95]] and [[HOMER1|Homer1c]] has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.&lt;ref name="stabilization_plasticity" /&gt;

====Expression====
The identities of only a few proteins synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in [[dendritic spine]] number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of [[synaptotagmin]] and an increase in [[synaptic vesicle]] number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.

Even in studies restricted to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined the location of the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic [[cell body]] or in its [[dendrite]]s.&lt;ref name="translation"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelleher R, Govindarajan A, Tonegawa S |title=Translational regulatory mechanisms in persistent forms of synaptic plasticity |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=59–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15450160 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having observed [[ribosome]]s (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kang H, Schuman E |title=A requirement for local protein synthesis in neurotrophin-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5280 |pages=1402–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8703078 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5280.1402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steward O, Worley P |title=A cellular mechanism for targeting newly synthesized mRNAs to synaptic sites on dendrites |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=98 |issue=13 |pages=7062–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11416188 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/13/7062 |doi=10.1073/pnas.131146398 |pmc=34623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the popularity of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.

===Retrograde signaling===
{{main article|Retrograde signaling in LTP}}

Retrograde signaling is a hypothesis that attempts to explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence suggests that it is expressed presynaptically as well.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emptage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlidis P, Montgomery J, Madison D |title=Presynaptic protein kinase activity supports long-term potentiation at synapses between individual hippocampal neurons |journal=J Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=4497–505 |year=2000 |pmid=10844019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis gets its name because normal [[synaptic transmission]] is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a ''retrograde'' (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of [[neurotransmitter vesicle]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zakharenko S, Patterson S, Dragatsis I, Zeitlin S, Siegelbaum S, Kandel E, Morozov A |title=Presynaptic BDNF required for a presynaptic but not postsynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=975–90 |year=2003 |pmid=12971897 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00543-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrograde signaling is currently a contentious subject as some investigators do not believe the presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on [[nitric oxide]], while most recent evidence points to [[cell adhesion]] proteins.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;

===Synaptic tagging===
Before the local protein synthesis hypothesis gained significant support, there was general agreement that the protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.

The synaptic tagging hypothesis proposes that a "synaptic tag" is synthesized at synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli, and that this synaptic tag may serve to capture plasticity-related proteins shipped cell-wide from the cell body.&lt;ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Morris R |title=Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6616 |pages=533–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9020359 |doi=10.1038/385533a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of LTP in the [[Nudibranch|marine snail]] ''[[Aplysia californica]]'' have implicated synaptic tagging as a mechanism for the input-specificity of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin K, Casadio A, Zhu H, Yaping E, Rose J, Chen M, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=Synapse-specific, long-term facilitation of aplysia sensory to motor synapses: a function for local protein synthesis in memory storage |journal=Cell |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=927–38 |year=1997 |pmid=9428516 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80484-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casadio A, Martin K, Giustetto M, Zhu H, Chen M, Bartsch D, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=A transient, neuron-wide form of CREB-mediated long-term facilitation can be stabilized at specific synapses by local protein synthesis |journal=Cell |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=221–37 |year=1999 |pmid=10535740 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81653-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that given two widely separated synapses, an LTP-inducing stimulus at one synapse drives several signaling cascades (described previously) that initiates gene expression in the cell nucleus. At the same synapse (but not the unstimulated synapse), local protein synthesis creates a short-lived (less than three hours) synaptic tag.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging" /&gt;--&gt; The products of gene expression are shipped globally throughout the cell, but are only captured by synapses that express the synaptic tag. Thus only the synapse receiving LTP-inducing stimuli is potentiated, demonstrating LTP's input specificity.

The synaptic tag hypothesis may also account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (''see [[#Properties|Properties]]'') is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas one might expect only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), ''both'' synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.

Cooperativity is observed when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging does not explain how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.

As described previously, the molecules that underlie LTP can be classified as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;

In addition to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered by a variety of modulators. For example, the [[steroid hormone]] [[estradiol]] may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent [[dendritic spine]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Segal M, Murphy D |title=CREB activation mediates plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons |journal=Neural Plast |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=9920677 |doi=10.1155/NP.1998.1 |pmc=2565317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[β-adrenergic receptor]] agonists such as [[norepinephrine]] may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Straube T, Frey J |title=Involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in protein synthesis-dependent late long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats: the critical role of the LTP induction strength |journal=Neuroscience |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=473–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12770561 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitric oxide synthase]] activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu Y, Kandel E, Hawkins R |title=Nitric oxide signaling contributes to late-phase LTP and CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus |journal=J Neurosci |volume=19 |issue=23 |pages=10250–61 |year=1999 |pmid=10575022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, activation of [[dopamine receptor]]s may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Matthies H, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=The effect of dopaminergic D1 receptor blockade during tetanization on the expression of long-term potentiation in the rat CA1 region in vitro |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=129 |issue=1 |pages=111–4 |year=1991 |pmid=1833673 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(91)90732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Otmakhova N, Lisman J |title=D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses |journal=J Neurosci |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=7478–86 |year=1996 |pmid=8922403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to behavioral memory==
While the long-term potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems to provide an elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning at the level of the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from ''in vitro'' studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in [[Fear processing in the brain|fear processing]].

===Spatial memory===
[[Image:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Morris water maze]] task has been used to demonstrate the necessity of NMDA receptors in establishing [[spatial memory|spatial memories]].]]

In 1986, Richard Morris provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris R, Anderson E, Lynch G, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411 |doi=10.1038/319774a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested the [[spatial memory]] of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the [[Morris water maze]], a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker [[APV (NMDAR antagonist)|APV]], while the other group served as the [[control group|control]]. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.

Similarly, [[Susumu Tonegawa]] demonstrated in 1996 that the CA1 area of the hippocampus is crucial to the formation of spatial memories in living mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McHugh T, Blum K, Tsien J, Tonegawa S, Wilson M |title=Impaired hippocampal representation of space in CA1-specific NMDAR1 knockout mice |journal=Cell |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=1339–49 |year=1996 |pmid=8980239 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81828-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called ''[[place cell]]s'' located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a ''place field'' — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.

===Inhibitory avoidance===
In 2006, [[Jonathan Whitlock]] and colleagues reported on a series of experiments that provided perhaps the strongest evidence of LTP's role in behavioral memory, arguing that to conclude that LTP underlies behavioral learning, the two processes must both mimic and occlude one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitlock J, Heynen A, Shuler M, Bear M |title=Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1093–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16931756 |doi=10.1126/science.1128134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employing an inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, researchers trained rats in a two-chambered apparatus with light and dark chambers, the latter being fitted with a device that delivered a foot shock to the rat upon entry. An analysis of CA1 hippocampal synapses revealed that inhibitory avoidance training induced ''in vivo'' AMPA receptor phosphorylation of the same type as that seen in LTP ''in vitro''; that is, inhibitory avoidance training mimicked LTP. In addition, synapses potentiated during training could not be further potentiated by experimental manipulations that would have otherwise induced LTP; that is, inhibitory avoidance training occluded LTP. In a response to the article, Timothy Bliss and colleagues remarked that these and related experiments "substantially advance the case for LTP as a neural mechanism for memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Collingridge G, Laroche S |title=Neuroscience. ZAP and ZIP, a story to forget |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1058–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16931746 |doi=10.1126/science.1132538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
The role of LTP in disease is less clear than its role in basic mechanisms of [[synaptic plasticity]]. However, alterations in LTP may contribute to a number of [[neurological disease]]s, including [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[epilepsy]], and [[neuropathic pain]].&lt;ref name="cooke-clinical"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooke SF, Bliss TV |title=Plasticity in the human central nervous system |journal=Brain |volume=129 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1659–73 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16672292 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl082 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16672292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired LTP may also have a role in [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[drug addiction]].

===Alzheimer's disease===
[[Image:APP and LTP in Alzheimer disease.png|thumb|150px|Misprocessing of [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP) in [[Alzheimer's disease]] disrupts LTP and is thought to lead to early cognitive decline in individuals with the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid12740129"/&gt;]]

LTP has received much attention among those who study [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), a [[neurodegenerative disease]] that causes marked cognitive decline and [[dementia]]. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other [[medial temporal lobe]] structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, some have suggested that the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.

In a 2003 review of the literature, Rowan ''et al.'' proposed one model for how LTP might be affected in AD.&lt;ref name="pmid12740129"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowan MJ, Klyubin I, Cullen WK, Anwyl R |title=Synaptic plasticity in animal models of early Alzheimer's disease |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=821–8 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12740129 |pmc=1693153 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1240 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=358&amp;issue=1432&amp;spage=821}}&lt;/ref&gt; AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called [[amyloid β]] (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and may lead to the cognitive decline seen early in AD.

AD may also impair LTP through mechanisms distinct from Aβ. For example, one study demonstrated that the enzyme PKMζ accumulates in [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s, which are a pathologic marker of AD. PKMζ is an enzyme with critical importance in the [[#Maintenance 2|maintenance of late LTP]].&lt;ref name="pmid16691113"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crary JF, Shao CY, Mirra SS, Hernandez AI, Sacktor TC |title=Atypical protein kinase C in neurodegenerative disease I: PKMzeta aggregates with limbic neurofibrillary tangles and AMPA receptors in Alzheimer disease |journal=Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=319–26 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16691113 |doi=10.1097/01.jnen.0000218442.07664.04 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00005072-200604000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug addiction===
Research in the field of [[addiction medicine]] has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that [[drug addiction]] represents a powerful form of learning and memory.&lt;ref name="pmid17948030"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kauer JA, Malenka RC |title=Synaptic plasticity and addiction |journal=Nature Reviews.

Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP&lt;ref name="pmid17948030"/&gt; and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.&lt;ref name="pmid14993438"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf ME |title=LTP may trigger addiction |journal=Molecular interventions |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=248–52 |date=August 2003 |pmid=14993438 |doi=10.1124/mi.3.5.248 |url=http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14993438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20964">'''Material flow analysis''' ('''MFA''') (also referred to as '''substance flow analysis''' ('''SFA''')) is an analytical method to quantify flows and stocks of materials or substances in a well-defined [[system]]. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of [[industrial ecology]] or [[anthropogenic metabolism|anthropogenic]], [[urban metabolism|urban]], [[social metabolism|social]] and [[industrial metabolism]]. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within [[ecosystem]]s. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking [[nutrient]] flows through a [[waste water treatment plant]]. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called [[material flow cost accounting]]. MFA is an important tool to study the [[circular economy]] and to devise [[material flow management]]. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the ''[[Journal of Industrial Ecology]]'', ''[[Ecological Economics]]'', ''[[Environmental Science and Technology]]'', and ''Resources, Conservation, and Recycling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/resources-conservation-and-recycling/|title=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Motivation===
[[Human need]]s such as shelter, food, transport, or communication require materials like wood, starch, sugar, iron and steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity [[Economic growth|expands]], material production, use, and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be [[externality|neglected]] anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from [[landfill]]s or [[oil spill]]s. Rising concern about [[global warming]] puts a previously unimportant waste flow, [[carbon dioxide]], on top of the political and scientific agenda. 
The gradual shift from primary material production to [[recycling|urban mining]] in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.
Scientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the [[anthroposphere]]. Material flow analysis is such a method.

===Basic principles===
MFA is based on two fundamental and well-established scientific principles, the [[system]]s approach and [[mass balance]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part I, 1860-1970, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(1), 1998, pp 61-78, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.1.61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part II, 1970-1998, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(4), 1998, pp 107-136, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.4.107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The system definition is the starting point of every MFA study.

====System definition====
[[File:MFASystem 1.png|thumb|Basic MFA system without quantification.]]
[[File:MFASystem 2.png|thumb|A more general MFA system without quantification.]]
An MFA system is a model of an industrial plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more [[unit process|processes]], material flows between processes, and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.

Next to specifying the arrangement of processes, stocks, and flows in the system definition, the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.
The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. 
The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. 
The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain [[chemical element]] such as cadmium or a substance such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as [[energy]].

MFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms 'material', 'substance', or 'good', as laid out, for example, in chapter 2.1 of Brunner and Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brunner | first = P.H. | last2 = Rechberger | first2 = H. | title = Practical Handbook of Material Flow Analysis | publisher = Lewis Publishers, New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56670-604-1 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main references for the MFA method.

* A [[chemical element]] is "a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom distinguished by its atomic number".&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC, Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book") (1997). Online corrected version:  (2006–) "chemical element".&lt;/ref&gt;
* A substance is "any (chemical) element or compound composed of uniform units. All substances are characterised by a unique and identical constitution and are thus homogeneous." From chapter 2.1.1 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* A good is defined as "economic entity of matter with a positive or negative economic value. Goods are made up of one or several substances". From chapter 2.1.2 in Brunner and Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* The term material in MFA "serves as an umbrella term for both substances and goods". From chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
[[File:MFASystem 3.png|thumb|A typical MFA system with quantification.]]

====Process balance====

One of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the [[social metabolism|metabolism]] of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting, MFA also covers non-economic waste flows, emissions to the environment, and non-market natural resources.

The process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process '[[oil refinery]]', for example, one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element, while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel, but a steel mill does not.

When quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data, mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using [[data validation and reconciliation]], and the STAN-software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stan2web.net/|title=Home|website=www.stan2web.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of MFA applications on different spatial and temporal scales==

MFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements, substances, and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples:

* ''MFA on a national or regional scale'' (also referred to as [[material flow accounting]]): In this type of study, the material exchanges between an economy and the natural environment are analyzed. Several indicators are calculated in order to assess the level of [[resource intensity]] of the system. &lt;ref name="ES2013"&gt;{{Cite report | last = Eurostat | title =  Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA) | publisher = Eurostat | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KR2015"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krausmann | first = Fridolin | last2 = Weisz | first2 = Helga | last3 = Eisenmenger| first3 = Nina | last4 = Schütz | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Haas | first5 = Willi | last6 = Schaffartzik | first6 = Anke | title = Economy-wide Material Flow Accounting - Introduction and Guide. Social Ecology Working paper 151 | publisher = Institute of Social Ecology, Alpen-Adria University, Klagenfurt/Graz/Vienna | year = 2015 | issn = 1726-3808 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Corporate material flow analysis'', or MFA along an ''industrial supply chain'' involves a number of companies: The goal of material flow analysis within a company is to quantify and then optimize the production processes so that materials and energy are used more efficiently manner, e.g., by [[recycling]] and [[waste]] reduction. Companies can use the results obtained by [[Material Flow Cost Accounting]] to reduce their operational costs and improve environmental performance.
* In the ''life cycle of a product'': The life cycle inventory, whose compilation is at the core of [[life cycle assessment]], follows the MFA methodology as it is based on an explicit system definition and process balances.

== Historical development ==

* Mass balance or the conservation of matter has been postulated already in ancient Greece, and it was introduced into modern chemistry by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (cf. chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;), from where it found its way to chemical engineering and finally to environmental science.
* Other seminal contributions were made by [[Sanctorius]] and [[Theodor Weyl]].
* Dennis Meadows made a wide audience aware of the physical foundation of the economy when he co-authored the bestseller ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' in 1971. Meadows et al. based their predictions on an analysis of resource stocks; see in the [[Glossary of environmental science#R|glossary of environmental science]].
* The methodology of MFA was developed during the 1980s and 1990s. Development happened simultaneously in different research groups. Central publications on the MFA methodology include Baccini and Bader (1996),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini and Bader 1996, 'Regionaler Stoffhaushalt' (Regional metabolism), Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg (Germany), {{ISBN|3-86025-235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunner and Rechberger (2004),&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; Baccini and Brunner (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini P. &amp; Brunner P.H. (2012). Metabolism of the Anthroposphere, Analysis, Evaluation, Design. 2nd Edition, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. {{ISBN|9780262016650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van der Voet et al. (2002).&lt;ref&gt;'Predicting future emissions based on characteristics of stocks', Ecological Economics, 2002, 41(2), 223-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, who worked at the Wuppertal Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wupperinst.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Wuppertal Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the MFA-related concept of Material Input Per Service unit (MIPS).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Bleek {{citation |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-5650-8_4 |date=1994 |title= MIPS: Ein neues ökologisches Maß}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[UNEP]] Resource Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=UNEP}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2007 by the United Nations Environment Program. In analogy to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; it brings together experts from many disciplines and institutions to review the current state of research on societal metabolism and to communicate the latest findings to policymakers and stakeholders.

===Recent development===
* MFA concepts have been or are being incorporated in national accounts in several countries and regions such as the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Material_flow_accounts |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927070822/http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MFA is also used in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].
* Several international conferences or other meetings provide a platform for researchers and policymakers to meet and exchange results and ideas, including the [[World Resources Forum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldresourcesforum.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=World Resources Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-annual international conference on material flow analysis and sustainable development.
* MFA-IO is an approach to establish an MFA system of the whole economy using monetary and physical Input-Output tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nakamura | first = S. | last2 = Kondo | first2 = Y. | title = Waste Input-Output Analysis. Concepts and Application to Industrial Ecology | publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4020-9901-4 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Sustainable Europe Research Institute (SERI) in Vienna, Austria, has developed a database called materialflows.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.materialflows.net/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=materialflows.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic MFA aims for long-term quantification of MFA systems and uses historic development patterns of physical stocks and flows to create robust scenarios for the years and decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Müller, Stock dynamics for forecasting material flows--Case study for housing in The Netherlands, Ecological Economics 59(1), 2006, pp 142-156, {{doi|10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.025}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Japan has developed into a hotspot for MFA research. The country has scarce mineral resources and therefore depends on imports of energy carriers, ores, and other raw materials. The Japanese government fosters research on material cycles and also inaugurated the 3-R concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/3r/en/index.html |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=3R in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting a state-of-the-art MFA==
A state-of-the-art MFA consists of the following steps:&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* Establish an explicit system definition: Specify the system boundary with geographical and temporal scope, processes (can contain stocks), and flows. Specify the material for which the system is to be quantified (product, substance, or indicator element). Make sure that each stock is associated with a process and that each flow connects one process to another. Flows can also begin or end outside the system boundary.
* Define and name the system variables. The system variables include: All stocks within the processes, all flows between processes, and all flows coming from outside or going to outside the system boundaries. Sometimes, stocks are not considered and only the net stock changes are of interest. For each variable, it must be clear whether it is a stock or a flow, and this distinction needs to be reflected in the names and in the mathematical symbols chosen.
* Quantify the system variables by linking them to literature, measurement, or modelled data.
* Performe a mass balance check for all processes and the system as a whole.
* Optional: Visualise your system by using the box-and-arrow scheme shown above or by using [[Sankey diagram|Sankey diagrams]].
* Document the MFA by reporting the explicit system definition along with the list of quantified system variables and the mass balance checks.

===The difference between material and substance flow analysis===
While the term 'substance' in 'substance flow analysis (SFA) always refers to chemical substances, the term 'material' in 'material flow analysis (MFA)' has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; the term 'material' comprises substances AND goods, and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel, timber, or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase.

==Relation to other methods==

MFA is complementary to the other core [[industrial ecology]] methods [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) and [[input-output model|input-output (I/O) models]]. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose, scope, and data requirements.

MFA studies often cover the entire cycle (mining, production, manufacturing, use, waste handling) of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA, which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series (dynamic modelling) and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long-term trends in material use.

* Compared to I/O analyses, the number of processes considered in MFA systems is usually much lower. On the other hand, mass balance ensures that flows of by-products or waste are not overlooked in MFA studies, whereas in I/O tables these flows are often not included due to their lack of economic value. Physical I/O models are much less common than economic tables. Material stocks are not covered by IO analysis, only the addition to stock can be included in form of capital accumulation.
* Life cycle inventories record the demand for many different materials associated with individual products, whereas MFA studies typically focus on a single material used in many different products.

== The Mesopredator Release Effect==
When populations of [[apex predator]]s decrease, populations of mesopredators often increase. This is the [[mesopredator release effect]]. "Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When apex predators are removed from the ecosystem, this gives the mesopredator have less competition and conflict. They are able to catch more prey and have fewer causes of death. Often times mesopredators can take over the role as apex predators. This happens when new species are introduced into an ecosystem or when species leave or are killed off of an ecosystem. When this happens, and the new apex predator or former mesopredator, becomes the new species on top of the food chain, it is important to remember that they are not ecologically identical to the former apex predator, and is likely a smaller species having different effects on the structure and stability of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mesopredators that become the new apex predators are the species that benefit from this mesopredator release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apex predators reduce mesopredator populations, and change mesopredator behaviors and habitat choices, by preying on and intimidating mesopredators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Euan G.|last2=Johnson|first2=Christopher N.|date=2009-09-01|title=Predator interactions, mesopredator release and biodiversity conservation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=9|pages=982–998|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in any ecosystem with any type of relationship between predator and prey. However, in the case of the relationship between apex predator and mesopredator, it could mean that the apex predator causes the mesopredator to leave the ecosystem, again, creating room for a new species to become mesopredator. 

Mesopredator outbreaks are increasing over the last little while in fragmented habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by a few reasons. A main cause is by the disappearance of apex species within the habitat. Apex species are usually larger animals who require a bigger area and will often leave if the habitat is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the apex predator leaves the ecosystem, the former mesopredator will become the new apex predator, and a new species becomes the mesopredator. Another cause created also created by the apex predators being larger animals is that they will often have more encounters with humans, leaving them more susceptible to harmful conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These harmful conflicts can either cause the apex predator to leave the ecosystem in fear of danger, or if the situation is extreme enough, the humans will have killed off the apex predator from their habitat. Again, this is another example showing how the role of mesopredator and apex predator is constantly changing. Another reason why mesopredator outbreaks are becoming more popular is because of certain resources being added in fragmented areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources such as pet food, trash, crop, and crop pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources often appear when development is occurring on land near the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario is the most ideal for mesopredator outbreaks to occur.

[[File:A Mind Map on ICT and Pedagogy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A mind map about educational technology]]
{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first is what is otherwise called '[[Elements of music|rudiments]]', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains "musica instrumentalis" as beneath the "true" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' ("It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows").&lt;/ref&gt; However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, chapters 4–7 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15–17}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] or [[Ph.D]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Prehistoric music}}

Preserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|Gǔdí]], and [[Anasazi flute]].

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia====
{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|Kümmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, "All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years."{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43–44}}

====China====
{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}

Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"&gt;Joseph S.C. Lam, "China.", §II, "History and Theory", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 15, 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&amp;nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bagley, "The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 239&amp;nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the "Yellow Bell." He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''lülü'' or later the ''shierlü''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

The ''lülü'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40–41}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''lülü'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41–42}}

The two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&amp;nbsp;BCE) as pitches of "superior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of "inferior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' ("Record of music", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376&amp;nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' ("Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants")."&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"/&gt;

====India====
The [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 – 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 200&amp;nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''Śrutis''), scales (''Grāmas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''Mūrchanās'', modes?), melodic types (''Jātis''), instruments, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nāțyaśāstra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol. II, Calcutta, The Asiatic Society, 1961. See particularly pp. 5–19 of the Introduction, ''The Ancient Indian Theory and Practice of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{see also|Musical system of ancient Greece|List of music theorists#Antiquity}}

Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, "Greek Music Theory", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* technical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions
* treatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.
Several names of theorists are known before these works, including [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – c. 495&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Philolaus]] (c. 470 – c. 385&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Archytas]] (428–347&amp;nbsp;BCE), and others.

Works of the first type (technical manuals) include
* Anonymous (erroneously attributed to [[Euclid]]) ''Division of the Canon'', Κατατομή κανόνος, 4th–3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Andrew Barker, ''Greek Musical Writings'', vol. 2: ''Harmonic and Acoustic Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 191–208.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theon of Smyrna]], ''On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato'', Τωv κατά τό μαθηματικόν χρησίμων είς τήν Πλάτωνος άνάγνωσις, 115–140&amp;nbsp;CE.
* [[Nicomachus#Manual of Harmonics|Nicomachus of Gerasa]], ''Manual of Harmonics'', Άρμονικόν έγχειρίδιον, 100–150&amp;nbsp;CE
* [[Cleonides]], ''Introduction to Harmonics'', Είσαγωγή άρμονική, 2nd century CE.
* Gaudentius, ''Harmonic Introduction'', Άρμονική είσαγωγή, 3d or 4th century CE.
* Bacchius Geron, ''Introduction to the Art of Music'', Είσαγωγή τέχνης μουσικής, 4th century CE or later.
* [[Alypius of Alexandria|Alypius]], ''Introduction to Music'', Είσαγωγή μουσική, 4th–5th century CE.

More philosophical treatises of the second type include
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Harmonic Elements'', Άρμονικά στοιχεία, 375/360 – after 320&amp;nbsp;BCE.
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Rhythmic Elements'', Ρυθμικά στοιχεία.
* Claudius [[Ptolemy]], ''Harmonics'', Άρμονικά, 127–148&amp;nbsp;CE.
* [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrius]], ''On Ptolemy's Harmonics'', Είς τά άρμονικά Πτολεμαίον ύπόμνημα, 232/3-c. 305&amp;nbsp;CE.

===Middle Ages===
{{see also|List of music theorists#Middle Ages}}

====China====
Some imported early Chinese instruments became important components of the entertainment music of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) courts: the bent-neck [[pipa]] (quxiang pipa), the [[Guan (instrument)|bili]], the [[konghou]] and the [[jiegu]].

====Europe====
The Latin treatise ''De institutione musica'' by the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: "Boethius could provide a model only for that part of theory which underlies but does not give rules for composition or performance. The first surviving strictly musical treatise of Carolingian times is directed towards musical practice, the Musica disciplina of Aurelian of Réôme (9th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ninth century, [[Hucbald]] worked towards more precise pitch notation for the [[neume]]s used to record plainchant.

[[Guido d'Arezzo]]' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled ''Epistola de ignoto cantu'',&lt;ref&gt;For a modern edition of the letter, see [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/gui_epi.html].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony "come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|loc=passim}}{{sfn|Ekwueme|1974|loc=passim}}

[[Sacred Harp]] music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege "fa, sol, la" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving "shape notes", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for "singing by note" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=0-8203-0426-3|location=United States of America|pages=4–5, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals of music==
{{Main article|Aspect of music}}
Music is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; "music theory" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}

===Pitch===
{{Main article|Pitch (music)}}
[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&amp;nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single "class" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}

[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===
{{Main article|Musical scale| Musical mode}}
[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]
Notes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
{{Main article|Consonance and dissonance}}
{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.
Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]’s concept of "emancipated" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as "higher," more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.--&gt;}}

===Rhythm===
{{Main article|Rhythm}}
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. [[Syncopation|Syncopated]] rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syncopation|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e10023|website=Oxford Dictionary of Music|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="Syncopation is achieved by accenting a weak instead of a strong beat, by putting rests on strong beats, by holding on over strong beats, and by introducing a sudden change of time‐signature."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called [[polyrhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyrhythm|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22059|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="The superposition of different rhythms or metres."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are [[Maury Yeston]],{{sfn|Yeston|1976}} [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]],{{sfn|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1985}} [[Jonathan Kramer]],{{sfn|Kramer|1988}}  and [[Justin London]].{{sfn|London|2004}}

A [[melody]] is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3–47}}

A chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|Károlyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern Western, West African,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008}} and Oceanian{{sfn|Linkels|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Specific page citation within this twelve-page article needed.--&gt;}} music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}}

The most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triads]], so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give [[seventh chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, or [[added tone chord]]s. The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note—so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]. To describe this, chords are numbered, using [[Roman numerals]] (upward from the key-note),{{sfn|Schoenberg|1983|loc=1–2}} per their [[diatonic function]]. Common ways of [[#Notation|notating or representing chords]]{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=77}} in western music other than conventional [[staff notation]] include [[Roman numerals#Music theory|Roman numerals]], [[figured bass]] (much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]), [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and various systems of [[chord chart]]s typically found in the [[lead sheet]]s used in [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|popular music]] to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===

In [[music]], harmony is the use of simultaneous [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}} The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|2009}} Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.{{sfn|Jamini|2005|loc=147}} [[Counterpoint]], which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Timbre===
{{Main article|Timbre}}
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and "sweet" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

{{Main article|Dynamics (music)}}
[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]
In music, "[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or "pushed" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').

Greater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''più piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''decrescendo''), often called "[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[marcato]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--The linked article says there are two symbols commonly used to indicate "marcato": the one so indicated here, and the one that is here described as "martellato". Which authority says the latter is incorrect?--&gt; [[tenuto]].]]
Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as "separated" or "detached" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' ("separated", "detached"); ''[[martelé (bowstroke)|martelé]]'' (heavily accented or "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain "in-between" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
{{Main article|Musical texture}}
[[File:Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s "[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]]," mm. 1–7{{audio|Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]
In [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}

Common types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.--&gt;

===Form or structure===
[[File:Canon example.png|thumb|A musical [[canon (music)|canon]]. ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' calls a "canon" both a compositional technique and a musical form.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/canon-music|title=Canon &amp;#124; music|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Musical form}}
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.{{sfn|Brandt|2007}} In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."{{sfn|Scholes|1977}} According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musical form is "the shape or structure of the work." He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a [[Repetition (music)|repeat]]; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: ''how far'', and ''of what type'', different. In many cases, form depends on statement and [[Restatement (music)|restatement]], unity and variety, and [[contrast (music)|contrast]] and connection.{{sfn|Middleton|1999|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}}

===Expression===
{{Main article|Musical expression}}
[[File:1Francisco20violinista.jpg|thumb|Right|220px|A violinist performing]]
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--&gt; Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

===Notation===
{{Main article|Musical notation|Sheet music}}
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|[[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century]]
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==Music theory as academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
{{Main article|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}
[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Melisande]]''
are analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.
{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]
Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards."{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Varèse]]'s claim that, "to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erläuterungen'' ("Elucidations"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8–9, pp. 49–51, vol. 10, pp. 40–2; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201–05; 2, p. 193-97. English translation, ''Der Tonwille'',{{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 2, p. 117-18 (the translation, although made from vols. 8–9 of the German original, gives as original pagination that of ''Das Meisterwerk'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} 1; the text is the same). The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially § 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=§ 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}

===Music perception and cognition===
[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]
{{Further information|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QCfUoD4m7E4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Ethnomusicology+can+benefit+from+psychological+approaches+to+the+study+of+music+cognition+in+different+cultures.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1ffy-zJ_D&amp;sig=MHHfRNiZSsLSqtelThi5cvmrZnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiezMnRypXZAhUJSY8KHVgoApcQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnomusicology%20can%20benefit%20from%20psychological%20approaches%20to%20the%20study%20of%20music%20cognition%20in%20different%20cultures.&amp;f=false|title=Time in Indian Music: Rhythm, Metre, and Form in North Indian Rag Performance|last=Martin|first=Clayton|last2=Clayton|first2=Martin|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195339680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Genre and technique===
{{Main article|Music genre|Musical technique}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008930-0019, Beethovenhalle Bonn, Kammerkonzert Kölner Trio.jpg|thumb|A Classical [[piano trio]] is a group that plays [[chamber music]], including [[sonata]]s. The term "piano trio" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word "form", as part of the compound expression ; the word "style" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or "basic musical language."{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432–33}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that "since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}

Musical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's "most striking and distinctive characteristic" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[étude]]s (meaning "study") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Music and mathematics}}
[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is "the basis of sound" and sound itself "in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties", simply because nature itself "is amazingly mathematical".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42–43}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22–24}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.
[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]
In the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}

===Serial composition and set theory===
[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]
{{Further information|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Integral serialism" or "total serialism" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are "general serialism" and "multiple serialism".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Musical semiotics===

Music semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]] adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The notion of [[Musical Gestures|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in ''Image-Music-Text,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''The Responsibilities of Form,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''Eiffel Tower,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music’s Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===
[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]
Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT&gt;{{cite web|last=McCreless|first=Patrick|title=Society for Music Theory|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT/&gt; This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Société d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be/index.html Société belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Meeùs|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--How competitive is "very"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--&gt; Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an "ABD", for "[[All But Dissertation]]" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11538">'''Nilotic landscape''' is any artistic representation of landscapes that emulates or is inspired by the [[Nile]] river in [[Egypt]]. The term was coined to refer primarily to such landscapes created outside of Egypt, especially in the Aegean, though it is occasionally used to refer to scenes of hunting and fishing in Egyptian art. A nilotic landscape is a river scene with rich and abundant plant and animal life, much of which is native to Egypt. Common iconographic elements include papyrus, palm trees, fish and water birds, and in some cases felines, monkeys, and/or crocodile.

Archaeological evidence attests to painted depictions of the Nile in Egyptian tombs as early as the [[Predynastic]] period. Nilotic scenes remain popular throughout the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and flourish in the [[New Kingdom]]. Of particular prominence are landscapes in tombs paintings of the [[18th dynasty]] of Egypt. Nilotic landscapes are first adapted outside of Egypt in the Aegean, notably in the art of the [[Minoan civilization]]. The subject enjoys a renaissance in Hellenistic and [[Roman art]], when nilotic scenes become a common subject for [[mosaic]]s, most famously the 1st-century BC [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]].  These emphasized the exoticism of the Nile, as well as its busyness as a waterway.  Scenes of water traffic are depicted next to abundant and often dangerous wildlife. 

A number of biblical subjects in art, such as the [[Finding of Moses]], are set in Egypt, and Christian artists slowly evolved modest conventions for conveying the unfamiliar landscape. The process accelelerated after the Renaissance, with [[Nicolas Poussin]], who painted many subjects on the life of [[Moses]], a particular pioneer in developing a more authentic decor.  But the process was slow until the start of the 19th century, with increased Western travel, the advent of modern [[Egyptology]], and in art the development of [[Orientalism]].  By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jason, ''Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology 1: From Antiquity to 1881'', 255, 2015, The American University in Cairo Press, {{ISBN|9774165993}}, 9789774165993, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rd-yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 google books]; Tromans, Nicholas, and others, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'', 2008, [[Tate Gallery|Tate Publishing]], {{ISBN|9781854377333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The production of nilotic landscapes as well as their iconography and interpretations depend on the provenance of the work and the culture in which it was produced, but most scenes on the whole affirm and celebrate the abundance of nature.

==Iconography ==

The most important feature of a nilotic landscape is its riverine setting, which is the ultimate source of any accompanying plant and animal life. The annual flooding of the Nile river in Egypt was not only the source of the ancient civilization’s food and crops, but also provided them with a dependable cyclical calendar. Much of Egypt’s continuity in antiquity, both in society and in art, is thought to stem from the people’s relationship to the Nile. 

[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Menna 004b.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|'''Detail of Papyrus, with a cat stealing the eggs of the water birds.''' From the Tomb of Menna, painted plaster, first half of the 14th century BC, Thebes]]

Nilotic landscapes are filled with abundant plant and animal life. Blue and green pigments often dominate the scene. The [[papyrus]] plant and palm trees are the most recognizable botanic features of a nilotic landscape, along with other plants, often carefully depicted and identifiable. Various animals are represented and vary depending on the specific scene. Many varieties of fish and water birds are found in the scenes, and hunting and fishing scenes usually include cats.  Other nilotic landscapes, especially those outside of Egypt, include exotic, foreign animals, such as monkeys and crocodiles, and often fantastic creatures or monsters like griffins and sphinxes.

==Nilotic landscapes in Egypt==

The phrase "nilotic landscape" is used in Egyptian studies to describe the scenes in tomb paintings where the deceased is engaged in hunting and fishing. These scenes stress the elite character and importance of the deceased, who conquers nature and dominates the landscape, participating in activities reserved for the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Tiradritti, Francesco. (2007). ''Egyptian Wall Painting''. New York: Abbeville Publishing Group (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7892-1005-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Many scenes are symmetrical, with the image of the deceased repeated, first engaged in the act of hunting birds and then spearing fish. The birds and fish often appear in large numbers. They are easily captured by the deceased as they appear to literally fly around him or swim right up to his spear. Thus man is shown in a position of control over nature and the natural world as subservient to his own existence. 

Though these scenes have a centuries-old tradition, they become increasingly popular in the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom, with prominent examples of these scenes discovered in tombs from the necropolis of ancient Thebes in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: ''Hunting in the marsh'',
a fragment of painted plaster from the tomb of Nebamun, ''Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
painted plaster from the tomb of Nakht, and'' Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
Painted plaster from the tomb of Menna)&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically the scenes are characterized by a sense of movement and liveliness not normally seen in most Egyptian works, which for centuries portrayed static, stoic figures and creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. and Christin J. Mamiya. (2004). ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'', Vol. 1. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-534-64095-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample attention paid to detail discernible in the realistic rendering of individual plant and animal species. Variety is imparted by means of these careful details and individualized characterizations.

==Nilotic Landscapes in the Aegean ==

River scenes suggesting the natural world and its lush vegetation begin to appear outside of Egypt contemporaneously with the 18th dynasty, the first extant evidence coming from [[fresco]] fragments of the Minoans. The Aegean version of the nilotic landscape retains many key iconographic elements of the Egyptian version, but the Minoans often make the landscape itself the subject, emphasizing plants and wildlife over human figures (which are generally left out of the work). The compositions are characteristic of the Minoan artistic style, more irregular and informal. Attention is paid to detail and color with respect to plants and animals, but precisely drawn patterns seldom arise and the background and setting may be highly imaginative. They are true frescoes, painted on wet plaster so that the color chemically adheres to the surface, unlike the Egyptian versions.

Nilotic landscapes in Minoan art are evidence of contact between the Minoans and the Egyptians, both through trade and the exchange of ideas. Plants like papyrus and animals like monkeys were not native to [[Crete]]. Many of the plant and animal species are identifiable, confirming not only that the artists paid close attention to detail, but also that they must have been familiar with these species, either through examination of Egyptian painting or, as seems more likely, by means of direct contact with these creatures, plants, and Egyptian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. Vivian and Louise Schofield. (1995). ''Egypt, the Aegean, and the Levant: Interconnections in the Second Millennium BC''. London: British Museum Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7141-0987-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the “House of the Frescoes”, located near the Minoan palace at [[Knossos]], fresco fragments were unearthed depicting blue monkeys and blue birds in a rocky landscape with a winding blue river, along with various types of plants, including papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Arthur. (1936). ''The Palace of Minos at Knossos'', I-IV. London: Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This scene has been dubbed a “nilotic landscape” by archaeologists and art historians due to its inclusion of blue monkeys and papyrus in a riverine setting.

[[File:Akrotiri river.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Detail of Nilotic landscape from Thera, riverine scene with panther chasing ducks]]

Excavations at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] have preserved a number of frescoes dating to the Late Bronze Age. One such scene from the "West House" on the east wall of Room 5 has been termed a nilotic landscape. It features a mix of real and imaginary creatures. A griffin flies over the meandering river, a wild cat stalks ducks, and palm trees pervade. Unlike the two other fresco scenes in this room, the nilotic landscape is devoid of human figures and lacks narrative, focusing instead on the wildlife and environment and glorifying the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Cristos. (1983) ''Thera. Pompeii of the ancient Aegean. Excavations at Akrotiri, 1967-79''. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-500-39016-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of human figures in these Minoan nilotic landscapes has led many archaeologists to assume the presence of a nature goddess or divinity in Minoan religion.&lt;ref&gt;Marinatos, Nanno. (1993). ''Minoan Religion: Ritual, Image, and Symbol''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-87249-744-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name=wordinfo&gt;[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[Nous|nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy ; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; —"[[Omega point]]".}}
The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book,&lt;ref&gt;Glycerio, M. L. &amp; Paulsen, J. B. (1999). Is Noogenesis Progressing? Richmond, VA. [http://sites.google.com/site/pellegrinodellavvenire/la-noosfera-e-lo-sviluppo-del-pensiero/teilhard-de-chardin-and-the-formation-of-the-noosphere/from-noosphere-to-fheosphere-cyclotrons-cyberspace-and-teilhard-de-chardin-vision-of-cosmic-love/noosfera-oggi/is-noogenesis-progressing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart E.

The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);
* Development of an individual mind (ontogenesis );
* Appearance of the Global Intelligence concept.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Several published works which do not employ the term "noogenesis", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: [[working memory]] capacity  ≥ 7,&lt;ref&gt;Read D.W. [http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06676714.pdf Working memory: A Cognitive Limit to Non-Human Primate Recursive Thinking Prior to Hominid Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131072021/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06676714.pdf |date=2012-01-31 }} // Evolutionary Psychology. 2008. — V.6.- P.676-714&lt;/ref&gt; ability to predict, [[prognosis]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Michio Kaku|Kaku M.]] [http://static1.ozone.ru/multimedia/book_file/1010932992.pdf The Future of the Mind. 2015. - 502 p.]&lt;/ref&gt; hierarchical (6 layers neurons) system of information [[analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins J., Blakeslee S.

===Aspects of evolution "sapiens"===
Historical evolutionary development&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 [[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Ch.]] On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. — 1st ed.. — London: John Murray, 1859.]&lt;/ref&gt; and emergence of ''H. sapiens'' as species,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus Carl]] ''Systema naturae sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species.''

D.]], [http://www.google.ru/books?hl=ru&amp;lr=&amp;id=Cp5AAAAAcAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=Dana+J.+D.%5D%5D,+Cephalization+a+Fundamental+Principle+in+the+Development+of+the+System+of+Animal+Life&amp;ots=RkgVtRneHT&amp;sig=DtNdZp2PtVduqJrYVX77HgOi9bA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cephalization a Fundamental Principle in the Development of the System of Animal Life ].

Springer, 1980. pp.141.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, development of an individual's intellect deals with concepts of [[embryogenesis]], [[ontogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Haeckel]] E. Generelle Morphologie der Organismen, 1866 [https://archive.org/stream/generellemorphol01haec/generellemorphol01haec_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; [[morphogenesis]], [[neurogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Zhao C, Deng W, Gage FH.

Despite the fact that the morphofunctional maturity is usually reached by the age of 13, the definitive functioning of the brain structures is not complete until about 16–17 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Farber D. A. Ontogenesis of brain structures// Scientific bases of psychology (ed. by A. A. Smirnova, A. R. Luria, V. D. Nebylitsyn). Moscow:Pedagogika, 1978. P. 255-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of intelligence===
{{Further|Intelligence amplification}}
The fields of [[Bioinformatics]], [[genetic engineering]], [[nootropic|noopharmacology]], [[cognitive load]], [[Deep brain stimulation|brain stimulations]], the efficient use of altered states of consciousness, use of non-human cognition, [[information technology]] (IT), [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) are all believed to be effective methods of intelligence advancement and may be the future of intelligence on earth and the galaxy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil R.]] [http://vesvknigah.ru/24678-evolyuciya-razuma-rey-kurcveyl.html How to Create a Mind. 2015. - 352 p] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131182702/http://vesvknigah.ru/24678-evolyuciya-razuma-rey-kurcveyl.html |date=2016-01-31 }}.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''predicate''' is commonly understood to be a [[Boolean-valued function]] ''P'': ''X''→ {true, false}, called the predicate on ''X''. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], then a predicate is simply the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] (otherwise known as the [[indicator function]]) of a relation.  However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on [[set theory]], and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.

==Simplified overview==
Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Daniel W.|title=A Logical Introduction to Proof|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461436317|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIf3CkTPPjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haas|first=Guy M.|title=What If? (Predicates)|url=http://www.bfoit.org/itp/Predicates.html|work=Introduction to Computer Programming|publisher=Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in IT (BFOIT)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, predicates are sometimes used to indicate set membership: when talking about sets, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements. Thus, a predicate ''P(x)'' will be true or false, depending on whether ''x'' belongs to a set.

Predicates are also commonly used to talk about the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of objects, by defining the set of all objects that have some property in common. So, for example, when ''P'' is a predicate on ''X'', one might sometimes say ''P'' is a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of ''X''.  Similarly, the notation ''P''(''x'') is used to denote a sentence or statement ''P'' concerning the variable object x. The set defined by ''P''(''x'') is written as {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, and is the set of objects for which ''P'' is true.

For instance, {''x'' | ''x'' is a natural number less than 4} is the set {1,2,3}.

If ''t'' is an element of the set {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, then the statement ''P''(''t'') is ''true''.

Here, ''P''(''x'') is referred to as the ''predicate'', and ''x'' the ''placeholder'' of the ''[[proposition]]''. Sometimes, ''P''(''x'') is also called a ([[Template processor|template]] in the role of)  [[propositional function]], as each choice of the placeholder ''x'' produces a proposition.

A simple form of predicate is a [[Boolean expression]], in which case the inputs to the expression are themselves Boolean values, combined using Boolean operations. Similarly, a Boolean expression with inputs predicates is itself a more complex predicate.

== Formal definition==
The precise semantic interpretation of an [[atomic formula]] and an atomic sentence will vary from theory to theory.

* In [[propositional logic]], atomic formulas are called [[propositional variable]]s.&lt;ref name=lavrov&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrov|first=Igor Andreevich|first2=Larisa|last2=Maksimova|author2-link= Larisa Maksimova |title=Problems in Set Theory, Mathematical Logic, and the Theory of Algorithms|year=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0306477122|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPLjjjU1C9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-[[arity]]) predicates. 
* In [[first-order logic]], an atomic formula consists of a predicate symbol applied to an appropriate number of terms. 
* In [[set theory]], predicates are understood to be [[Indicator function|characteristic functions]] or set [[indicator function]]s, ''i.e.'' [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set element to a [[truth value]].  [[Set-builder notation]] makes use of predicates to define sets.
* In [[autoepistemic logic]], which rejects the [[law of excluded middle]], predicates may be true, false, or simply ''unknown''; ''i.e.'' a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.
* In [[fuzzy logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

A '''pseudorandom''' process is a process that appears to be [[randomness|random]] but is not. Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit [[statistical randomness]] while being generated by an entirely [[Deterministic system|deterministic causal process]]. Such a process is easier to produce than a genuinely random one, and has the benefit that it can be used again and again to produce exactly the same numbers, which is useful for testing and fixing software.

To generate truly random numbers would require precise, accurate, and repeatable system measurements of absolutely non-deterministic processes. [[Linux]] uses, for example, various system timings (like user keystrokes, I/O, or least-significant digit voltage measurements) to produce a pool of random numbers. It attempts to constantly replenish the pool, depending on the level of importance, and so will issue a random number. This system is an example, and similar to those of dedicated hardware random number generators. Even with all of this work, it is not truly random.

==History==

The generation of random numbers has many uses (mostly in [[statistics]], for random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]], and [[simulation]]). Before modern computing, researchers requiring random numbers would either generate them through various means ([[dice]], [[playing cards|cards]], [[roulette|roulette wheels]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  etc.) or use existing random number tables.

The first attempt to provide researchers with a ready supply of random digits was in 1927, when the Cambridge University Press published a table of 41,600 digits developed by [[L.H.C. Tippett]]. In 1947, the [[RAND Corporation]] generated numbers by the electronic simulation of a roulette wheel;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1418/index2.html|title=A Million Random Digits {{!}} RAND|website=www.rand.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results were eventually published in 1955  as ''[[A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]]''.

==Almost random==
A pseudorandom variable is a variable which is created by a [[deterministic algorithm]], often a computer program or subroutine, which in most cases takes random bits as input. The pseudorandom string will typically be longer than the original random string, but less random (less [[Information entropy|entropic]] in the [[information theory]] sense). This can be useful for randomized algorithms.

[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely used in such applications as computer modeling (e.g., [[Markov chain]]s), statistics, experimental design, etc.

==In computational complexity==
In [[theoretical computer science]], a [[probability distribution|distribution]] is '''pseudorandom''' against a class of adversaries if no adversary from the class can distinguish it from the uniform distribution with significant advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Goldreich. Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
This notion of pseudorandomness is studied in [[computational complexity theory]] and has applications to [[cryptography]].

Formally, let ''S'' and ''T'' be finite sets and let '''F''' = {''f'': ''S'' → ''T''} be a class of functions.  A [[probability distribution|distribution]] '''D''' over ''S'' is ε-'''pseudorandom''' against '''F''' if for every ''f'' in '''F''', the [[total variation distance|statistical distance]] between the distributions ''f''(''X''), where ''X'' is sampled from '''D''',  and ''f''(''Y''), where ''Y'' is sampled from the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] on ''S'', is at most ε.

In typical applications, the class '''F''' describes a model of computation with bounded resources
and one is interested in designing distributions '''D''' with certain properties that are pseudorandom against '''F'''.  The distribution '''D''' is often specified as the output of a [[pseudorandom generator]].

==Cryptography==

{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}

Though random numbers are needed in [[cryptography]], the use of [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom number generators]] (whether [[Hardware random number generator|hardware]] or [[Random number generation|software]] or some combination) is insecure. When random values are required in cryptography, the goal is to make a message as hard to crack as possible, by eliminating or obscuring the parameters used to encrypt the message (the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) from the message itself or from the context in which it is carried.  Pseudorandom sequences are deterministic and reproducible; all that is required in order to discover and reproduce a pseudorandom sequence is the algorithm used to generate it and the initial [[Seed (randomness)|seed]].  So the entire sequence of numbers is only as powerful as the randomly chosen parts - sometimes the algorithm and the seed, but usually only the seed.

There are many examples in cryptographic history of ciphers, otherwise excellent, in which random choices were not random enough and security was lost as a direct consequence. The [[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese [[PURPLE]] cipher machine used for diplomatic communications is a good example. It was consistently broken throughout World War II, mostly because the "key values" used were insufficiently random. They had patterns, and those patterns made any intercepted traffic readily decryptable. Had the keys (i.e. the initial settings of the stepping switches in the machine) been made unpredictably (i.e. randomly), that traffic would have been much harder to break, and perhaps even secure in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-u-s-cracked-japans-purple-encryption-machine-458385664|title=How the U.S. Cracked Japan's 'Purple Encryption Machine' at the Dawn of World War II|last=Alberto-Perez|work=io9|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In security==

Since pseudorandom numbers are in fact deterministic, a given seed will always determine the same pseudorandom number.  This attribute is used in security, in the form of [[rolling code]] to avoid [[replay attack]]s, in which a command would be intercepted to be used by a thief at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Brain, M., "[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/remote-entry.htm How Remote Entry Works]", ''HowStuffWorks''  Auto Auto Basics. Retrieved July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monte Carlo method simulations==

A [[Monte Carlo method]] simulation is defined as any method that utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation.  Monte Carlo simulations are applied to many topics including [[quantum chromodynamics]], cancer radiation therapy, traffic flow, [[stellar evolution]] and VLSI design.  All these simulations require the use of random numbers and therefore [[pseudorandom number generator]]s, which makes creating random-like numbers very important.

A simple example of how a computer would perform a Monte Carlo simulation is the calculation of [[Pi|π]].  If a square enclosed a circle and a point were randomly chosen inside the square the point would either lie inside the circle or outside it.  If the process were repeated many times, the ratio of the random points that lie inside the circle to the total number of random points in the square would approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square.  From this we can estimate pi, as shown in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code below utilizing a [[SciPy]] package to generate pseudorandom numbers with the [[Mersenne twister|MT19937]] algorithm.  Note that this method is a computationally inefficient way to [[Numerical approximations of π|numerically approximate π]].
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import scipy
N=100000
x_array = scipy.random.rand(N) 
y_array = scipy.random.rand(N) 
# generate N pseudorandom independent x and y-values on interval [0,1)
N_qtr_circle = sum(x_array**2+y_array**2 &lt; 1) 
# Number of pts within the quarter circle x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1 centered at the origin with radius r=1. 
# True area of quarter circle is pi/4 and has N_qtr_circle points within it.
# True area of the square is 1 and has N points within it, hence we approximate pi with
pi_approx = 4*float(N_qtr_circle)/N # Typical values: 3.13756, 3.15156
&lt;/source&gt;

{{quote|text=[Quiet-eye theory] is deceptively simple: Before you perform an action, you focus your gaze on the salient aspects of your goal—the rim, the catcher’s mitt, the malignant tissue, and so on. In recent years, using eye-tracking technology, researchers have found that locking onto the relevant stimulus during the right time frame—typically the few hundred milliseconds before, during and after the movement—greatly improves your chances of success.|author=David Kohn|source=The Atlantic (''What Athletes See'')&lt;ref name="atlantic-2015-11-18"/&gt;}}

==History==

Professor Joan Vickers is credited as the originator of quiet eye theory,&lt;ref name="atlantic-2015-11-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ft-2014-06-16"/&gt; and has been working on the topic since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="cnn-2005-03-21"/&gt;

==Applications and mechanism==

Quiet eye theory can be used both to predict performance,&lt;ref name="cnn-2005-03-21"/&gt; and sometimes, as ''quiet eye training'', as a means to improve performance.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="causer-et-al-2014"/&gt;

Quiet eye training is hypothesised to work by improving attentional control, allowing greater cognitive effort to be devoted to the principal task and as such improving motor learning and the robustness of motor skills under pressure.&lt;ref name="behan-2008"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:AB Keeled Scales.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Keeled scales of a [[colubrid]] snake (buff-striped keelback; ''[[Amphiesma stolatum]]'')]]
In most [[biology|biological]] nomenclature, a '''scale''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:λεπίς|λεπίς]] ''lepis'', [[Latin language|Latin]] ''squama'') is a small rigid [[Plate (animal anatomy)|plate]] that grows out of an [[animal]]'s [[skin]] to provide protection.  In [[lepidoptera]]n ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, scales are plates on the surface of the [[insect wing]], and provide coloration.  Scales are quite common and have evolved multiple times through [[convergent evolution]], with varying structure and function.

Scales are generally classified as part of an organism's [[integumentary system]].  There are various types of scales according to shape and to [[class (biology)|class]] of animal.

==Fish scales==
[[File:Scale Common Roach.JPG|thumb|Cycloid scales on a [[common roach]] (''Rutilus rutilus'')]]
{{main|Fish scale}}
Fish scales are [[skin|dermally]] derived, specifically in the [[mesoderm]]. This fact distinguishes them from reptile scales paleontologically.
Genetically, the same genes involved in tooth and hair development in mammals are also involved in scale development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. T.| title = Fish scale development: Hair today, teeth and scales yesterday?| journal = Current Biology| volume = 11| last1 = Sharpe| issue = 18| pages = R751–R752| year = 2001| pmid = 11566120| doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00438-9    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Coelacanth]] --&gt;
True cosmoid scales can only be found on the [[Sarcopterygian]]s. The inner layer of the scale is made of [[lamellar]] bone. On top of this lies a layer of spongy or [[Blood vessel|vascular]] bone and then a layer of [[dentine]]-like material called [[cosmine]]. The upper surface is [[keratin]]. The [[coelacanth]] has modified cosmoid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true cosmoid scales.

===Ganoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gar]] --&gt;
Ganoid scales can be found on [[gar]]s (family [[Lepisosteidae]]), [[bichir]]s, and reedfishes (family [[Polypteridae]]). Ganoid scales are similar to cosmoid scales, but a layer of [[ganoin]] lies over the cosmine layer and under the enamel{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}. Ganoin scales are diamond shaped, shiny, and hard. &lt;!-- Which is it, enamel or dentine?  Only dentine mentioned previously. --&gt; 
Within the ganoin are [[guanine]] compounds, iridescent derivatives of guanine found in a DNA molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 =Levy-Lior | first1 =A. | last2 =Pokroy | first2= B. | last3 =Levavi-Sivan | first3 =B. | last4 =Leiserowitz |first4 = L.| last5 =Weiner | first5 =S. |last6 =Addadi | first6 =L. | title =Biogenic guanine crystals from the skin of fish may be designed to enhance light reflectance | journal = Crystal growth and design | year =2008 | volume =8 | issue =2 | pages = 507–511 |doi=10.1021/cg0704753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iridescent property of these chemicals provide the ganoin its shine.

===Placoid scales===
[[Placoid scale]]s are found on [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] including [[shark]]s. These scales, also called denticles, are similar in structure to [[tooth|teeth]], and have one median spine and two lateral spines.

===Leptoid scales===
Leptoid scales are found on higher-order bony fish.  As they grow they add concentric layers. They are arranged so as to overlap in a head-to-tail direction, like roof tiles, allowing a smoother flow of water over the body and therefore reducing [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn = 978-1-118-92421-1| last1 = Ballard| first1 = Bonnie| last2 = Cheek| first2 = Ryan | title = Exotic Animal Medicine for the Veterinary Technician | date = 2 July 2016 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1_NDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT786&amp;dq=leptoid%20scale&amp;pg=PT786#v=onepage&amp;q=leptoid%20scale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They come in two forms:

*'''Cycloid scales''' have a smooth outer edge, and are most common on fish with soft fin rays, such as [[salmon]] and [[carp]].
*'''Ctenoid scales''' have a toothed outer edge, and are usually found on fish with spiny fin rays, such as [[Bass (fish)|bass]] and [[crappie]].

==Reptilian scales==
[[File:Gold Dust Day Gecko closeup hawaii edit 1.jpg|thumb|Brightly colored scales on a [[gold dust day gecko]]]]
{{main|Reptile scales}}

[[Reptile]] scale types include: cycloid, granular (which appear bumpy), and keeled (which have a center ridge). Scales usually vary in size, the stouter, larger scales cover parts that are often exposed to physical stress (usually the feet, tail and head), while scales are small around the joints for flexibility. Most snakes have extra broad scales on the belly, each scale covering the belly from side to side.

The scales of all reptiles have an epidermal component (what one sees on the surface), but many reptiles, such as [[crocodilian]]s and turtles, have [[osteoderm]]s underlying the epidermal scale. Such scales are more properly termed [[scute]]s. Snakes, [[tuatara]]s and many lizards lack osteoderms. All reptilian scales have a dermal papilla underlying the epidermal part, and it is there that the osteoderms, if present, would be formed.

==Avian scales==
[[File:Riesenseeadler Fang.JPG|thumb|Scales on talons of a [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''Haliaeetus pelagicus'')]] 
{{main|Bird anatomy#Scales}}
Birds' scales are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. The scales and scutes of birds were thought to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to those of reptiles,&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Alfred M. |year=1972 |title=Avian Anatomy - integument |location=East Lansing, Michigan, USA |publisher=USDA Avian Anatomy Project, Michigan State University |pages=67, 344, 394–601}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now agreed to have evolved independently, being degenerate feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Zhang, F., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., ... &amp; Xu, X. (2013). Hind wings in basal birds and the evolution of leg feathers. Science,339(6125), 1309-1312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, R. H., &amp; Knapp, L. W. (2003). Avian skin development and the evolutionary origin of feathers. Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution, 298(1), 57-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalian scales==
An example of a scaled mammal is the [[pangolin]]. Its scales are made of keratin and are used for protection, similar to an [[armadillo]]'s armor. They have been convergently evolved, being unrelated to the animal's distant reptile ancestors, except that they use a similar gene.

On the other hand, the [[musky rat-kangaroo]], has scales on its feet and tail&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest-Australia.com&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030065952/http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The precise nature of its purported scales has not been studied in detail, but they appear to be structurally different from pangolin scales.

[[Anomalure]]s also have scales on their tail undersides.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Theodore (1984). Macdonald, D., ed. The Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York: Facts on File. p. 632. {{ISBN|0-87196-871-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foot pad epidermal tissues in most mammal species have been compared to the scales of other vertebrates. They are likely derived from cornification processes or stunted fur much like avian reticulae are derived from stunted feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ian Campbell Spearman, The Integument, CUP Archive, 28/06/1973 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthropod scales==
[[Butterflies]] and [[moth]]s - the order [[Lepidoptera]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] "scale-winged") - have membranous wings covered in delicate, powdery scales, which are modified [[setae]].  Each scale consists of a series of tiny stacked platelets of organic material, and butterflies tend to have the scales broad and flattened, while moths tend to have the scales narrower and more hair like.  Scales are usually [[pigment]]ed, but some types of scales are metallic, or iridescent, without pigments; because the thickness of the platelets is on the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] the plates lead to structural coloration and [[iridescence]] through the physical phenomenon described as [[thin-film optics]]. The most common color produced in this fashion is [[blue]], such as in the ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies. Other colors can be seen on the [[Chrysiridia rhipheus|sunset moth]].

The '''soliton hypothesis''' in [[neuroscience]] is a [[biological neuron models|model]] that claims to explain how [[action potentials]] are initiated and conducted along [[axon]]s based on a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse propagation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=S|last2=Jackson|first2=A|last3=Heimburg|first3=T|title=Towards a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse propagation|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=2009|volume=88|pages=104–113|url=http://www.membranes.nbi.dk/pdf/2009_AndersenJacksonHeimburg_PNB.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that the signals travel along the cell's [[cell membrane|membrane]] in the form of certain kinds of [[Solitary wave (water waves)|solitary]] [[sound]] (or [[density]]) pulses that can be modeled as [[soliton]]s.

==History==

[[Ichiji Tasaki]] pioneered a thermodynamic approach to the phenomenon of nerve pulse propagation which identified several phenomena that were not included in the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].&lt;ref name=Tasaki&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasaki|first1=Ichiji|title=Physiology and Electrochemistry of Nerve Fibers|date=1982|publisher=Academic Press Inc.

==Justification==
The model starts with the observation that cell membranes always have a [[melting point|freezing point]] (the temperature below which the consistency changes from fluid to gel-like) only slightly below the organism's body temperature, and this allows for the propagation of solitons. An action potential traveling along a mixed nerve results in a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1958.0012 |author=Abbott, B.C., Hill, A.V., Howarth, J.V. |title=The positive and negative heat associated with a nerve impulse |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=148 |issue=931 |pages=149–187 |year=1958 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/148/931/149.abstract?sid=55350fa9-13b9-4280-90f3-99a1fc01b2c5|bibcode = 1958RSPSB.148..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soliton model proponents claim that no net heat is released during the overall pulse and that the observed temperature changes are inconsistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, this is untrue: the Hodgkin Huxley model predicts a biphasic release and absorption of heat.&lt;ref name="Howarth Heat Review" /&gt; In addition, the AP causes a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iwasa, K., Tasaki I., Gibbons, R. |title=Swelling of nerve fibres associated with action potentials |journal=Science |volume=210 |issue=4467 |pages=338–9 |year=1980 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;210/4467/338?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Iwasa%2C+K&amp;andorexacttitle=or&amp;andorexacttitleabs=or&amp;andorexactfulltext=or&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=1/1/1980&amp;tdate=12/31/1980&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT,HWELTR |pmid=7423196 |doi=10.1126/science.7423196 |bibcode=1980Sci...210..338I}}&lt;/ref&gt; this effect is not predicted by the Hodgkin–Huxley model but does not contradict it, either.

The soliton model attempts to explain the electrical currents associated with the action potential as follows: the traveling soliton locally changes density and thickness of the membrane, and since the membrane contains many charged and [[chemical polarity|polar]] substances, this will result in an electrical effect, akin to [[piezoelectricity]]. Indeed, such nonlinear sound waves have now been shown to exist at lipid interfaces that show superficial similarity to action potentials (electro-opto-mechanical coupling, velocities, biphasic pulse shape, threshold for excitation etc.).&lt;ref name="shrivastava" /&gt; Furthermore, the waves remain localized in the membrane and do not spread out in the surrounding due to an impedance mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griesbauer|first1=J|last2=Wixforth|first2=A|last3=Schneider|first3=M F|title=Wave Propagation in Lipid Monolayers|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=15 Nov 2009|volume=97|issue=10|pages=2710–2716|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.049|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0006349509013150/1-s2.0-S0006349509013150-main.pdf?_tid=af52937a-e9cf-11e4-8cfd-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1429804073_add2909d02a98a7343eb4804fe059cf0|pmid=19917224|pmc=2776282|bibcode=2009BpJ....97.2710G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these mechanical waves differ in fundamental ways from the properties described by the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] in that they do not exhibit the very specific ionic selectivity, voltage sensitivity, time-course, or sensitivity to toxins that are integral to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

==Formalism==

The soliton representing the action potential of nerves is the solution of the [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 \Delta \rho}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\left(c_0^2 + p\Delta \rho + q\Delta \rho^2\right)\frac{\partial \Delta \rho}{\partial x}\right] - h\frac{\partial^4 \Delta\rho}{\partial x^4}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is time and {{math|''x''}} is the position along the nerve axon. {{math|Δ''ρ''}} is the change in membrane density under the influence of the action potential,  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the sound velocity of the nerve membrane, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} describe the nature of the phase transition and thereby the nonlinearity of the elastic constants of the nerve membrane. The parameters {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are dictated by the thermodynamic properties of the nerve membrane and cannot be adjusted freely. They have to be determined experimentally. The parameter {{math|''h''}} describes the frequency dependence of the sound velocity of the membrane ([[dispersion relation]]). The above equation does not contain any fit parameters. It is formally related to the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq approximation]] for solitons in water canals. The solutions of the above equation possess a limiting maximum amplitude and a minimum propagation velocity that is similar to the pulse velocity in myelinated nerves. Under restrictive assumptions, there exist periodic solutions that display hyperpolarization and refractory periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Villagran Vargas, E., Ludu, A., Hustert, R., Gumrich, P., Jackson, A.D., Heimburg, T. |title=Periodic solutions and refractory periods in the soliton theory for nerves and the locust femoral nerve |year=2010 |pmid=21177017 |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.11.001 |volume=153 |issue=2–3 |pages=159–167 |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |arxiv=1006.3281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of ion channels==
Advocates of the soliton model claim that it explains several aspects of the action potential, which are not explained by the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Since it is of thermodynamic nature it does not address the properties of single macromolecules like [[ion channel]] proteins on a molecular scale. It is rather assumed that their properties are implicitly contained in the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the nerve membranes. The soliton model predicts membrane current fluctuations during the action potential. These currents are of similar appearance as those reported for ion channel proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.02.018 |author=Heimburg, T. |title=Lipid Ion Channels |journal=Biophys. Chem. |volume=150 |issue=1–3 |pages=2–22 |year=2010 |arxiv=1001.2524 |pmid=20385440}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be caused by lipid membrane pores spontaneously generated by the thermal fluctuations. Such thermal fluctuations cannot explain the specific ionic selectivity or the specific time-course of the response to voltage changes.

==Application to anesthesia==
The authors claim that their model explains the previously obscure mode of action of numerous [[anesthetic]]s. The [[Minimum alveolar concentration#Meyer-Overton hypothesis|Meyer–Overton observation]] holds that the strength of a wide variety of chemically diverse anesthetics is proportional to their [[lipid]] solubility, suggesting that they do not act by binding to specific [[protein]]s such as ion channels but instead by dissolving in and changing the properties of the lipid membrane. Dissolving substances in the membrane lowers the membrane's freezing point, and the resulting larger difference between body temperature and freezing point inhibits the propagation of solitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heimburg, T., Jackson, A.D. |title=The thermodynamics of general anesthesia |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=3159–65 |url=http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(07)71124-4 |year=2007 |pmid=17293400 |pmc=1852341 |doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.099754 |bibcode=2007BpJ....92.3159H|arxiv = physics/0610147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing pressure, lowering [[pH]] or lowering temperature, this difference can be restored back to normal, which should cancel the action of anesthetics: this is indeed observed. The amount of pressure needed to cancel the action of an anesthetic of a given lipid solubility can be computed from the soliton model and agrees reasonably well with experimental observations.

==Differences between model predictions and experimental observations==
[[File:BBM equation - overtaking solitary waves animation.gif|thumb|208px|Collision of solitons]]
The following is a list of some of the disagreements between experimental observations and the "Soliton model":

;Antidromic invasion of soma from axon: An action potential initiated anywhere on an axon will travel in an antidromic (backward) direction to the neuron soma (cell body) without loss of amplitude and produce a full-amplitude action potential in the soma. As the membrane area of the soma is orders of magnitude larger than the area of the axon, conservation of energy requires that an adiabatic mechanical wave decrease in amplitude. Since the absence of heat production is one of the claimed justifications of the 'soliton model', this is particularly difficult to explain within that model.&lt;ref&gt;Rall, W and Shepherd, GM (1968) Theoretical reconstructions of dendrodendritic synaptic interactions in the olfactory bulb. ''J Neurophysiol'' 31, 884-915.http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/31/6/884.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

;Persistence of action potential over wide temperature range: An important assumption of the soliton model is the presence of a phase transition near the ambient temperature of the axon ("Formalism", above). Then, rapid change of temperature away from the phase transition temperature would necessarily cause large changes in the action potential. Below the phase transition temperature, the soliton wave would not be possible. Yet, action potentials are present at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. The time course is slowed in a manner predicted by the measured opening and closing kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodgkin | first1 =  | last2 = Katz | first2 =  | year = 1949 | title = The Effect of Temperature on the Electrical Activity of the Giant Axon of the Squid | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392577/pdf/jphysiol01472-0254.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J.

;Ionic currents under voltage clamp: The voltage clamp, used by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ([[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]) to experimentally dissect the action potential in the squid giant axon, uses electronic feedback to measure the current necessary to hold membrane voltage constant at a commanded value. A silver wire, inserted into the interior of the  axon, forces a constant membrane voltage along the length of the axon. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a traveling 'soliton'. Any thermodynamic changes are very different from those resulting from an action potential. Yet, the measured currents accurately reproduce the action potential. (citation needed)

;Single channel currents: The patch clamp technique isolates a microscopic patch of membrane on the tip of a glass pipette. It is then possible to record currents from single ionic channels. There is no possibility of propagating solitons or thermodynamic changes. Yet, the properties of these channels (temporal response to voltage jumps, ionic selectivity) accurately predict the properties of the macroscopic currents measured under conventional voltage clamp.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"&gt;Hille, Bertil (2001). Ion channels of excitable membranes (3. ed. ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer. {{ISBN|9780878933211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (citation needed)

;Selective ionic conductivity: The current underlying the action potential depolarization is selective for sodium. Repolarization depends on a selective potassium current. These currents have very specific responses to voltage changes which quantitatively explain the action potential. Substitution of non-permeant ions for sodium abolishes the action potential. The 'soliton model' cannot explain either the ionic selectivity or the responses to voltage changes. ( [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] )(citation needed)

;Pharmacology: The drug tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks action potentials at extremely low concentrations. The site of action of TTX on the sodium channel has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Catterall | first1 = WA | year = 2014 | title = Structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels at atomic resolution | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969/full | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 35–51 | doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969| pmc = 3885250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrotoxins block the potassium channels. These drugs produce quantitatively predictable changes in the action potential.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"/&gt; The 'soliton model' provides no explanation for these pharmacological effects.

==Action waves==

A recent theoretical model, proposed by Ahmed El Hady and Benjamin Machta, proposes that there is a mechanical surface wave which co-propagates with the electrical action potential. These surface waves are called "action waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms7697 |author=El Hady, A., Machta, B.|title=Mechanical surface waves accompany action potential propagation |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=6 |year=2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150330/ncomms7697/full/ncomms7697.html |pages=6697|arxiv=1407.7600 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6697E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the  El Hady–Machta's model, these co-propagating waves are driven by voltage changes across the membrane caused by the action potential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71060">The '''spiral of silence theory''' is a [[political science]] and [[mass communication]] theory proposed by the [[Germany|German]] [[political scientist]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], which stipulates that individuals have a fear of [[solitude|isolation]], which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Background==
According to Shelly Neill, "Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure."{{Sfn|Neill|2009|p=42}} The spiral of silence theory suggests that "people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Applicatinon|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|location=New York|pages=411|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. "As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} "In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the [[spiral]] refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} The following steps summarize how the process works:
#We can distinguish between fields where the opinions and attitudes involved are static, and fields where those opinions and attitudes are subject to changes... Where opinions are relatively definite and static – for example, "customs" – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.
#Individuals who, when observing their environments, notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and is taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#It follows from this that, as the representatives of the first opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent, there is a definite influence on the environment: an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

This is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

Further, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a [[Positive feedback|dynamic process]], in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]] becomes the [[status quo]], and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=278}}

==Epistemology==
===Public===
Scholars have long argued over the concept of ''public'' within "public opinion". The use of "[[public]]" and "the public" betrays multiple competing meanings.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Opinion===
"Common [[Opinion]]" is what the Scottish social philosopher [[David Hume]] called it in his 1739 published work ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French "opinion."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} In researching the term opinion, ''meinung'' in German, researchers were led back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In Plato's ''Republic'', a quote from [[Socrates]] conclude that opinion takes the middle position. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered opinion to be an "insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively."{{Sfn|Kant|1781|p=498}} How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Public opinion===
The term [[public opinion]] first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase ''[[public opinion]].'' [[Hermann Oncken]], a German historian, stated &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a [[Proteus]], a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was said to be a "fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. "The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

The American sociologist [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward Ross]] described [[public opinion]] in 1898 using the word "cheap". "The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Many possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than "on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is this Thing we Call Public Opinion? Reflections on the Spiral of Silence|url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/368|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 September 2012|issn=0954-2892|pages=368–386|volume=24|issue=3|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds014|language=en|first=Kurt|last=Lang|first2=Gladys Engel|last2=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book "Public Opinion," published in 1923.&lt;ref name="Lippmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippmann|first1=W|title=Public opinion|date=1946|publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states "the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noelle-Neumann|first1=Elisabeth|title=The spiral of silence: Public opinion, our social skin|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda-setting theory]] is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media.&lt;ref name="AgendaSetting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaw|first2=D. L|date=1972|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990|last1=McCombs|first1=M. E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; The media battles with these news alternatives by creating "pseudo-crises" and "pseudo-novelties."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Media's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a "one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the [[conversation]]."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic Needle model]],&lt;ref name="CommChar" /&gt; the spiral model assumes an active audience "who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals."&lt;ref name="CommChar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball-Rokeach|first1=S|last2=Cantor|first2=M. G|title=Media, audience, and social structure|date=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge "gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The spiral of silence: examining how cultural predispositions, news attention, and opinion congruency relate to opinion expression|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=2013-04-01|issn=0129-2986|pages=113–134|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|first=Shirley S.|last=Ho|first2=Vivian Hsueh-Hua|last2=Chen|first3=Clarice C.|last3=Sim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho et al. point out that "among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Noelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=C. J|last2=McLeod|first2=J.M|title=Implications of the spiral of silence theory for communication and public opinion research|journal=Political communication yearbook|date=1984|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennamer|first1=J.D|title=Self-serving biases in perceiving the opinions of others: Implications for the spiral of silence|journal=Communication Research|date=1990|doi=10.1177/009365090017003006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=393–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the "micro-climate" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media.&lt;ref name="Kennamer" /&gt; Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=P. J|last2=Wackman|first2=D. B|title=Mass media and community public opinion|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=1973|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000276427301600408|pages=593–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
===Fear of isolation===
The fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence.{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] in the [[Asch conformity experiments]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2012}} People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

===Assessing the climate===
This assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiman|first1=Gabriel|title=Communicating Unreality|date=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quasi-statistical sense====
Individuals use what is described as "an innate ability" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2005|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}
{{Quote|The [[Mass media]] play a large part in determining what the dominant opinion is, since our direct observation is limited to a small percentage of the population. The mass media have an enormous impact on how public opinion is portrayed, and can dramatically impact an individual's perception about where public opinion lies, whether or not that portrayal is factual.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} }}

====Pluralistic ignorance====
[[Pluralistic ignorance]] may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=J. Nicole|title=Intergroup Contact and Pluralistic Ignorance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=91–107|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.91|pmid=15631577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of public opinion matters===
Our evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a ''vocal minority'' (the complement of the ''[[silent majority]]'') by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=279}} It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are "people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the [[avant-garde]] are "the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}}

==Application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena,&lt;ref name=PopCulture&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedel|first1=T|title=The spiral of silence in popular culture: applying a public opinion theory to radio station popularity|journal=California State University|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to smoking.{{Sfn|Shanahan|Scheufele|Yang|Hizi|2004}} Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component,&lt;ref name=NoelleBook /&gt; many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAbortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=C.T|last2=Neuwirth|first2=k|title=Perceptions of opinion "climates" and willingness to discuss the issue of abortion|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1990|volume=67|issue=3|pages=567–577|doi=10.1177/107769909006700312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[affirmative action]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAffirmative&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=P|last2=Domke|first2=D|last3=Stamm|first3=K|title=The spiral of silence and public opinion on affirmative action|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2001|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.1177/107769900107800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=SpiralOnCapital&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=A.F|title=Exploring the Forms of Self-Censorship: On the Spiral of Silence and the Use of Opinion Expression Avoidance Strategies|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=4|pages=785–802|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social [[conformity]] and [[culture]], motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of [[psychology]] in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion.&lt;ref name=Milgram&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milgram|first1=S|title=Nationality and conformity|journal=Scientific American|date=1961|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45|volume=205|issue=6|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a [[meta-analysis]] regarding [[Asch conformity experiments]], for example, suggest that [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.&lt;ref name=MetaAsch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Rod|last2=Smith|first2=Peter B.|title=Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=1|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States and Taiwan====
''A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence'' by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is [[individualistic culture|an "individualistic" society]], while Taiwan is a "[[collectivist]]" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the "I" identity over the "we" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including [[self-efficacy]] and [[self-assurance]].

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in [[Somalia]], and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose "favor," "neutral" or "oppose" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the [[individualism]] and collectivism constructs, and the "motives of not expressing opinion" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it "unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion." Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.{{Sfn|Huang|2005}}

====Basque nationalism====
''Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence'' is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as "How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a "fear of isolation" in regards to fellow [[Basques]]. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.{{Sfn|Spencer|Stephen|2008}}

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study, by Henson and Denker "investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, [[political affiliation]], and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university [[classroom climate]]s and [[communication behavior]]s."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The goal of the article was to "determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], [[cultural communication|cultural]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[political communication]]. Henson and Denker said, "Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and [[political ideology|ideological]] differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on [[face-to-face interaction]] before 2000, the theory was later applied to a [[computer-mediated communication]] environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDevitt|first1=M.|title=Spiral of Moderation: Opinion Expression in Computer-Mediated Discussion|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=454–470|doi=10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name=OnlineKorea&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung Choi|first1=Yun|last2=Lee|first2=Cheolhan|last3=Hyuk Lee|first3=Jong|title=Influence of poll results on the advocates' political discourse: An application of functional analysis debates to online messages in the 2002 Korean presidential election|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1080/0129298042000195189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silence in the crowd: The spiral of silence contributing to the positive bias of opinions in an online review system|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/17/11/1811|journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]]|date=1 December 2015|issn=1461-4448|pages=1811–1829|volume=17|issue=11|doi=10.1177/1461444814535190|language=en|first=David A.|last=Askay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended "into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms" and "the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression" is also addressed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===In social media contexts===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the [[social media]] context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users "who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Was It Something I Said?"

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to [[social capital]] context. Recent studies see social capital as "a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Social Capital and the Spiral of Silence|last=Dalisay|first=Francis|date=2012|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds023|pmid=|accessdate=|last2=Hmielowski|first2=Jay D.|last3=Kushin|first3=Matthew James|last4=Yamamoto|first4=Masahiro|volume=24|issue=3|pages=325–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--[[civic engagement]], trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the study shows that "only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Internet==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as [[social withdrawal]], defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction.{{Sfn|O'Connor|1969}}{{Sfn|O'Connor|1972}} Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of [[peer rejection]].{{Sfn|Gottman|Gonso|Rasmussen|1975}} Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings{{Sfn|Kraut|Patterson|Lundmark|Kiesler|1998}}{{Sfn|Moody|2001}}{{Sfn|Sleek|1998}} or how the Internet decreases [[social isolation]] of people by allowing them to expand their [[social network]]s and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family.{{Sfn|Morris|Ogan|2002}}{{Sfn|Bradley|Poppen|2003}} Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the [[World Wide Web]], a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[newsgroup]]s, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial [[virtual communities]].{{Sfn|Sassenberg|2002}} The theories and hypotheses about how [[Internet]]-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, [[online game]]s, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.{{Sfn|Rheingold|1993}}{{Sfn|Cummings|Sproull|Kiesler|2002}}{{Sfn|McKenna|Bargh|1998}}

Traditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the [[peer group]] and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers.{{Sfn|Bowker|Bukowski|Zargarpour|Hoza|1998}} From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever.{{Sfn|Witschge|2002}} Witschge further explained, "Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully."{{Sfn|Witschge|2002|p=8}}

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that "Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own."{{Sfn|van Alstyne|Brynjolfsson|1996|p=24}} The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it "makes manageable large-scale, [[many-to-many]] discussion and deliberation."{{Sfn|Coleman|Gøtze|2001|p=17}} Unlike [[traditional media]] that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.{{Sfn|O'Hara|2002}}

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many [[reference group|reference]] and [[social group]]s are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009|p=36}} Liu and Fahmy stated that "it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group."{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in [[online forum]]s (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nekmat|author2=Gonzenbach|journal=JMCQ|year=2013|volume=90|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"/&gt;

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, "The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other."{{Sfn|Page|1996|p=124}} The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as [[chat room]]s and newsgroups.{{Sfn|Wanta|Dimitrova|2000}}{{Sfn|O'Sullivan|1995}}{{Sfn|Sproull|Kiesler|1992}}{{Sfn|Hiltz|Johnson|Turoff|1986}}

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|pp=124–25}}

The groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}} Stromer-Galley considered that "an absence of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.{{Sfn|Stromer-Galley|2002|p=35}}

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[computer-mediated communication]], physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Second, a great deal of [[normative influence]] is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as [[eye contact]] and [[gestures]],{{Sfn|Burgoon|Buller|Woodall|1989}} but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal [[social context]] cues convey formality and status inequality in [[face-to-face communication]].{{Sfn|Keisler|Siegel|McQuire|1984}} When these cues are removed, the importance of [[social status]] as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment.{{Sfn|Williams|1977}} The form and consequences of [[conformity]] influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the [[social presence]] of participants.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Social presence is defined as the degree of [[salience (language)|salience]] of the other person in the interaction{{Sfn|Short|Williams|Christie|1976}} or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.{{Sfn|Rice|Williams|1984}}

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and [[equal opportunities]] to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a [[deliberation]]. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by [[pecking order|dominant others]], or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the [[social hierarchies]] and power relations that exist offline: "The 'blindness' of [[cyberspace]] to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the [[social position]] of the poster".{{Sfn|Dahlberg|2001|p=14}}

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: "if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation".{{Sfn|Gastil|2000|p=359}} While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens [[stereotyping]] and [[prejudice]].{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}}

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. [[Racism]], [[ageism]], and other kinds of [[discrimination]] against out groups "seems to be diminishing because the cues to [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] status are not as obvious".{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|p=99}} Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, [[Information sharing|share]] and [[information organization|organize]] [[information]],{{Sfn|Warren|2001}} realizing more equality of [[information access|access to information]].{{Sfn|Gimmler|2001}}

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through [[Opinion poll|survey]]s&lt;ref name=Method&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuwirth|first1=K|title=The Spiral of Silence and Fear of Isolation|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=450–468|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this [[methodology]] as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Talk: Manipulating the Dependent Variable in Spiral of Silence Research|journal=Communication Research|date=1 June 2001|volume=28|issue=3|pages=304–324|doi=10.1177/009365001028003003|last1=Scheufele|first1=D. A.|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|last3=Lee|first3=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among different approaches to survey methodology, [[cross-sectional study]] design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory.&lt;ref name=Method /&gt; Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Method" /&gt;

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed [[panel data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Cheryl|title=Popularity in a Freefall: Measuring a Spiral of Silence at the End of the Bush Presidency|last2=Baldassare|first2=Mark|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1994|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1093/ijpor/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is "observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it "leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.{{Sfn|Moy|Domke|Stamm|2001}}

Scholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person "has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures.{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's "perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=J.|title=Observing the "Spiral" in the Spiral of Silence|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–176|date=2014|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edu032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Legacy of Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann: The Spiral of Silence and Other Controversies|last=Splichal|first=Slavko|date=2015|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323115589265|pmid=|access-date =|volume=30|issue=3|pages=353–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that "it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion "is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
Research indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of "recognizing cognitive bias" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked  or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Scott Percival (2012). "The Myth of the Closed Mind: Explaining why and how People are Rational".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Fusari (2014).

In this image most krill swim in an upside down position directly under the ice. Only one animal (in the middle) is hover in the open water.]]

A '''sympagic''' environment is one where water exists mostly as a solid, [[ice]], such as a [[polar ice cap]] or [[glacier]]. Solid [[sea ice]] is permeated with channels filled with salty brine. These briny channels and the sea ice itself have its ecology, referred to as "sympagic ecology".

Residents of [[temperate]] or [[tropical]] climates often assume, mistakenly, that ice and snow are devoid of life. In fact, a number of varieties of [[algae]] such as [[diatom]]s engage in [[photosynthesis]] in [[arctic]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]] regions of Earth. Other energy sources include Aeolian [[dust]] and [[pollen]] swept in from other regions. These ecosystems also include [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]], as well as [[animal]]s like [[Platyhelminthes|flatworms]] and [[crustacean]]s.  A number of sympagic worm species are commonly called [[ice worm]]s.

Additionally, the ocean has abundant [[plankton]], and prolific [[algal bloom]]s occur in the polar regions each summer as well as in high mountain lakes, bringing nutrients to those parts of the ice in contact with the water.

In the spring, [[krill]] can scrape off the green lawn of [[ice algae]] from the underside of the ''pack ice.''

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report. 

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years.This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that’s even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know."''&lt;ref name=conflicts&gt;{{cite news|title=Google slams U.S. government in latest transparency report|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063386/google-slams-u-s-government-in-latest-transparency-report.html|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=PC WORLD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Our ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.”''avian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter sues US government for right to disclose NOTHING|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/twitter_sues_us_government_for_right_to_disclose_nothing/|publisher=The register|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published.
The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the ''Washington Post''.
[[Google]], [[Twitter]],and [[Facebook]] all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meghan Kelly|title=U.S. to release transparency report with FISA and national security requests|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/us-transparency-report/|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''transparent eyeball''' is a philosophical metaphor originated by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The transparent eyeball is a representation of an eye that is absorbent rather than reflective, and therefore takes in all that [[nature]] has to offer.  Emerson intends that the individual become one with nature, and the transparent eyeball is a tool to do that. In the book ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', Emerson explains that the meaning behind the transparent eyeball is similar to a scientific standpoint on the [[Bible]].

==Overview==
The idea of the transparent eyeball first appeared in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay, ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', published in 1836.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt; In this essay, Emerson describes [[nature]] as the closest experience there is to experiencing the presence of [[God]]. To truly appreciate nature, one must not only look at it and admire it, but also be able to feel it taking over the senses.  This process requires absolute "solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society"&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"&gt;{{cite web | date = Feb 2011 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= http://seniorseminarsp2011.qwriting.org/files/2011/02/Emerson-Nature-and-Circles.pdf |title= Emerson, nature &amp; circles | work = Ralph Waldo Emerson Essays and Lectures|publisher = Q Writing | origyear = The Library of America 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; to uninhabited places like the woods where—
{{quote| We return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, — no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite spaces, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7" /&gt;}}

However, only a "few adult persons can see nature."&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt;  For most people seeing is superficial.  It is light illuminating the [[eye]] revealing what is physically evident as opposed to sun "shine[s] into the eye and heart of the child."&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"/&gt; "Emerson argues that outer and inner vision merge to reveal symbols in the natural landscape. Because of the radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, natural facts serve as symbols of spiritual facts, so the natural world is perpetual allegory of the human spirit—an allegory to which the eye gives access."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"&gt;{{cite web |page=25 |year=2004 |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/v013/13.2kohler.pdf | format = PDF | title= Dickinson's Embodied Eyeball: Transcendentalism and the Scope of Vision| last = Kohler | first = Michelle |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hello: in the midst of wild Nature, the self becomes one with being and god; differentiation, alienation and struggle cease."&lt;ref name = "DeathEmerson2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Death of Emerson: Writing, Loss, and Divine Presence |author=Atchley, J. Heath |work=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, New Series |year=2006 |pages=251–265| volume=20 |number=4 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v020/20.4atchley.html |accessdate=13 April 2011| publisher= Penn State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"For Emerson, every object rightly seen unlocks a new faculty of the soul and, while he ardently valorizes the physical eye’s potential to see in a way that discovers symbolic meaning, his most memorable metaphorical image for such potential, the transparent eyeball, posits a vision wherein the eye sloughs off its body and ‘egotism,’ merging with what it sees. It is within this transparent, disembodied state of total union with nature that Emerson claims ‘I am nothing; I see all’. The ‘all’ that Emerson seeks access is not simply harmony with nature or even knowledge, but perception of a deep unity between the human spirit and the natural world."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"/&gt;

==Origin==
Emerson attended [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1825—and by 1826, had applied for a license to preach at the Middlesex Association of Ministers.  By 1832, Emerson left the Christian ministry but continued to believe in God. However, he held that God reveals his grandeur not only in scripture, but also through nature. “Emerson's reading in science soon after leaving the ministry was his effort to interpret God's natural book. As Emerson became increasingly interested in science, he eventually came to believe nature, not scripture, was the locus of [[revelation]]. His desire to become a naturalist was intimately connected to his yearning to write a new bible of [[God]]'s revelation in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = "Terrible Simplicity": Emerson's Metaleptic Style | journal = Style | type = academic journal article | last = Wilson | first = Eric | volume = 31 | number = 1 | date = Spring 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2013}} believe that the “transparent eyeball” passage is an echo of the [[Bible]]. ‘In Nature, Emerson fashions himself as a new prophet of nature, believing with [[Goethe]] that "prophetic vision" arises only in "slowpaced experiment." Vision arises from observing nature, where, as he writes in Nature, "All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature." The essay can be regarded as Emerson's attempt to make nature itself a bible. In this sense, one need not spend Sundays at church but could simply retreat to the ‘woods’ and let nature inhabit his or her consciousness.  “The reconstruction of religion in Emerson’s nature works in a number of directions. First, there is an undeniable romantic-[[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in his writings. One can and should go out into nature, into the fields and forests and be renewed. It follows, then, that Emerson’s religiosity may be read as natural and not supernatural, which may account for his centrality in a tradition of arts and letters which dates to his decisive split with organized religion.” The significance of this shift resulted in Emerson’s paradigmatic role for [[transcendentalism]].  “Transcendentalists believe that finding God depended on neither orthodox ([[Christianity]]) nor the Unitarians' sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit.”{{Sfn | Wilson | 1997}}

==Application==

===In photography===
[[Walker Evans]] is a renowned American photographer, known for his visionary process of aligning “photography with Emerson's original desire to absorb and be absorbed into nature, to become a transparent rather than simply reflective eye.” Walker spent his career during the [[Great Depression]] trying to capture images that would be a mirror representation of Americans surrounded by both nature and man-made objects existing in total harmony.

Emerson's description of the “transparent eyeball” functions as a metaphor for the artist's ability to discern the essential nature of objects and as a way to stress that the transcendental is not formless.  The "transparent eyeball" reflects nature's particulars, much in the way that a [[camera]] lens exposes; and in the process illuminates… the "unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory" facts. The transparent eyeball is about capturing and being a part of all of nature and its motion. The camera works in the same fashion. The camera exposes/illuminates all of nature in a single snapshot with more detail and visibility of nature that cannot be taken in by an unaided eye alone.
{{Quote | Just as nature has to be experienced visually for its true meaning to shine forth, the photographic eye has to be present to capture the image. Contrary to what one might think, the ‘transparent eyeball’ is not a free-floating entity, but a necessary link between the observer and the landscape surrounding him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ‘The Transparent Eyeball’: On Emerson and Walker Evans | last = Blinder | first = Caroline | journal = Mosaic | place = Winnipeg | volume = 37 | number = 4 | date = December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To visually experience and appreciate nature, as Emerson desired, through a transparent state, an individual has to view it. This is similar to the camera. To photograph an image, the individual must first view the scene, then capture what they see.  Thus, the “transparent eyeball” is not free from constraints, but is a tool that the individual needs to become one with nature. However, it is not to be understood that “Emerson did not believe in a fundamental god-driven unity underlying the worldly flux, but rather that art's role was to provide an insight into that unity.”{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===In literature===
According to Amy Hungerford, the influence and use of the transparent eyeball in [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Marilynne Robinson]]’s novel [[Housekeeping (novel)|Housekeeping]] is palpable.  Hungerford argues that Robinson’s protagonist Ruth narrates from the perspective of the transparent eyeball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://academicearth.org/speakers/amy-hungerford | contribution = Amy Hungerford | publisher = Academic earth | title = Speakers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
[[Annie Dillard]], a prominent critic of [[transcendentalism]], suggests a rather different kind of observer—one conscious of their own embodiment, of a "particularity" in space and time, of [[subjectivity]], of the [[constructiveness]], the "falseness" of vision.  Dillard’s vision is different from Emerson’s because she is conscious of her presence, so she can pay attention to the “falseness” of vision. In this sense, it is safer not to attain nor aim for the transparent eyeball ideal, because vision is limited, and one should “not stalk the truth” of the places where it could be seen.{{Citation needed |date=March 2015}}

An '''unrestricted algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for the computation of a mathematical function that puts no restrictions on the range of the argument or on the precision that may be demanded in the result.&lt;ref name="Clenshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=C.W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver|title=An unrestricted algorithm for the exponential function|journal=SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis|date=April 1980|volume= 17|issue=2|pages=310–331|jstor=2156615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of such an algorithm was put forward by C. W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver in a paper published in 1980.&lt;ref name=Clenshaw/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard P Brent|chapter=Unrestricted algorithms for elementary and special functions|title=Information Processing |volume=80  |editor=S. H. Lavington |publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam|date=1980|pages=613–619|arxiv=1004.3621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the problem of developing algorithms for computing the values of a real-valued function of a real variable, say ''g''(''x''), in "restricted" algorithms, the error that can be tolerated in the result is specified in advance. An interval on the real line would also be specified for values where in the values of function are to be evaluated. Different algorithms may have to applied for evaluating functions outside the interval. An unrestricted algorithm envisages a situation in which a user may stipulate the value of ''x'' and also the precision required in ''g''(''x''), quite arbitrarily. The algorithm should then produce an acceptable result without failure.&lt;ref name = Clenshaw/&gt;
