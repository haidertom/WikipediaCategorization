'''Animal magnetism''', also known as ''mesmerism'', was the name given by German doctor [[Franz Mesmer]] in the 18th century to what he believed to be an invisible natural force (''Lebensmagnetismus'') possessed by all living things, including humans, animals, and vegetables. He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing, and he tried persistently but without success to achieve scientific recognition of his ideas.&lt;ref name=wolfart&gt;Wolfart, Karl Christian; Friedrich Anton Mesmer. ''Mesmerismus: Oder, System der Wechselwirkungen, Theorie und Anwendung des thierischen Magnetismus als die allgemeine Heilkunde zur Erhaltung des Menschen'' (in German, facsimile of the 1811 edition). Cambridge University Press, 2011. {{ISBN|9781108072694}}. Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vitalism|vitalist]] theory attracted numerous followers in Europe and the United States and was popular into the 19th century. Practitioners were often known as '''magnetizers''' rather than '''mesmerists'''. It was an important specialty in medicine for about 75 years from its beginnings in 1779, and continued to have some influence for another 50 years. Hundreds of books were written on the subject between 1766 and 1925, but it is almost entirely forgotten today.&lt;ref name=Crabtree&gt;Adam Crabtree ''Animal Magnetism, Early Hypnotism, and Psychical Research, 1766–1925 – An Annotated Bibliography'' {{ISBN|0-527-20006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesmerism is still practised as a form of alternative medicine in some countries, but magnetic practices are not recognized as part of medical science.

== Etymology and definitions ==

==="Magnetizer"===
The terms "magnetizer" and "mesmerizer" have been applied to people who study and practice animal magnetism.&lt;ref name ="Notre Famille" &gt;Dictionnaire Notre Famille, (1987), [http://www.notrefamille.com/dictionnaire/definition/magnetiseur ''Magnetiseur''], notrefamille.com. Accessed 19 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have been distinguished from "mesmerist" and "magnetist", which are regarded as denoting those who study animal magnetism without being practitioners;&lt;ref name="Durville"&gt;[[Hector Durville]], ''Theory and Animal Magnetism procedures'', Rio de Jan ed. Léon Denis, 2012 {{ISBN|978-85-7297-510-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and from "hypnotist", someone who practises [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref name="Durville"/&gt;

The etymology of the word ''magnetizer'' comes from the French "''magnetiseur''" ("practicing the methods of [[mesmerism]]"),&lt;ref name = "Notre Famille"/&gt; which in turn is derived from the French verb ''magnetiser''.&lt;ref&gt;Thouvenel, Pierre, [http://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/rarebooks/item/698/thouvenel-p.-second-m%C3%A9moire-physique-et-m%C3%A9dicinal-montrant-des-rapports-%C3%A9videns-entre-les-ph%C3%A9nomenes-de-la-baguette-divinatoire,-du-magn%C3%A9tisme-et-de-l'%C3%A9lectricit%C3%A9.-avec-des-%C3%A9claircissemens-sur-d'autres-objets-non-moins-importans,-qui-y-sont-relatifs,-1784.''Mémoire et medical physique''] Paris Ed. Didot Chez le jeune, Quai des Auguftins. (1781) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to an individual who has the power to manipulate the "magnetic fluid"&lt;ref&gt;[[Baron du Potet]], '' Student Handbook Magnetizer '', ed. Life – 3rd Edition, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; with effects upon other people present that were regarded as analogous to [[magnet]]ic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Anton Mesmer]], '' Memoire sur la découverte du animals magnétisme '', 1779, [[File:Wikisource-logo.svg|19x19px]] Édition numérique disponible [[wikisource: Mémoire sur la découverte du animals magnétisme|sur Wikisource]]. Il ya aussi une édition papier chez Allia, 2006 {{ISBN|2844852262}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of the term is found, for example, in the expression of [[Antoine Joseph Gorsas]]: "The magnetizer is the imam of vital energy".&lt;ref&gt;Gorsas, Antoine-Joseph, ''L'Ane promeneur'', 1784, p. 41 and p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Mesmerism"===
A tendency emerged amongst British magnetizers to call their clinical techniques "mesmerism"; they wanted to distance themselves from the theoretical orientation of animal magnetism that was based on the concept of "magnetic fluid".  At the time, some magnetizers attempted to channel what they thought was a magnetic "fluid", and sometimes they attempted this with a "[[laying on of hands]]". Reported effects included various feelings: intense heat, trembling, trances, and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;Connor C. (2005). ''A People's History of Science'', Nation Books, pp. 404–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many practitioners took a scientific approach, such as [[Joseph Philippe François Deleuze]] (1753–1835), a French physician, anatomist, gynecologist, and physicist.  One of his pupils was [[Théodore Léger]] (1799–1853), who wrote that the label "mesmerism" was "most improper".&lt;ref name="Léger, 1846, p.14"&gt;Léger, 1846, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; (Léger moved to Texas around 1836).

Noting that, by 1846, the term "[[galvanism]]" had been replaced by "electricity", Léger wrote that year:&lt;ref name="Léger, 1846, p.14"/&gt;
{{quotation|'''''Mesmerism''''', of all the names proposed [to replace the term animal magnetism], is decidedly the most improper; for, in the first place, no true science has ever been designated by the name of a man, whatever be the claims he could urge in his favor; and secondly, what are the claims of Mesmer for such an honor? He is not the inventor of the practical part of the science, since we can trace the practice of it through the most remote ages; and in that respect, the part which he introduced has been completely abandoned. He proposed for it a theory which is now [viz., 1846] exploded, and which, on account of his errors, has been fatal to our progress. He never spoke of the phenomena which have rehabilitated our cause among scientific men; and since nothing remains to be attributed to Mesmer, either in the practice and theory, or the discoveries that constitute our science, why should it be called mesmerism?}}

==Royal Commission==
In 1784 a French Royal Commission appointed by [[Louis XVI]] studied Mesmer's magnetic fluid theory to try to establish it by scientific evidence. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The commission included Majault, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], J. B. Le Roy, Sallin, [[Jean Darcet]], de Borey, [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], Poissonnier, [[Claude-Antoine Caille|Caille]], Mauduyt de la Varenne, Andry, and [[de Jussieu]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Whilst the commission agreed that the cures claimed by Mesmer were indeed cures{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, it also concluded there was no evidence of the existence of his "magnetic fluid", and that its effects derived from either the imaginations of its subjects or [[charlatan]]ry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Royal Academy investigation==
A second investigating committee, appointed by a majority vote in 1826 in The Royal Academy of Medicine in Paris, studied the effects and clinical potentials of the mesmeric procedure - without trying to establish the physical nature of any magnetic fluidum. The report says:
{{quotation|what we have seen in the course of our experiments bears no sort of resemblance to what the Report of 1784 relates with regard to the magnetizers of that period. We neither admit nor reject the existence of the fluid, because we have not verified the fact ; we do not speak of the ''baquet'' ... nor of the assemblage of a great number of people together, who were magnetized in the presence of a crowd of witnesses ; because all our experiments were made in the most complete stillness ... and always upon a single person at a time. We do not speak of ... the ''crisis''&lt;ref&gt;COLQUHOUN, John Campbell, [http://www.forgottenbooks.com/books/Isis_Revelata_v2_1000899412 Isis Revelata, Volume 2], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Among the conclusions were:
{{quotation|Magnetism has taken effect upon persons of different sexes and ages. ... In general, magnetism does not act upon persons in a sound state of health. ... Neither does it act upon all sick persons.

... we may conclude with certainty that this state exists, when it gives rise to the development of new faculties, which have been designated by the names of ''[[clairvoyance]]''; ''[[intuition]]''; internal ''prevision''; or when it produces great changes in the physical economy, such as [[insensibility]]; a sudden and considerable increase of strength; and when these effects cannot be referred to any other cause.

... We can not only act upon the magnetized person, but even place him in a complete state of [[somnambulism]], and bring him out of it without his knowledge, out of his sight, at a certain distance, and with doors intervening.

... The greater number of the somnambulists whom we have seen, were completely insensible ... we might pinch their skin, so as to leave a mark, prick them with pins under the nails, &amp;c. without producing any pain, without even their perceiving it. Finally, we saw one who was insensible to one of the most painful operations in surgery, and who did not manifest the slightest emotion in her countenance, her pulse, or her respiration.

... Magnetism is as intense, and as speedily felt, at a distance of six feet as of six inches; and the phenomena developed are the same in both cases.

...Magnetism ought to be allowed a place within the circle of medical sciences...&lt;ref&gt;COLQUHOUN, John Campbell, [http://www.forgottenbooks.com/books/Isis_Revelata_v2_1000899412 Isis Revelata, Volume 2], pp. 283-293&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Mesmerism and hypnotism==

[[Abbé Faria]] was one of the disciples of [[Franz Anton Mesmer]] who continued with Mesmer's work following the conclusions of the Royal Commission. In the early 19th century, Abbé Faria is said to have introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris&lt;ref&gt;See Carrer (2004), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; and to have conducted experiments to prove that "no special force was necessary for the production of the mesmeric phenomena such as the trance, but that the determining cause lay within the subject himself"—in other words, that it worked purely by the power of suggestion.&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;Hull, Clark L. "Hypnotism in Scientific Perspective", ''The Scientific Monthly'' 29.2 (1929): p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypnosis|Hypnotism]], a designation coined by the Scottish surgeon, [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]],&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, (2013), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; originates in Braid's response to an 1841 exhibition of "animal magnetism", by [[Charles Lafontaine]], in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles de la Tourette. "The Wonders of Animal Magnetism", ''The North American Review'' 146.375 (1888): p.131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1851, Braid was adamant that, in the absence of the sorts of "higher phenomena" reportedly produced by the mesmerists,
&lt;blockquote&gt;and in contra-distinction to the ''Transcendental'' [i.e., ''metaphysical''] ''Mesmerism'' of the Mesmerists … [allegedly] induced through the transmission of an occult influence from [the body of the operator to that of the subject,] ''Hypnotism'', [by which] I mean a peculiar condition of the nervous system, into which it can be thrown by artificial contrivance … [a theoretical position that is entirely] consistent with generally admitted principles in physiological and
psychological science [would] therefore [be most aptly] designated ''Rational Mesmerism''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1PQ0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Braid (1850), p.6].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vital fluid and animal magnetism==
A 1791 London publication explains Mesmer's theory of the vital fluid :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Modern philosophy has admitted a plenum or universal principle of fluid matter, which occupies all space; and that as all bodies moving in the world, abound with pores, this fluid matter introduces itself through the interstices and returns backwards and forwards, flowing through one body by the currents which issue therefrom to another, as in a magnet, which produces that phenomenon which we call Animal Magnetism. This fluid consists of fire, air and spirit, and like all other fluids tends to an equilibrium, therefore it is easy to conceive how the efforts which the bodies make towards each other produce animal electricity, which in fact is no more than the effect produced between two bodies, one of which has more motion than the other; a phenomenon serving to prove that the body which has most motion communicates it to the other, until the medium of motion becomes an equilibrium between the two bodies, and then this equality of motion produces animal electricity.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonders and mysteries of animal magnetism displayed; or the history, art, practice, and progress of that useful science, from its first rise in the city of Paris, to the present time. With several Curious Cases and new Anecdotes of the Principal Professors''. Eighteenth Century Collections Online. London (1791): pp.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to an anonymous writer of a series of letters published by editor John Pearson in 1790, animal magnetism can cause a wide range of effects ranging from vomiting to what is termed the "crisis". The purpose of the treatment (inducing the "crisis") was to shock the body into convulsion in order to remove obstructions in the humoral system that were causing sicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1790), p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this anonymous supporter of the animal magnetism theory purported that the "crisis" created two effects: first, a state in which the "[individual who is] completely reduced under Magnetic influence, although he should seem to be possessed of his senses, yet he ceases to be an accountable creature",&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1790), pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and a second "remarkable" state, which would be "conferred upon the [magnetized] subject … [namely] that of perfect and unobstructed vision … in other words, all opacity is removed, and every object becomes luminous and transparent".&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1790), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; A patient under crisis was believed to be able to see through the body and find the cause of illness, either in themselves or in other patients.

The [[Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur|Marquis of Puységur]]'s miraculous healing of a young man named Victor in 1784 was attributed to, and used as evidence in support of, this "crisis" treatment. The Marquis was allegedly able to hypnotize Victor and, while hypnotized, Victor was said to have been able to speak articulately and diagnose his own sickness.

Jacob Melo discusses in his books some mechanisms by which the perceived effects of animal magnetism have been claimed to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture given at the [http://jacobmelo.webs.com/Jornal%20Vortice/JORNAL%20VORTICE%2024%20MAIO%202010.pdf III World Meeting of Magnetizers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social skepticism in the Romantic Era ==
[[File:AMesmerianExperimentogv.ogv|thumb|335x335px|A caricature of Mesmer filmed by [[Georges Méliès|George Mèliés]], 1905]]

The study of animal magnetism spurred the creation of the Societies of Harmony in France, where members paid to join and learn the practice of magnetism. Doctor John Bell was a member of the Philosophical Harmonic Society of Paris, and was certified by the society to lecture and teach on animal magnetism in England.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, John, Professor of Animal Magnetism. ''“The general and particular principles of animal electricity and magnetism, &amp;c. in which are found Dr. Bell's secrets and practice, AS Delivered To His Pupils in Paris, London, Dublin, Bristol, Glocester, Worcester, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Chester, Liverpool, Manchester, &amp;c. &amp;c. Shewing how to Magnetise and Cure different Diseases; to produce Crises, as well as Somnambulism, or [[Sleepwalking|Sleep-Walking]]; and in that State of Sleep to make a Person eat, drink, walk, sing and play upon any Instruments they are used to, &amp;c. to make Apparatus and other Accessaries to produce Magnetical Facts; also to Magnetise Rivers, Rooms, Trees, and other Bodies, animate and inanimate; to raise the Arms, Legs of a Person awake, and to make him rise from his Chair; to raise the Arm of a Person absent from one Room to another; also to treat him at a Distance. All the New Experiments and Phenomena are explained by Monsieur le Docteur Bell, Professor of that Science, And Member of the Philosophical Harmonic Society at Paris, Fellow Correspondent of M. Le Court de Geblin's Museum; and the only Person authorised by Patent from the First Noblemen in France, to teach and practise that Science in England, Ireland, &amp;c.”''  Price Five Shillings. Eighteenth Century Collections Online. [London](1792): p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the societies transformed animal magnetism into a secretive art, where its practitioners and lecturers did not reveal the techniques of the practice based on the society members that have paid for instruction, veiling the idea that it was unfair to reveal the practice to others for free.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, John (1790). ''A plain account'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Although the heightened secrecy of the practice contributed to the skepticism about it, many supporters and practitioners of animal magnetism touted the ease and possibility for everyone to acquire the skills to perform its techniques.&lt;ref&gt;“Wonders and mysteries of animal magnetism displayed; or the history, art, practice, and progress of that useful science, from its first rise in the city of Paris, to the present time. With several Curious Cases and new Anecdotes of the Principal Professors.” Eighteenth Century Collections Online. London (1791): p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularization of animal magnetism was denounced and ridiculed by newspaper journals and theatre during the Romantic Era. Many deemed animal magnetism to be nothing more than a theatrical falsity or quackery. In a 1790 publication, an editor presented a series of letters written by an avid supporter of animal magnetism and included his own thoughts in an appendix stating: 
“No fanatics ever divulged notions more wild and extravagant; no impudent empiric ever retailed promises more preposterous, or histories of cures more devoid of reality, than the tribe of magnetisers.”&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, John (1790). ''A plain account'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist and playwrighter [[Elizabeth Inchbald]] wrote the farce ''Animal Magnetism'' in the late 1780s. The plot revolved around multiple love triangles and the absurdity of animal magnetism. The following passage mocks the medical prowess of those qualified only as mesmerists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Doctor: They have refused to grant me a diploma—forbid me to practice as a physician, and all because I don't know a parcel of insignificant words; but exercise my profession according to the rules of reason and nature; Is it not natural to die, then if a dozen or two of my patients have died under my hands, is not that natural? …&lt;ref&gt;Inchbald, Elizabeth. ''Animal Magnetism''. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although the doctor's obsession with the use of animal magnetism, not merely to cure but to force his ward to fall in love with him, made for a humorous storyline, Inchbald’s light-hearted play commented on what society perceived as threats posed by the practice.

De Mainanduc brought animal magnetism to England in 1787 and promulgated it into the social arena. In 1785, he had published proposals to the ladies of Britain to establish a "hygean society" or society of health, by which they would pay to join and enjoy his treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Wonders and mysteries of animal magnetism displayed; or the history, art, practice, and progress of that useful science, from its first rise in the city of Paris, to the present time. With several Curious Cases and new Anecdotes of the Principal Professors. Eighteenth Century Collections Online. London (1791): p.7&lt;/ref&gt; As both popularity and skepticism increased, many became convinced that animal magnetism could lead to sexual exploitation of women. Not only did the practice involve close personal contact via the waving of hands over the body, but people were concerned that the animal magnetists could hypnotize women and direct them at will.

{{Quote
|text=Having removed all misconceptions, foretelling of the future, explicit or implicit invocation of the devil, the use of animal magnetism is indeed merely an act of making use of physical media that are otherwise licit and hence it is '''not morally forbidden''', provided it does not tend toward an illicit end or toward anything depraved. (''The Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office'': 28 July 1847.)
}}

== Political influence ==

The French revolution catalyzed existing internal political friction in Britain in the 1790s; a few political radicals used animal magnetism as more than just a moral threat but also a political threat.  Among many lectures warning society against government oppression, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
William Pitt, the great political Animal Magnetist, ... has most foully worked on the diseased fancy of Englishmen ... thrown the nation into a feverish slumber, and is now bringing it to a crisis which may convulse mortality!&lt;ref&gt;Requoted from: Fulford, Tim. "Conducting and Vital Fluid: The Politics and Poetics of Mesmerism in the 1790s", ''Studies in Romanticism'' 43.1 (2004): pg.1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Major politicians and people in power were accused by radicals of practising animal magnetism on the general population.

In his article "Under the Influence: Mesmerism in England", Roy Porter notes that [[James Tilly Matthews]] suggested that the French were infiltrating England via animal magnetism. Matthews believed that "magnetic spies" would invade England and bring it under subjection by transmitting waves of animal magnetism to subdue the government and people.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Roy. "UNDER THE INFLUENCE: MESMERISM IN ENGLAND," ''History Today'' 35.9 (1985): pg.28&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an invasion from foreign influences was perceived as a radical threat.

==Mesmerism and spiritual healing practices==
Today, some scholars{{Who|date=November 2018}} believe mesmerism to share a concept of life force or energy with such Asian practices as ''[[reiki]]'' and ''[[qigong]]''.  However, the practical and theoretical positions of such practices are on whole substantially different from those of mesmerism.

During the Romantic period, mesmerism produced enthusiasm and inspired horror in the spiritual and religious context. Though discredited as a credible medical practice by many, mesmerism created a venue for spiritual healing. Some animal magnetists advertised their practices by stressing the "spiritual rather than physical benefits to be gained from animal magnetism" and were able to gather a good clientele from among the spiritually inspired population.&lt;ref&gt;Fara.

Some researchers, including [[Johann Peter Lange]]&lt;ref&gt;LANGE, Johann Peter, ''A Commentary on the Holy Scriptures: Kings'', Ed. C. Scribner &amp; Company, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;LANGE, Johann Peter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Io1TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=Jesus++animal+magnetism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I0EDQG5rE_&amp;sig=PShNc3gAGJMjrCNh4iFK6UnHRhA&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=27YeVenXIcifsAXY4IGYCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Jesus%20%20animal%20magnetism&amp;f=false ''The Life of The Lord Jesus Christ: A Complete Critical Examination of the Origin, Contents and Connection of the Gospels, Volume 1''], Ed.

Other writers, such as [[John Campbell Colquhoun]]&lt;ref&gt;COLQUHOUN, John Campbell,  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3lHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Jesus++animal+magnetism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NoJe1Z5O7O&amp;sig=5yS--Ry7yRWYz3-tKQg2re_gY48&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=27YeVenXIcifsAXY4IGYCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Jesus%20%20animal%20magnetism&amp;f=false An History of Magic, Witchcraft, and Animal Magnetism, Volume 1]'', Ed.

Eddy, Boston, 1934. pp.101&lt;/ref&gt;, denounced the comparison. Mary Baker Eddy went so far as to claim animal magnetism "lead to moral and to physical death."

==Contemporary development==
Sporadic research into animal magnetism was conducted in the 20th century, and the results published; for example, Bernard Grad wrote a number of papers related to his observations of "a single, reputed healer, [Hungarian] Oskar Estebany" on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Gauld, (1992), pp.254-255, 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional magnetizers ==
In the Classical era of animal magnetism, the late 17th century to the mid-19th century, there were professional magnetizers,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Rausky, ''Mesmer ou la révolution thérapeutique'' ("Mesmer, or the therapeutic revolution"), Paris, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; whose techniques were described by authors of the time as particularly effective. Their method was to spend prolonged periods "magnetizing" their customers directly or through "mesmeric magnets". It was observed that in some conditions, certain mesmerizers were more likely to achieve the result than others, regardless of their degree of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Durville"/&gt;

'''Anthropological theories of value''' attempt to expand on the traditional [[Value theory|theories of value]] used by [[economics|economists]] or [[value theory|ethicists]]. They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx]], etc. usually including [[sociological]], [[political]], institutional, and [[historical]] perspectives ([[transdisciplinarity]]).  Some have influenced [[feminist economics]].

The basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of "value" is a [[social construct]], and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics.  [[Anthropological linguistics]] is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within.  Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.

[[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed.  [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed.  Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family [[Antique|heirloom]]s).

== Value as meaning-making ==
[[David Graeber]] attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human [[meaning-making]]. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of "objects that are not consumed" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|date=2001|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]|isbn=0-312-24044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of things that are neither consumption nor production ===
{{synthesis|date=February 2015}}
A list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00141844.1999.9981601 | last1 = Owens | first1 = Bruce McCoy | year = 1999| title = Unruly Readings: Neofetishes, Paradoxical Singularities, and the Violence of Authentic Value, | url = | journal = Ethnos | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–262 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Economists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time.  Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading.  Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment.  In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption &amp;ndash; for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself.  In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming &amp;ndash; the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation).  Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. [[Gary Becker]]'s [[household production function]]s and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce [[utility]]).

In the theory of [[Autowave|autowave phenomena]] an '''autowave reverberator''' is an autowave [[vortex]] in a two-dimensional [[Excitable medium|active medium]].&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt;

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a ''[[spiral wave]]'', which rotates around the obstacle, or an ''autowave reverberator'' which rotates with its tip free.

== Introduction ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
The ''reverberator'' was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object.

Up until the late 20th century, the term "''auto-wave reverberator''" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in [[USSR]] (for more details, see "A brief history of autowave researches" in [[Autowave]]). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Volobuev-1997en"/&gt;), the term "''autowave reverberator''" became known also in English-speaking countries.

The ''reverberator'' is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the ''spiral wave''. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave!

However, it must be remembered that many features of ''rotating autowaves'' were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s,  and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed  knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little-known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic.  Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings „Autowave processes in systems with diffusion“,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt; in 2009.

The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused.

It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.

=== "Historical" definition ===

{{centered pull quote|An important difference between a reverberator and a spiral wave rotating around the hole, which is similar to reverberator in the form, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property, reverberators can appear and disappear at different locations of the medium.

Важным отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся  вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать и исчезать в разных местах среды.

A ''rotating autowave'' in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'', ''rotor'', ''vortex'' or even ''scroll wave''. However, one should take into account that these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ordinarily, the term "spiral wave" refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term "rotor".&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; However,  we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is  taken already to call [[Rotor (electric)|the moving part of an electric motor]], and, in addition, the term is used in the [[Curl (mathematics)|mathematical theory of the field]]). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the term "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a two-dimensional vortex (and this is plain truth from the point of view of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking ahead, we say that a ''simple scroll'' is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms "scroll" and "reverberator" in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In light of these terminological remarks, we will write "'''2D-autovortex'''" ("'''two-dimensional autowave vortex'''") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium ;  and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, "spiral wave" or "reverberator".

Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны ''спиральными волнами'' (''spiral wave''), ''ревербераторами'', ''роторами'' (''rotor''), ''автоволновыми вихрями'' (''vortex'') или даже ''свитками'' (''scroll wave''). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь  автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в  своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком ('''''простым свитком''''') называют такой трехмерный вихрь,  который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде  автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение '''''2D-автовихрь''''' ('''''двумерный автоволновой вихрь'''''), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

== Types of  reverberator behaviour ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== The "classical" regimes ===

[[File:Diagram of reverberator evolution in FitzHugh-Nagumo model.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the evolution of reverberator for FitzHugh-Nagumo model (in accordance with the results of A.&amp;nbsp;Winfrey&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt;): ''β'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to the excitation threshold, ''ε'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to  relaxation ability of the active medium, ''∂P'' — "the propagation boundary", out which any autowave propagation is impossible, ''∂R'' — the boundary of existence of the reverberators (the "rotor boundary"), ''∂M'' —  the meander boundary, ''∂C'' — the boundary of hyper-meander.]]

Various autowave regimes, such as ''plane waves''  or ''spiral waves'' can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|FitzhHugh-Nagumo model]] for a generic active medium, [[Arthur Winfree|Winfree]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; constructed a diagram  depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called ''flower gardens'' since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ''∂P'', which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and ''plane autowaves'' can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the "rotor boundary" ''∂R'', which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the ''meander'' boundary ''∂M'' and the ''hyper-meander'' boundary ''∂C'', which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ''∂R''.

Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models — Beeler-Reuter model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-1995"/&gt; Barkley model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Belinec-1977"/&gt; Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; Fenton-Karma model etc.

It was also shown&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of [[differential equation]]s of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations.

In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of ''uniform circular rotation''), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the ''tip of the reverberator''). The autowave  cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of  reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called ''the core of the reverberator''. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of "infinite" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;  The certain  size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory tail]].

As the ''critical size'' of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator  behaviour on conductivity  of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that the critical size of the reverberator  and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)

=== Regimes of induced drift  ===

At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave.

However, in result of  the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is  the works Biktasheva,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2010"/&gt; where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Davydov-1988"/&gt; who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator).

In particular, Biktashev offers&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt; to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium:
# Resonant drift.
# Inhomogeneity induced drift.
# Anisotropy induced drift.
# Boundary induced drift  (see also&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;).
# Interaction of spirals.
# High frequency induced drift.

Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should  not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of  the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely ''the spontaneous drift of the reverberator''. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.

=== Autowave lacet  ===

In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; the phenomenon of [[bifurcation memory]] was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from ''meander'' to ''uniform circular rotation''; this new regime was named ''autowave lacet''.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;

Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory.

When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the ''meander'' exist ever or the halt of the reverberator  drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of ''meander'' and ''lacet'' revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander,  a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity.

The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for [[cardiology]]. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave "sticks" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition  from  polymorphic to monomorphic [[tachycardia]]  is observed on the [[ECG]] in such cases. This phenomenon is called the "''anchoring''" of spiral wave.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kukushkin-2004"/&gt;
However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet&lt;!-- (see. Fig.) --&gt;; in other words, the ''lacet'' may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2007b"/&gt; Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called "lacetic",&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Moskalenko-2012"/&gt; which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.

== The reasons for distinguishing between variants of rotating autowaves  ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
Recall that from 1970th&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: 
# wave in the ring, 
# spiral wave,
# autowave reverberator.

[[File:Сritical size of reverberator.png|thumb|300px|left|Critical size of reverberator (reconstructed on the base of data of {{nobr|A.M. Percov}} and {{nobr|A.V. Panfilov}},&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; obtained for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model). '''A'''.&amp;nbsp;The relation between the critical size and the size of the core. '''Б'''.&amp;nbsp;The dependence of the critical sizes of the reverberator and the autowave running around the ring on the conduction of rapid current ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; . '''В'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the period of the reverberator and the running around the ring on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. '''Г'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the refractoriness of the medium(''R'') on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for the plane wave (curvature ''k''=0.83) and the plane wave.]]
Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of ''critical curvature''. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non-zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium  before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry.

The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics  of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.
&lt;!-- 
More details about the causes of distinguishing between these three variants will be described in section "[[Автоволны/Вращающаяся автоволна|Вращающаяся автоволна]]"

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Negligent use of special terms even in scientific literature during the forty years of research of the autowave processes (approximately 1970 to 2010) resulted in rather a lot of confusion in the usage of the names of the rotating autowave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9375">'''Bisha'a''' or '''Bisha''' (ordeal by fire, trial by fire or fire test) is a [[ritual]] practiced by [[Bedouin]] tribes of the [[Judea]]n, [[Negev]] and [[Sinai]] deserts for the purpose of [[lie detection]]. It is also practiced, and is said to have originated among, some Bedouin tribes of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is the best-known of various forms of [[trial by ordeal]] which are practiced by the Bedouin, which are now dying out. It is one of the rituals in the [[Bedouin systems of justice|Bedouin justice dispensary system]] for maintaining [[Honor codes of the Bedouin|Sharaf]] - the Bedouin honor code.

==Ritual==
The basic ritual consists of the accused being asked to lick a hot metal object (spoon, ladle, rod, etc.) thrice. He is provided with water for rinsing after the ceremony. He is then inspected by the official who presides over the ceremony - the ''Mubesha'' (or ''Mubasha'') and by the designated witnesses of the ritual. If the person undergoing the ritual is found to have a scarred or burnt [[tongue]], it is concluded that he was lying. The Howeitat Bedouin call this ritual "the true light of God".

The Bisha'a is usually performed only to resolve the gravest of civil or criminal offences, and is a voluntary ritual in the sense that consent on the part of the ritual undergoer is required. Typically, Bisha'a is only performed for those cases where there are no witnesses regarding the disputed issue. Societal peer and hierarchy pressures may, however, force consent. In the case of the defendant agreeing to a Bisha'a ceremony, and subsequently declining to perform the ritual or running away, the defendant is considered guilty.

The ritual is usually a public affair, with both parties arriving with fanfare. [[Tea]] is often served. Women are allowed to participate in the occasion, unlike other judiciary hearings of the Bedouins.

The instrument of the ritual - typically a metal ladle called the ''tassa bil basha'' is heated up by sticking the ladle down into the flames, the convex side being pressed into the ashes. Gasoline is often poured on the metal to heat it up. In the absence of a ladle, other metal objects like knives, spoons and rods are also used, and use of non-metals like rocks have also been documented. Both parties recount their side of the story during the process of heating, with the Mubesha interrupting for clarification. The Mubesha can also summarize the events. When the Mubesha decides that the ladle is sufficiently heated, both parties swear to God that the issue will end with the ritual, and the [[defendant]] undertakes the test. In some variants, the [[claimant]] can lick the spoon before the defendant in a bid to worry the defendant (This rare variant is practiced by the [[Armilat Bedouin]]). The Mubesha then counts [[worry beads]] (possibly [[prayer beads]]), and after a suitable lapse of time, inspects the tongue of the person undergoing the ritual. He decides whether or not the tongue is burnt (or the degree of the burn in some cases), and relates his decision to the assembly. The defendant then shows his tongue to the witnesses for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/BESHA.htm Of Bedouins and tasting fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118081532/http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/BESHA.htm |date=2006-11-18 }} by Larry W. Roeder, Jr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="besharoeder1"&gt;[http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/besha2.htm The fire of Besha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118081632/http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/besha2.htm |date=November 18, 2006 }} by Larry W. Roeder, Jr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mubesha==
The right to perform Bisha'a is granted only to the Mubesha, and this right is passed on from father to son, along paternal lineages. The Mubesha hears the account of the dispute before performing the ceremony, and is also responsible for pressing the metal spoon against the tongue of the person undergoing the Bisha'a. There are only a few practitioners of the Bisha'a in Bedouin society. A single Mubesha might arbitrate over several tribes and large geographical areas, like the Mubesha of [[Abu Sultan]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt;
In the Sinai Peninsula, Bisha's is widely used.

==Legend==
The legend behind the Bisha'a goes back to a man of great powers named ''Weymer abu Ayad'' of the ''Sultani'' branch of the [[Ayayideh]] tribe of the [[Qahtan]] confederation of Bedouins in southern Saudi Arabia. Many Mubesha claim to be able to trace their heritage to the tribe of Ayayideh. Weymer was a tracker but was robbed of a personal possession. He figured out the criminal, but there were no witnesses. Apparently, Weymer challenged the suspect to lick a red-hot [[branding iron]] three times which he would also lick three times, saying that the guilty would be shown. The suspect ran away.&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt;

==Legitimacy==
The Bisha'a was illegal under [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] rule, though numerous accounts of the performance of the ritual are documented in the records of the [[Foreign Office]] &lt;ref&gt;Records of the [[Foreign Office]] for Sinai and [[Egypt]], [[Public Record Office]], [[Kew Gardens]], [[London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bisha'a is illegal under the [[Israeli judicial system]]. It is also inconsistent with some interpretations of the [[Sharia]], rules of Islam, being an old ritual passed on by Bedouins from pre-[[Islam]]ic times. Most [[Arab state]]s thus denounce the Bisha'a. The practice is getting rarer, with more and more Bedouins preferring standard courts of law for enactment of justice.

==Documentation==
The Bisha'a has been variously described in ethnographic and cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/law.htm The Sinai Bedouin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127041404/http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/law.htm |date=2007-01-27 }}, by Larry W.

W. Murray.&lt;ref&gt;Sons of Ishmael: A Study of the Egyptian Bedouin, by G.W. Murray, London: Routledge, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; Later accounts of
[[Glubb Pasha]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanjubilee.com/meetfolk/glubb.htm A short history of the Arab peoples]; by John B. Glubb; Hodder and Stoughton, London 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aref al-Aref]]&lt;ref&gt;Bedouin Love, Law, and Legend: Dealing Exclusively with the Badu of Beersheba (transl. from the Arab original); A. al-Aref, and H. W. Tilley (trans.); Jerusalem, Cosmos Publ. House / New York: AMS Press; 1944 / 1974&lt;/ref&gt; also refer to the practice. Glubb Pasha's account mentions the high rate of correct judgement, which he attributes to the skill of the ''mubesha''. A quote from his account:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In practice, more than half the accused persons who set out to lick the spoon lose their nerve while the spoon is in the fire, and voluntarily confess to their guilt without blistering their tongues. A further twenty-five per cent probably blister their tongues, and twenty-five per cent are declared innocent. The efficiency of the process depends, of course, entirely on the skill of the “mubesha.” The days of the “true light of God” are doubtless numbered, and in the full glare of modern democracy and (doubtless) enlightenment, the little red-hot spoon will soon vanish. Before it does so, I cannot resist paying a tribute to the skill of those who practise this infamous superstition, and to the considerable number of miscarriages of justice which were by this means avoided.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The quasiscientific explanation of the ordeal is that [[stress (medicine)|stress]] would cause the mouth of liar to dry up, hence increasing the possibility of a burn.&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt; However, the stress of the ordeal could just as easily cause the same physical symptoms in an innocent person.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==In popular culture==

Recent interest in the Bisha'a stems from two contemporary [[Israel]]i films which portray the Bisha'a - [[Yellow Asphalt]] (2001) and [[Bisha: The Awesome Fire Test]] (2002).

'''Camp''' is an [[aesthetic]] style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[irony|ironic]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Babuscio (1993, 20), Feil (2005, 478), Morrill (1994, 110), Shugart and Waggoner (2008, 33), and Van Leer (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Camp aesthetics disrupt many of [[modernism]]'s notions of what art is and what can be classified as [[high art]] by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005"&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick (2005) "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' Vol.35 №1 pp. 1–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick.

''Canadian Review of American Studies'' (2005) 35:1 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. "Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence." Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005" /&gt;

Camp art is related to—and often confused with—[[kitsch]], and things with camp appeal may also be described as "cheesy". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted "ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical", or "[[effeminate]]" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised "banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, 1976 edition, sense 6, [Slang, orig., homosexual jargon, Americanism] banality, mediocrity, artifice, ostentation, etc. so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s essay "[[Notes on 'Camp']]" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' ''excess''. Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.

Camp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers [[George Kuchar|George]] and [[Mike Kuchar]], [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and his film ''[[Flaming Creatures]]'', and later [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], including the last's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', and ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]''. Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include [[drag queen]]s and performers such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[RuPaul]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Liberace]]. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of [[popular culture]] in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' have been described as camp.

== Origins and development ==
In 1909, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gave the first print citation of ''camp'' as
{{quote|ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals. So as a noun, 'camp' behaviour, mannerisms, et cetera. (cf. quot. 1909); a man exhibiting such behaviour.}}

[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Carmen Miranda]] in the trailer for ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1943)]]

According to the dictionary, this sense is "etymologically obscure". ''Camp'' in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term ''se camper'', meaning "to pose in an exaggerated fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=camp (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camp|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm Entry "camper"], in: ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'', ninth edition (1992). "'''2.''' Fam: Placer avec fermeté, avec insolence ou selon ses aises.] ''Il me parlait, le chapeau campé sur la tête.'' Surtout pron. ''Se camper solidement dans son fauteuil. Se camper à la meilleure place. Il se campa devant son adversaire.'' '''3.''' En parlant d'un acteur, d'un artiste: Figurer avec force et relief. ''Camper son personnage sur la scène. Camper une figure dans un tableau, des caractères dans un roman''." ('''Familiar:''' To assume a defiant, insolent or [[wiktionary:devil-may-care|devil-may-care]] attitude. '''Theatre:''' To perform with forcefulness and exaggeration; [[wiktionary:overact|to overact]].{{indent|12}}To impose one's character assertively into a scene; [[wiktionary:upstage|to upstage]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Esther Newton (1978): ''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America'', University Of Chicago Press. {{worldcat|name=''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America''|oclc=257048012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was made mainstream, and [[adjective|adjectivized]], by [[Susan Sontag]] in a landmark essay (see below).

The rise of post-modernism made ''camp'' a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=newton /&gt; Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: [[Swish (slang)|swish]] and [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators ([[faux queen]]s), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of [[Carmen Miranda]]. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines ''camp'' as "queer parody".&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2010): ''An Archaeology of Posing: Essays on Camp, Drag, and Sexuality'', Macater Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9814924-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2011): ''The Politics and Poetics of Camp'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-51489-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary culture ==
=== Television ===
Much of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to [[colour television]] in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook [[superhero]] (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as ''Batman'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. 

Ironically, even ''Batman'' fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of ''[[Captain Nice]]'' and ''[[Mister Terrific (TV series)|Mr. Terrific]]'', which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of ''Batman'' may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s essay ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' which led to the comics' industry-sponsored [[Comics Code]]), as the ''Batman'' comic books were very dark and [[Film noir|noirish]] until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.

Television series such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1961–1969), ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1964–1966), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964–1967), ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965–1968), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965–1969), ''[[Get Smart (TV series)|Get Smart]]'' (1965–1970), ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' (1972–1985), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976–1981), ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' (1977–1984) and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their "camp" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.

In a ''[[Monty Python]]'' sketch of their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|television show]] (Episode 22, "Camp Square-Bashing", repeated in their film ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military "Swanning About" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers "camp it up" in unison.

TV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978–1991)  and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'' (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on [[Brian Sewell]]) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to [[Lolo Ferrari]] was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of [[OFCOM]] if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. [[Mentos]] television commercials during the 1990s developed a [[cult following]] due to their camp "[[Eurotrash (term)|Eurotrash]]" humour. In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|Season 8]] episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]" (1997) of the American [[animated comedy]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', gay secondary character John (played by gay director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]) defines to [[Homer Simpson]] the meaning of the word ''camp'' to be "tragically ludicrous", or "ludicrously tragic": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of ''camp'' as "when a clown dies".

The [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' (1999–2000), starring comedian [[Amy Sedaris]], was a camp spoof of the ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-PAURpOlB8C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=%22strangers+with+candy+which+was%22+camp&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGsYeZ8sHVAhVl_IMKHVcbAyAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22strangers%20with%20candy%20which%20was%22%20camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/2006/07/06/strangers-with-candy-after-school-special-sedaris-style/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESPN Classic]] show ''[[Cheap Seats without Ron Parker]]'' (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'' during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine [[ballet]] with skiing ([[ski ballet]]), the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious [[Attica State Prison]] in upstate New York, small-time regional [[professional wrestling]] and [[roller derby]]. The television series ''[[Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from [[Public-access television]] productions, early morning [[infomercial]]s, and the use of celebrity status in [[telethon]]s and other televised charity appeals.

=== Film ===
[[File:Coca Sarli 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine [[pop icon]] and [[sex symbol]] [[Isabel Sarli]], whose [[sexploitation film]]s made alongside [[Armando Bó]] are celebrated for their camp tone.]]
Some classic films noted for their camp tone include:
* [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953, starring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), an exaggerated ''film noir'' send-up.
* Filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] directed a number of camp films such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Female Trouble]]'' (1974), ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) and ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' (2004).
* Filmmaker [[Todd Solondz]] uses camp music to illustrate the absurdity and banality of bourgeois, suburban existence. In Solondz's [[cult film]] ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' (1995), the eleven-year-old girl protagonist kisses a boy while [[Deborah Gibson]]'s "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]" plays on a [[Fisher-Price]] tape recorder.

Films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like [[Patty Duke]] in ''Valley of the Dolls'' and [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''Mommie Dearest'', gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.

The second part of the 1978 movie ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] tone after the seriousness of the origin story.

Educational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' could be seen as [[kitsch]], even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of [[national security]] and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British [[Public Information Film]]s gained a camp cult following, such as the famous [[Charley Says]] series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ [[Kenny Everett]], who came from an [[advertising]] background as a [[copywriter]].

Some films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s black comedy crime film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic [[Nicholas Christopher]] calling it "more gangland Camp than neo-noir". In [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'' series]] (1958–1978). Another cult is built around ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975). ''[[Preaching to the Perverted (film)|Preaching to the Perverted]]'' (1997), written and directed by [[Stuart Urban]], broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and [[BDSM]] scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.

Movie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of [[George Kuchar]] and his brother [[Mike Kuchar]], [[ASS Studios]], launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and [[Jen Miller]], began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film ''[[Satan, Hold My Hand]]'' (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.&lt;ref&gt;filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-hi...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=COURTNEY FATHOM SELL: SO YOU WANNA BE AN UNDERGROUND FILMMAKER?|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion ===
[[File:Clarkes on Belmont.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The banner of a diner featuring a 1950s-era camp advertisement]]

Retro-camp fashion is an example of modern [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The classic camp yard ornament is the pink [[plastic flamingo]]. The [[yard globe]], [[garden gnome]], wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a [[lawn jockey]]) and ceramic statues of [[white-tailed deer]] are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.

The [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel]] chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as [[Cookie Puss]] and [[Fudgie The Whale]].

== Distinguishing between kitsch and camp ==
The words "camp" and "[[kitsch]]" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, "kitsch" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas "camp" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture "in quotation marks."&lt;ref name="Sontag2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sontag|title=Against Interpretation and Other Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLdQPwAACAAJ|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=978-0-14-119006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between "naive" and "deliberate" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category "naive camp" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; "deliberate camp", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)

== Around the world ==
[[File:Mika Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pop singer [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] is known for his camp-styled performances]]

Thomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of [[Femininity|feminine]] gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian [[Kenneth Williams]] wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: "Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Davies]] (1993) ''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'', Harper-Collins Publishers {{ISBN|978-0-00-255023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character [[Daffyd Thomas]] in the English comedy skit show ''[[Little Britain]]''. "Camp" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like [[Kylie Minogue]], [[John Inman]], [[Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], [[Lesley Joseph]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Dale Winton]], [[Cilla Black]], and the [[music hall]] tradition of the [[pantomime]] are camp elements in popular culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The British tradition of the "[[Last Night of the Proms]]" has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche.&lt;ref&gt;Compare:

The Australian theatre and opera director [[Barrie Kosky]] is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the [[Western canon]] including [[Shakespeare]], [[Wagner]], [[Molière]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Kafka]] and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company ''The Lost Echo'', based on [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' and [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In the first act ("The Song of Phaeton"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the musical arrangements feature [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]]. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban [[middle class]], which is suggestive of the style of [[Dame Edna Everage]]. For example, in ''The Lost Echo'' Kosky employs a chorus of [[Secondary school|high school]] girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, "Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on ''[[Australian Idol]]''." See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular "Strictly Ballroom".

Since 2000, the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many [[Eurovision]] performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called "the Eurovision kitsch drive", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.

== Literature ==
The first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s 1954 novel ''The World in the Evening'', where he comments: "You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun ''out'' of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance."  In the American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s 1964 essay "[[Notes on "Camp"|Notes on 'Camp']]", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included [[Tiffany lamp]]s, the drawings of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], Tchaikovsky's ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and Japanese science fiction films such as [[Rodan (film)|''Rodan'']], and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' of the 1950s.

In Mark Booth's 1983 book ''Camp'' he defines camp as "to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits." He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and ''camp fads and fancies'', things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.

==Analysis==
As a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with [[multiculturalism]] and the [[New Left]]. The best known instance of this is the [[gay liberation]] movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity.  The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, ''[[The Man from C.A.M.P.]]'' in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as [[Mae West]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Joan Crawford]] also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.

As a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility.  Mainstream [[comic books]] and B [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many [[avant-garde|Vanguardist]] movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.

According to the sociologist [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a "throwaway Pop aesthetic", camp works to intermingle the categories of "high" and "low" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, "tends to refer to a subjective process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, "unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, "afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.

Camp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, "is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the "yuck factor". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, "it's good because it's awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From flea markets to thrift stores, the 'bad taste' of camp has been increasingly reinculcated with the cultural capital that it had intended to break away from. In an attempt to "present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as [[Macklemore]] with his hit single "[[Thrift Shop]]".&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, "it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation."&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9568">[[File:Chemotaxis, Capillary Tube Assay.svg|thumb|The process of chemotaxis can be demonstrated using a capillary tube assay(shown above). The motile prokaryotes can sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. When no chemicals are present, movement is completely random. When a repellent or attractant chemical is present, the motility changes; runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent so that the net movement towards or away from the chemical can be achieved. The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the attractant, and away from the repellent.

'''Chemotaxis assays''' are experimental tools for evaluation of [[chemotactic]] ability of [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] cells.
A wide variety of techniques have been developed. Some techniques are [[qualitative property|qualitative]] - allowing an investigator to approximately determine a cell's chemotacic affinity for an analyte - while others are [[quantitative property|quantitative]], allowing a precise measurement of this affinity.

== Quality control ==
In general, the most important requisite is to calibrate the [[incubation time]] of the assay both to the model cell and the ligand to be evaluated. Too short incubation time results no cells in the sample, while too long time perturbs the concentration gradients and measures more [[chemokinesis|chemokinetic]] than [[chemotactic]] responses.

The most commonly used techniques are grouped into two main groups:

== Agar-plate techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-asay-agar.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis assays with agar plates]]
This way of evaluation deals with [[agar-agar]] or [[gelatine]] containing semi-solid layers made prior to the experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut at the start of the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai L. | title= Method for determination of chemoattraction in Tetrahymena pyriformis.| journal= Curr Microbiol | year= 1995| volume= 30| pages= 251–3 | doi= 10.1007/BF00293642 | pmid= 7765899 | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells could be counted from the front of migrating cells, after staining or in native conditions in light microscope.

== Two-chamber techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-twochamber-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis chamber assays]]

=== Boyden chamber ===
Chambers isolated by filters are proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Boyden, S.V. | title= The chemotactic effect of mixtures of antibody and antigen on polymorphonuclear leucocytes. | journal= J Exp Med | year= 1962| volume= 115 | issue= 3| pages=453–66 | doi= 10.1084/jem.115.3.453 | pmid= 13872176 | pmc= 2137509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motile cells are placed into the upper chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; it is essential to choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling ''in vivo'' conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of [[extracellular matrix]] ([[collagen]], [[elastin]] etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.

=== Bridge chambers ===
In another setting the chambers are connected side by side horizontally (Zigmond chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Zigmond S.H.
| title=Ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to orient in gradients of chemotactic factors
| journal=Journal of Cell Biology
| year=1977
| volume=75
| issue=2
| pages=606–616
| doi=10.1083/jcb.75.2.606
| citeseerx=10.1.1.336.4181
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as concentric rings on a slide (Dunn chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zicha D. |author2=Dunn G.A. |author3=Brown A.F. | title= A new direct-viewing chemotaxis chamber.| journal= J Cell Sci | year=  1991 | volume= 99| pages=769–75|pmid= 1770004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentration gradient develops on a narrow connecting bridge between the chambers and the number of migrating cells is also counted on the surface of the bridge by light microscope. In some cases the bridge between the two chambers is filled with agar and cells have to "[[Bacterial gliding|glide]]" in this semisolid layer.

=== Capillary techniques ===
Some capillary techniques provide also a chamber like arrangement, however, there is no filter between the cells and the test substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leick V. |author2=Helle J. | title= A quantitative assay for ciliate chemotaxis.| journal= Anal Biochem | year= 1983| volume= 135| pages=466–9 | doi= 10.1016/0003-2697(83)90713-3 | pmid= 6660520 | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative results are gained by the multiwell type of this probe using 4-8-12-channel pipettes. Accuracy of the pipette and increased number of the parallel running samples is the great advantage of this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai, L., Lemberkovits, É. and Csaba, G.| title= Molecule dependent chemotactic responses of Tetrahymena pyriformis elicited by volatile oils.| journal= Acta Protozool | year= 1995| volume= 34| pages= 181–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells are count from the lower chamber (long incubation time) or from the filter (short incubation time). For detection of cells general staining techniques (e.g. [[trypan blue]]) or special probes (e.g. mt-dehydrogenase detection with MTT assay) are used. Labelled (e.g. [[fluorochrome]]s) cells are also used, in some assays cells get labelled during transmigration the filter.

== Other techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-other-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Other chemotaxis assay techniques]]
Besides the above-mentioned two, most commonly used family of techniques a wide range of protocols were developed to measure chemotactic activity. Some of them are only qualitative, like aggregation tests, where small pieces of agar or filters are placed onto a slide and accumulation of cells around is measured.

In another semiquantitative technique cells are overlaid the test substance and changes in [[opalescence]] of the originally cell-free compartment is recorded during the incubation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koppelhus U. |author2=Hellung-Larsen P. |author3=Leick V. | title= An improved quantitative assay for chemokinesis in Tetrahymena.| journal= Biol Bull| year= 1994 | volume= 187| pages= 8–15 | doi= 10.2307/1542160 | pmid= 7918798 | issue= 1 | publisher= Marine Biological Laboratory | jstor= 1542160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third very frequently used, however, qualitative technique is the T-[[maze]] and its adaptations for microplates. In the original version a container drilled in a peg is filled with cells. Then the peg is twisted and the cells get contact with two other containers filled with different substances. The incubation is stopped with resetting the peg, the cell number is counted from the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Houten J. |author2=Martel E. |author3=Kasch T. | title= Kinetic analysis of chemokinesis of Paramecium.| journal= J Protozool | year= 1982| volume= 29| pages= 226–30| pmid=7097615 | issue= 2 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1982.tb04016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, lately,{{When|date=January 2018}} microfluidic devices have been more and more frequently used to test quantitatively, and precisely, for chemotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seymour J.

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism''' is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something. 
[[File:Julio Ruelas - Criticism - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Crítica'', engraving by [[Julio Ruelas]], ca. 1907]] 
*The judger is called a ''[[critic]]''. 
*To engage in criticism is to ''criticise'' (in British English – see [[American and British English spelling differences#aise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|American and British English spelling differences]].) 
*One specific item of criticism is called a ''criticism'' or ''[[critique]]''.

Criticism is an evaluative or corrective exercise that can occur in any area of human life. Criticism can therefore take many different forms (see below). How people go about criticizing, can vary a great deal. In specific areas of human endeavour, the form of criticism can be highly specialized and technical; it often requires professional knowledge to appreciate the criticism. For subject-specific information, see the [[Varieties of criticism]] page.

To criticize does not necessarily imply "to find fault", but the word is often taken to mean the simple expression of an object against [[prejudice]], no matter positive or negative. Often criticism involves active disagreement, but it may only mean "taking sides". Constructive criticism will often involve an exploration of the different sides of an issue. 

Criticism is often presented as something unpleasant, but there are friendly criticisms, amicably discussed, and some people find great pleasure in criticism ("keeping people sharp", "providing the critical edge"). The [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.

When criticism involves a [[dialogue]] of some kind, direct or indirect, it is an intrinsically social activity. &lt;!--Even if one is only criticizing a book or an idea in private, it is usually assumed there is someone who will be made aware of the criticism being expressed at some point, although who exactly will hear it, may also remain unknown. One is still engaging with the ideas of others, even if only indirectly. One can also keep a criticism to oneself, rather than express or communicate it, but in general the intention is, that someone else ought to be aware of it, however that may occur. Self-criticism, even if wholly private, still mentally takes the concerns of others into account.  &lt;&lt;   ??  --&gt;

Criticism is also the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature, artwork, film, and social trends (see the article links below). The goal is to understand the possible meanings of cultural phenomena, and the context in which they take shape. In so doing, it is often evaluated how cultural productions relate to other cultural productions, and what their place is within a particular genre, or a particular cultural tradition.

==Etymology==
This section is about the origin and evolution of the meanings of the expression "criticism".

===Early English meaning===
*The English word criticism is derived from the French ''critique'', which dates back to at least the 14th century. 
*The words "critic" and "critical" existed in the English language from the mid-16th century, and the word "criticism" first made its appearance in English in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Williams]], ''Keywords: a vocabulary of culture and society.'' Fontana, 1976, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In turn, the French expression ''critique'' has roots in Latin ("''criticus''" – a judger, decider, or critic), and, even earlier, classical Greek language ("''krites''" means judge, and "''kritikos''" means able to make judgements, or the critic). Related Greek terms are ''krinein'' (separating out, deciding), ''krei-'' (to sieve, discriminate, or distinguish) and ''krisis'' (literally, the judgement, the result of a trial, or a selection resulting from a choice or decision). ''[[Crito]]'' is also the name of a pupil and friend of the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]], as well as the name of an imaginary dialogue about justice written by the philosopher [[Plato]] in the context of the execution of Socrates.

The early English meaning of criticism was primarily [[literary criticism]], that of judging and interpreting literature.  [[Samuel Johnson]] is often held as the prime example of criticism in the English language, and his contemporary [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Essay on Criticism'' is a significant landmark.  In the course of the 17th century, it acquired the more general sense of [[censure]], as well as the more specialized meaning of the "discernment of taste", i.e. the art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic works, implicitly from the point of view of a consumer.

To be critical meant, positively, to have good, informed judgement about matters of culture (to be cultivated, to be a man or woman of distinction), but negatively it could also refer to the (unreasonable) rejection or (unfair) treatment of some outside group ("to be critical of them"). Derivatively, "a criticism" also referred to a nice point or a distinction, a tiny detail, a pedantic nicety, a subtlety, or a quibble (the sense of what today is called a "minor criticism"). Often criticism was governed by very strict cultural rules of politeness, propriety and decency, and there could be immediate penalties if the wrong words were said or written down (in 17th century England, more than half of men and about three-quarters of women could not read or write).

In the 19th century, criticism also gained the philosophical meaning of "a critical examination of the faculty of knowledge", particularly in the sense used by [[Immanuel Kant]]. (See [[Oxford English Dictionary]]). Such criticism was carried out mainly by academic authorities, businessmen and men of property with the leisure to devote themselves to the pursuit of knowledge.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, all these meanings continued, but criticism acquired the more general connotation of voicing an objection, or of appraising the pros and cons of something.

*The shape and meanings of criticism were influenced considerably by wars (including two world wars) occurring almost continuously somewhere in the world. 
*With the growth of specializations in the [[division of labour]], and the growth of [[tertiary education]], innumerable different branches of criticism emerged with their own rules and specialized technical meanings. 
*Philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos]] have popularized the idea that criticism is a ''normal'' part of scientific activity. Relatedly, "scientific criticism" has become a standard expression, just as much as "literary criticism". 
*Gradually it was accepted that criticism is a ''normal'' process in a democratic society, rather than a sign of inadequacy, or something that should be strictly controlled or repressed.

From the 1970s onward, under the influence of [[neo-Marxism]], [[critical theory]] and [[Michel Foucault]], it became fashionable in the English-speaking academic social sciences and humanities to use the French word "''[[critique]]''", instead of the ordinary "criticism". The suggestion is that there is a ''difference'' between the two terms, but what exactly it is, is often not altogether clear. Often the connotation is that if a deliberation is a "critique" and not just a "criticism", then there is "a lot of extra thought and profound meaning" behind what is being said. A "critique" in the modern sense is normally understood as a ''systematic'' criticism, a critical essay, or the critical appraisal of a [[discourse]] (or parts of a discourse). Thus, many academic papers came to be titled or subtitled "a critique". From the 1970s, English-speaking academics and journalists also began to use the word "critique" not only as a [[noun]], but as a [[verb]] (e.g. "I have critiqued the idea", instead of "I have criticized the idea"). What is often implied is, that "critiqueing" goes deeper into the issue, or is more complete, than "criticizing", possibly because the specialist criteria of a particular discipline are being applied.

===21st century===
*From the 1990s, the popular meanings of the word criticism have started to evolve more strongly toward "having an objection", "expressing dissent", "stating a dislike", "wanting to dissociate from something", or "rejecting something" ("If you liked it, you would not be criticizing it"). In the contemporary sense, criticism is often more the expression of an attitude, where the object of criticism may only be vaguely defined. For example, somebody "unlikes" something on [[Facebook]] or "unfriends" somebody.
*In general, there is less money in literary criticism, while it has become easier for anyone to publish anything at a very low cost on the Internet – without necessarily being vetted through critically by others.
*Professionally, "what it means to criticize" has become a much more ''specialized'' and ''technical'' matter, where "inside knowledge" is required to understand the criticism truly; this development is linked to the circumstance, that the ''right'' to criticize, or the ''propriety'' (appropriate use) of criticism, is regarded nowadays much more as depending on one's ''position'', or on the context of the situation ("I would like to say something, but I am not in a position to criticize"). 
*Because many more people are able to travel to, or have contact with, worlds completely different from their own, new problems are created of how to ''relativize'' criticisms and their limitations, how to put everything into meaningful proportion. This affects what a criticism is understood to be, or to mean, and what its overall significance is thought to be.
*Digital information technology and telecommunications have begun to change drastically the ways people have for getting attention, or for being taken seriously. In turn, this has begun to change the ways people have for ''going about'' criticizing, and what criticism ''means'' for people. 
*With more possibilities for sophisticated expression, criticism has tended to become more "layered". Beneath the observable surface presentation of criticism, which is freely advertised, there are often additional layers of deeper criticism. These are not directly accessible, because they require additional information, or insight into additional meanings. To gain access to the "whole story" about a criticism, and not just "part of the story", may be conditional on fulfilling certain entry requirements ("if you don't have the ticket, you don't get the knowledge"). 
*Together with the ability to make finer distinctions of meaning with the aid of digital equipment, the possibilities for [[ambiguity]] in criticism have increased: is a criticism being implied, or is it not, and if so, what exactly is the criticism? It can take more effort to unravel the full story.

==Classifications==
Criticism can be:
*directed toward a person or an animal; at a group, authority or organization; at a specific behaviour; or at an object of some kind (an idea, a relationship, a condition, a process, or a thing). 
*personal (delivered directly from one person to another, in a personal capacity), or impersonal (expressing the view of an organization, and not aimed at anyone personally). 
*highly specific and detailed, or very abstract and general.
*verbal (expressed in language) or non-verbal (expressed symbolically, or expressed through an action or a way of behaving).
*explicit (the criticism is clearly stated) or implicit (a criticism is implied by what is being said, but it is not stated openly).
*the result of [[critical thinking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/critical/ |title=Module: Critical thinking |publisher=Philosophy.hku.hk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spontaneous impulse.

Different kinds of criticisms can be distinguished as types using the following criteria:
*'''Point of view''' from which the criticism is made ("in what framework", "from what angle or perspective" is the criticism made).
*'''Content''' of criticism, what it consists of ("what" is the criticism).
*'''Purpose''', motive, use or function of criticism ("why" is the criticism being raised, what is its aim).
*'''Form''' of criticism, language used or medium of expression (in what "style" or format is the criticism presented). 
*'''Method of delivery''', transmission or communication for the criticism ("how", or by what means, is the criticism conveyed).
*'''Type of critic''' or the source making the criticism ("from whom" criticism originates). 
*'''Target''' or object of the criticism (criticism "of whom" or criticism "of what").
*'''Context''', place, setting or situation for the criticism ("where" is the criticism being made).
*'''Recipients''' or audience of the criticism, intended or unintended (criticism directed or addressed "to where" or "to whom"). 

In dealing with criticisms, usually the most important aspects are who makes the criticism, what the criticism is about, and what or whom it is aimed at. It can also make a big difference though whether a criticism is e.g. communicated in person, or whether it is communicated with a letter or telephone message.

For subject-specific information, see the critical pages on [[Art criticism|art]], [[Film criticism|film]], [[Literary criticism|literature]], [[Theatre criticism|theatre]], or [[Architecture criticism|architecture]].

==Psychology==
In general, the psychology of criticism studies the cognitive and emotional effects of criticism, the behavioral characteristics of criticism, and its influence on how people are reacting.

===Area of study===
The psychology of criticism is primarily concerned with: 
*the '''motivation''', purpose or intent which people have for making criticisms – healthy or unhealthy.
*the '''meaning''' of criticism for the self, and for others – positive or negative.
*the '''effect''' which criticism has on other people – good or bad.
*how people '''respond''' to criticisms, or cope with them – negatively or positively.
*the '''quantity and quality''' of criticism required to achieve the desired effect or outcome.
*the '''form''' in which criticisms are delivered – effective or ineffective.
*how people '''learn''' to give and receive criticism successfully.
*the '''[[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]''', '''[[Psychological repression|repression]]''' or '''[[denial]]''' of criticism.

Parents, teachers, lawyers, managers and politicians are often concerned with these issues, because it can make a great deal of difference to how problems are tackled and resolved.

The motivation as well as the effect of criticism may be rational, or it may be non-rational or arbitrary; it may be healthy or unhealthy.

When psychologists study criticism as a type of human behavior, they do not usually study it "in general" – such a general study is often considered to be more a ''philosophical'' concern. Psychologists usually study it in specific contexts and situations. The reason is partly technical (it is difficult to construct and prove universal generalizations about criticism as a human behavior) and partly practical (it is more useful to understand particular behaviors which are of direct practical concern).

===The most basic rule===

The most basic "rule-of-thumb" of criticism which psychologists usually recommend is:

:"'''Respect the individual, focus the criticism on the ''behavior'' that needs changing – on what people ''actually do'' or ''actually say''.'''"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Rationale====
The thought behind this basic norm for criticism is: 
*If individuals are attacked for their personal characteristics (for "being who they are") it may be impossible for them to change, therefore making the criticism useless. 
*If it is not actually clear what the person ''does'', or what they are ''really saying'', the criticism may miss the mark. By concentrating clearly and only on observation of what the individual as a matter of fact ''does'' or ''says'', it is less likely, that the criticism will be misplaced, confused or misinterpreted; it is less likely, that the person being criticized is being misunderstood. It would be unfair and unjust, not to say irrelevant, to criticize people for something they have not actually done. It would be a false accusation.
*Inversely, if the individuals are respected with a bit of humor, and due credit is given to their positive intentions as human beings, it is vastly more likely that the criticism will be understood, and taken seriously. And if the criticism is clearly directed only to "what people actually do" that is wrong, instead of "who they are", it creates possibilities, options and choices for doing something different and better. They can't change who they are, but they can change their actions. Because people's sense of dignity is secure in this case, they are better able to respond to the criticism, and indeed do something about it.

The critics may just want to provoke or vent a bit of hostility, but it might backfire, because the people criticized may make a nasty response. The nasty response may "prove" to the critics, that the criticism was justified, but the critics have brought this on themselves, they have produced their own nastiness. It is easy to do, but may be difficult to live with. In the process, the whole point of the criticism may be lost – all that happens is, that there is a quarrel between people who just vent their hostility. This is very unlikely to produce any solution that all concerned can live with.

The basic psychological rule of criticism assumes that people want to use criticism to achieve an '''improvement''', usually "in good faith" ([[bona fide]]). It assumes the critic has a positive intention in making the criticism. The rule may not make much sense if there is an all-out war going on, where the opposition is just trying to destroy and discredit the target as much as possible, using almost any means they can find. Nevertheless, psychologists recommend to respond by attacking what the opponents actually ''do'', not ''who they are''. That way, the critic cannot be accused of unfair or prejudiced treatment of others.

====Application====
The basic rule is not always easy to apply.

*It may be difficult to have respect for somebody who is the target of criticism, especially if there is a history of grievances. 
*It may be that it ''seems'' as though people are being respected, but in reality (if you understand the full meaning) they are being ''disrespected''. It might look formally like they are treated as equals, but in reality (informally speaking, practically and substantively) they are being denigrated. 
*It may be difficult to consider the action which is being criticized, in its own right, ''separately'' from the person ("only you could do something awful like this to me").

Consequently, psychologists often recommend that before a criticism is being stated to a person, the critic should try to get into [[rapport]] with the person being criticized ("get in sync" with the other person, "on the same wavelength"). If that is not possible (because they are enemies), the best thing may be not to express the criticism at all, or get a mediator. It may take considerable strategy in order to find a way of making a criticism, so that it "really hits home". Rather than "shooting their mouth off", it may be wise if people say nothing, until the right time and place arrives to make the criticism.

One problem at the ''receiving'' end is that a criticism may be taken more seriously than it really merits, or that it is taken "too personally", even though that was not the intention of the critic. Criticisms are often voiced without knowing exactly what the response will be. It may be that this problem cannot be entirely removed; the best one can do is to judge, on the basis of experience, what would be the most likely effect of the criticism, and communicate the criticism as well as one can.

Another sort of problem is the limited [[attention span]] of individuals. To express a criticism may require detailed explanation or clarification; it presupposes that the knowledge exists to understand what it is about, and that people are willing to listen. That takes time, and the time may not be available, or people are reluctant to take the time. This can get in the way of the mutual respect required. It may be possible to overcome this problem only by formulating the criticism as briefly as possible, and communicate it in a form which takes the least time to understand it. Failing that, people must "make time" to discuss the criticism. It can take considerable effort to create the situation in which the criticism will be "heard".

====Exception to the rule====
The '''exception''' to the basic psychological rule consists of cases where, it is argued, the individuals and their behaviors ''cannot be distinguished''. This would be the case, for example, if the criticism itself consisted of "being there" (intruding, trespassing, causing property damage), or "not being there" (non-response).

In some cases people deliberately seek "loopholes" in the ordinary rules and channels for criticism, in order to make a criticism which, although strictly not illegal, may have a malicious intention, or offends the target of the criticism. That can cause the ordinary consideration which people have for others to be abandoned. What is legitimate and illegitimate criticism is not always easy to establish, and there may be "grey areas" in the law. It is rarely possible to make rules for every detail of what people may or may not do. The law itself can also be contested with criticism, if it is perceived as unfair. Nevertheless, the courts usually draw the line somewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Andale Gross and Tammy Webber, "Prosecutor faces new criticism over Ferguson case." ''The Seattle Times'', 26 November 2014.[http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2025102712_apxfergusonprosecutorscrutiny.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning to criticize===
The ability to criticize is something which rarely occurs naturally; it must be learnt. Good critics exhibit several kinds of qualities:
*'''Insight''': critics should clearly understand ''why'' they are criticizing.
*'''Attitude''': critics should be emotionally confident and morally comfortable, both about making a criticism, and about dealing with the response to criticism. 
*'''Inquiry''': critics should be willing to question authority, popular opinion, and assumptions.
*'''Knowledge''': critics should research the subject of their criticism to maintain the factual integrity of their criticism.
*'''Skills''': critics should choose and apply the correct kind of criticism to an issue, so that the criticism will be balanced, complete and persuasive. Critics require adequate skills in reasoning, research, and communication.
*'''Integrity''': critics should remain consistent and honest before, during, and after a criticism is expressed.

These qualities are learned through practical experience in which people have a dialogue or debate and give each other feedback. Often, teachers can design assignments specifically to stimulate students to acquire these qualities. But the facility for critical thought usually requires some personal initiative. There are plenty of "lazy critics", but one must work hard to be a good critic. The lazy critic is soon forgotten, but a good critic is remembered for years.

===Balance===

With criticism it is always important to keep things in proportion, neither overdoing things, nor being too timid.

*People can be too critical, but they can also be insufficiently critical. It is important to strike a good balance: to be neither excessively critical nor completely uncritical.
*People who are ''too critical'' and focus only on the downside or limitation of things run into the problem that others perceive them as being "too negative", and lacking a "constructive attitude". If there is too much criticism, it gets in the way of getting anything done – people are just "anti", but "it does not lead anywhere".
*People who are ''uncritical'', however, are often regarded as naive and superficial ("suckers"); they lack discernment, they are prone to being deceived and tricked, because they readily believe all kinds of things, which they should not accept just like that, for their own good. If they thought more critically, they would not give in so easily to what others say or do. The idea here is that "one should not be so open-minded that one's brains fall out."

An important reason why balanced criticism is desirable is, that if things get totally out of proportion, the critics or their targets can lose their balance themselves. Criticism can wreak havoc, and therefore people have to know how to handle it from both ends. If the criticism is balanced, it is more likely to be successful, or, at any rate, it has more credibility.

===Effect on others===
When psychologists analyze the effect of criticism on others, they are concerned with how people respond to criticism (cognitively and emotionally), and how criticism influences the recipient's behavior.

====Positive and negative effects====
When people criticize, it can have a fruitful, enriching and constructive effect on the recipient, because new ideas and viewpoints may be generated in trying to solve a problem.

People can also be hurt by criticisms, when they experience the criticism as a personal attack. Psychologists concerned with human communication, such as therapists, therefore often recommend that people should choose the right words to express their criticism.  The same criticism can be raised in different ways, some more successful than others.

====Formulation====
If people formulate their criticism in the right way, it is more likely that other people will accept it. If the criticism is badly expressed, people might reject it, not because it is wrong in itself, but because they do not like being talked to in that way. Even if the content of a criticism is quite valid, the form in which it is expressed may be so [[wikt: counterproductive|counter-productive]], that the criticism is not accepted. The ''content'' may be something that people can work out on their own, but the ''form'' concerns the social relationship between people.

====Feedback fallacy====
{{main|Feedback#Social_sciences}}
 
The term "[[feedback]]" is often used instead of criticism, because "feedback" may sound more neutral, while criticism may seem to be about "finding fault". A more polite language may be used when there are issues of [[authority]] and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] ("who has to follow whom"), as well as the need for cooperative teamwork to get a job done ("constructive collegial attitude"). The question is often "who controls the feedback", "who is allowed to criticize", "who owns the problem" and "who is to do something about the problem". It may be that managers educate employees to employ a more positive and professional language, in order to get them to see things in a way that is [[Feedback#Social sciences|more productive]] for the enterprise.

===Quality===

Especially educators, but also e.g. lawyers, managers and politicians are very concerned with the ''quality'' of criticisms. People might raise all kinds of objections and criticisms, but how good are they? Criticisms can be just "noise". They can also be a nuisance if they are misdirected, they get in the way of getting things done.

====Good====
Ideally, a criticism should be:
*'''timely''', not too early nor too late.
*'''brief and succinct''', with a clear start and a finish, not endless.
*'''relevant and to the point''', not misplaced.
*'''clear, specific and precise''', not vague.
*'''well-researched''', not based on hear-say or speculative thought.
*'''sincere and positively intended''', not malicious.
*'''articulate, persuasive and ''[[Action item|actionable]]''''', so that the recipient can both understand the criticism and be motivated to ''act'' on the message.&lt;ref name=HackmanOldham1980&gt;J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RalphKatz2013&gt;Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. ''[[IEEE Technology Management Council|IEEE Engineering Management Review]]'', Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28–38&lt;/ref&gt;  

Not all criticisms have all these features, but if one or more of them is missing, the criticism is less likely to achieve its goal. Almost all guidelines for criticism mention these seven points, although in particular contexts their meaning may be more exactly specified (for example, what it means to be "articulate and persuasive" can vary according to the circumstances).

===={{Visible anchor|Lousy|Lousy criticism}}====
Logically, there are just as many ways to get a criticism wrong as to get the criticism right. 
*Criticism is made at the '''wrong time and place''': people might accept that the critic has a point, but "they can't do anything about it now."
*Criticism is '''too long''': people get confused over what it is all about, they get lost in it, and become disoriented. 
*Criticism is '''vague''': people are likely to say, "so what"?
*Criticism is '''inappropriate''', or the critic is not really in a position to make it: people will say "you're way out of line".
*Criticism has '''no clear target''': people are likely just to conclude that "so-and-so is in a bad mood right now" or "he's had too much of it."
*Criticism '''assigns blame or states problems without suggesting solutions''' ("empty criticism"): people are likely to conclude this information is not very useful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar H. Schein]] (with Peter S. DeLisi, Paul J. Kampas and Michael Sonduck), ''DEC is Dead, Long Live DEC – The Lasting Legacy of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (Lessons on Innovation, Technology and the Business Gene)'', [[Berrett-Koehler Publishers]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Critic did '''no research before making the criticism''': people will say, "very interesting, but this cuts no ice."
*Criticism has '''no clear motivation''': "why are you telling me this, and why are you telling me about it now?". 
*Critic makes '''bad criticisms regularly''': it discredits the critic. 

The main effect of lousy criticism is usually that, rather than clarifying things, it becomes disorienting or confusing to people. Therefore, lousy criticism is usually regarded as unhelpful, or as an unwanted distraction getting in the way of things. The only thing a lousy criticism achieves is to make it clear that somebody has an objection (although the objection is not well-taken).

===Techniques of constructive criticism===
Techniques of constructive criticism aim to improve the behavior or the behavioral results of a person, while consciously avoiding personal attacks and blaming. This kind of criticism is carefully framed in language acceptable to the target person, often acknowledging that the critics themselves could be wrong. Insulting language and hostile language are avoided, and phrases are used like "I feel..." and "It's my understanding that..." and so on. Constructive critics try to stand in the shoes of the person  criticized, and consider what things would look like from their perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ross Bonander |url=http://www.askmen.com/money/how_to_250/275_how_to.html |title=AskMen How to: Give Constructive Criticism |publisher=Askmen.com |date=2008-10-19 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giving and receiving the message====

Some people are not open to any criticism at all, even constructive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-constructive-criticism.htm |title=WiseGeek What is Constructive Criticism? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date=2013-10-19 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is an art to truly constructive criticism: being well-intentioned is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for constructively criticizing, since one can have good intentions but poor delivery ("I don't know why my girlfriend keeps getting mad when I tell her to stop with the fries already; I'm just concerned about her weight"), or egocentric intentions but appropriate delivery ("I'm sick of my subordinate coming in late for work, so I took her aside and we had a long, compassionate talk about her work-life balance. I think she bought it."). As the name suggests, the consistent and central notion is that the criticism must have the aim of constructing, scaffolding, or improving a situation, something which is generally obstructed by hostile language or personal attacks.

People can sometimes be afraid to express a criticism, or afraid to be criticized. Criticism can "press all the wrong buttons." The threat of criticism can be sufficient to silence people, or cause them to stay away. So self-confidence can play a big role in criticism – the confidence to criticize, and the confidence to face criticism. If people's emotions are not properly considered, criticism can fail to succeed, even although it is well-intentioned, or perfectly sensible. Hence criticism is often considered an "art", because it involves human insight into "what one can say and cannot say" in the given situation.

====Hamburger method====

One style of constructive criticism employs the "hamburger method",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n8tip.com/the-hamburger-method-of-constructive-criticism-works-for-vegetarians-too |title=The Hamburger Method of Constructive Criticism |publisher=N8tip.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which each potentially harsh criticism (the "meat") is surrounded by compliments (the "buns"). The idea is to help the person being criticized feel more comfortable, and assure the person that the critic's perspective is not entirely negative. This is a specific application of the more general principle that criticism should be focused on maintaining healthy relationships, and be mindful of the positive as well as the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/articles/2001/08/23257.html |title=The 4-1-1 On Constructive Criticism |publisher=Inc.com |date=2001-08-03 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopathology===

The psychopathology of criticism refers to the study of unhealthy forms of criticism, and of unhealthy kinds of response to criticism. Psychologists often associate these with particular categories of mental disorders, especially personality disorders, as classified in the U.S. [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (this manual is also used in other countries, although the forms of personality disorders can be somewhat different in different countries, reflecting ethnic differences and differences in social systems).
*'''Low [[self-esteem]]''': emotionally vulnerable individuals that are often excessively sensitive to criticism, or to being defeated, they can't handle it. 
*'''[[Narcissistic personality disorder]]''': although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may "haunt" or leave them feeling [[humiliated]], degraded, hollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, [[revenge]], [[narcissistic rage]], or defiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe07.html |title=Internet Mental Health |publisher=Mentalhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narcissists]] are extremely sensitive to personal criticism and extremely critical of other people. They think they must be seen as [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfect]] or superior or infallible or else they are worthless. There's no middle ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.halcyon.com/jmashmun/npd/traits.html#critic |title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) : How to Recognize a Narcissist |publisher=Halcyon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Paranoid personality disorder]]''': these people are often rigidly critical of others, but have great difficulty accepting criticism themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe01.html |title=Internet Mental Health – paranoid personality disorder |publisher=Mentalhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Avoidant personality disorder]]''': these people are hypersensitive to criticism or rejection. They build up a defensive shell. If the criticism seems to imply something bad about them, a defensive shell immediately snaps into place.
*'''[[Dependent personality disorder]]''': individuals that will often apologize and "self-correct" in response to criticism at the drop of a hat.
*'''Hypercriticism''': these people are often regarded as [[anal retentive]] or nitpickers (see [[nagging]]). Nitpickers engage in minute, trivial, and unjustified faultfinding to excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nitpicking |title=nitpicking - definition of nitpicking by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagging means endless scolding, complaints, and faultfinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nagging |title=nagging – definition of nagging by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hypocriticism''': these individuals are [[hypocrites]] who criticize and accuse others about the vice that they are guilty of themselves.&lt;ref name="dictdotcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrite |title=Definition of "Hypocrite" on dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypocrisy]] contains some kind of deception, and therefore involves a kind of lying.&lt;ref name="dictdotcom" /&gt; 

To understand pathological criticism and pathological responses to criticism, it is often not sufficient to see the individuals concerned in isolation – they should be placed in the total context in which the criticism or the response to it occurs. Particular situations can "bring out" the "bad side" of people, which in the normal run of events would not occur. Pathological criticism occurs especially in situations of intense conflict or competition, where the normal internal and external controls on people's behaviour begin to break down. Not just personal change but also a "change of scene" may be required to get rid of the disorder.

A term describing pathologic criticism may be used as [[ad hominem|argumentum ad hominem]] without proven diagnosis (see also ''anti-psychiatry movement'').

===Anti-psychiatry movement===
{{main|Anti-psychiatry|Political abuse of psychiatry}}
The anti-psychiatry movement opposes labeling persons who engage in criticism as having a "disease" (or "abuse" or "addiction"). 
*The medicalization of criticism rejects the criticism as a disease. The critics are '''silenced''', and their viewpoint is denied. They are regarded as incapable of sensible criticism, but their disease often cannot be proved – other than saying that voicing a criticism in a certain way is proof of a disease.
*''Why'' exactly a criticism is "unhealthy" can be '''difficult to prove''', nevermind its rights or wrongs – it could be subjective interpretation, a matter of personal likes and dislikes, or a matter of point of view. What is "healthy" or "unhealthy" might depend on the context, or on how it is understood. 
*People labelled as "ill" cannot be held morally '''responsible''' for their critical utterances, but people can often choose their own behaviour with regard to criticism, and they should take responsibility for their own behaviour, if they can practically do so.
*Even if it is possible to kill the criticism with a pill, the cause or the target of the criticism may '''not go away'''. A bad situation may remain; the only difference is that somebody is doped sufficiently, so that no overt criticism is made or received. 

Confronted with unhealthy criticism or unhealthy responses to criticism, it may be unwise to get scared, and it may be unnecessary to run to the doctor straightaway. It may be sufficient to talk it out, even if it is not the most pleasant discussion. If people are simply labelled "ill", they get away with behaviour{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} that, arguably, they ought to be taking responsibility for, themselves. It should not be too easily assumed that people are incapable of making conscious choices about their own behaviour, unless they are deranged (crazy), in great pain, extraordinarily confused, heavily intoxicated, or in some way trapped or locked down.

===Authority issues===
Criticism can cause harm as well as good things. Criticism can hurt or people can feel offended. It can “upset the apple cart”, cause chaos, or do real damage. For these reasons, people often try to keep the flow of criticism under control with rules.  Such rules often state:
*Who has the right to criticize, and who isn’t allowed to criticize.
*Who or what can be criticized, and who or what cannot be criticized.
*What sorts of criticism are acceptable.
*When and how the criticism may be made (the appropriate situations and formats for criticism). 
*What counts as an appropriate motivation for criticism.
These rules can be successful if people accept them, and work with them. But it can also happen that a criticism can only be made “against the rules.” In that case, a conflict can develop between the critics and the people in charge, where the authorities  try to enforce the rules, and the critics try to make their criticism regardless. The conflict could be ended in many different ways; but usually it is difficult to suppress a valid criticism altogether, permanently. A lot of critical activity may consist simply of a battle to get one’s ideas taken seriously.

==Purpose==
Here the purpose of criticism and its relative merits in particular situations are discussed.

===Negative arguments===
Criticism may not be a positive response to an individual, action, or belief in all circumstances. There are two reasons that this might be the case:

*The recipient of the critique may be hurt by it. This is particularly true when the object of criticism is personal (a political or religious belief, for example) or when the critique is composed in a malicious way, rather than in an attempt to improve the recipient.
*The critique may not result in any positive change. If the critique is not written in a persuasive manner, if the recipient of the criticism isn't willing to acknowledge their faults, or if the recipient lacks the resources needed for change, then the critique will not have an impact.

===Affirmative arguments===

However, there are also significant reasons why a critique may be necessary or desirable in particular situations.

*Diagnosis and error correction: critiques identify the limitations of the object of criticism. A film critic, for example, might discuss the extent to which a particular film was able to communicate a theme. Criticisms also identify prejudices, biases, and hidden assumptions.
*Improvement: by evaluating the ability of an individual, action, or idea to accomplish a given objective, critiques identify possible improvement areas. Criticisms may also present alternative perspectives or suggestions, both of which facilitate improvement.
*Ethical implications: critiques of societal norms or public policies have the potential to effect a large number of people in a profound way and are thus ethically desirable{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9193">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[higher-dimensional algebra]] and [[homotopy theory]], a '''double groupoid''' generalises the notion of [[groupoid]] and of [[category (mathematics)|category]] to a higher dimension.

== Definition ==
A '''double groupoid''' '''D''' is a higher-dimensional [[groupoid]] involving a relationship for both `horizontal' and `vertical' groupoid structures.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald and C.B. Spencer: "Double groupoids and crossed modules", ''Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff.''. '''17''' (1976), 343–362&lt;/ref&gt; (A double groupoid can also be considered as a generalization of certain higher-dimensional groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald, [http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm Higher-dimensional group theory] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723235509/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm |date=2012-07-23 }} explains how the groupoid concept has led to higher-dimensional homotopy groupoids, having applications in [[homotopy theory]] and in group [[cohomology]]&lt;/ref&gt;) The geometry of squares and their [[Function composition|compositions]] leads to a common representation of a ''double groupoid'' in the following [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]]:

[[Image:Dgpd8fdp02.jpg|Double groupoid diagram]]

where '''M''' is a set of 'points', '''H''' and '''V''' are, respectively, 'horizontal' and 'vertical' groupoids, and '''S''' is a set of 'squares' with two compositions. The [[Function composition|composition laws]] for a double groupoid '''D''' make it also describable as a groupoid internal to the [[Groupoid|category of groupoids]].

Given two groupoids '''H''' and '''V''' over a set '''M''', there is a double groupoid &lt;math&gt;\Box(H,V)&lt;/math&gt; with '''H,V''' as horizontal and vertical edge groupoids, and squares given by quadruples

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

for which one assumes always that h, h′ are in '''H''' and v, v′ are in '''V''', and that the initial and final points of these edges match in '''M''' as suggested by the notation; that is for example sh = sv, th = sv', ..., etc. The compositions are to be inherited from those of '''H,V'''; that is:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix} \circ_1
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h'&amp; \\[-0.9ex] w &amp; &amp; w'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h''&amp; \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] vw &amp; &amp; v'w'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h''&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix} \circ_2
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; k&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v' &amp; &amp; v''\\[-0.9ex]&amp; k'&amp; \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; hk&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v''\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'k'&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This construction is the right adjoint to the forgetful functor which takes the double groupoid as above, to the pair of groupoids '''H,V''' over '''M'''.

Other related constructions are that of a double groupoid with connection&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/DoubleGroupoidWithConnection.html Double Groupoid with Connection&lt;/ref&gt; and homotopy double groupoids.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R., Hardie, K., Kamps, H. and T. Porter: 2002, "The homotopy double groupoid of a Hausdorff space.", ''Theory and Applications of Categories'': '''10''', 71–93&lt;/ref&gt; The homotopy double groupoid of a pair of pointed spaces is a key element of the proof of a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, first proved by Brown and Higgins in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R. and Higgins, P.J. "On the connection between the second relative homotopy groups of some related spaces". _Proc. London Math. Soc._ (3) (36)(1978) 193–212&lt;/ref&gt; and given an extensive treatment in the book.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, [http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html ''Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids"], EMS Tracts in Mathematics Vol. 15, 703 pages. (August
2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homotopy double groupoid==
A generalisation to dimension 2 of the fundamental groupoid on a set of base was given by Brown and Higgins in 1978 as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;(X,A,C)&lt;/math&gt; be a triple of spaces, i.e. &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt; \rho(X,A,C)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of homotopy classes rel vertices of maps of a square into '''X''' which take the edges into '''A''' and the vertices into '''C'''. It is not entirely trivial to prove that the natural compositions of such squares in two directions are inherited by these homotopy classes to give a double groupoid, which also has an extra structure of so-called connections necessary to discuss the idea of commutative cube in a double groupoid.  This double groupoid is used in an essential way to prove a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which gives new information and computations on second relative homotopy groups as part of a crossed module. For more information, see Part I of the [http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html book] by Brown, Higgins, Sivera listed below,.

==Convolution algebra==
A ''convolution C*-algebra'' of a double groupoid can also be constructed by employing the square diagram '''D''' of a double groupoid.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/DoubleGroupoidGeometry.html Double Groupoid Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double groupoid category ==
The [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are double groupoids and whose morphisms are double groupoid [[homomorphisms]] that are double groupoid diagram ('''D''') [[functors]] is called the '''double groupoid category''', or the '''category of double groupoids'''.

'''Duck typing''' in computer programming is an application of the [[duck test]]&amp;mdash;"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"&amp;mdash;to determine if an [[object (computer science)|object]] can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing|title=Glossary — Python 3.7.1 documentation|website=docs.python.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Example==
This is a simple example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] 3 that demonstrates how any object may be used in any context, up until it is used in a way that it does not support.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=Python&gt;
class Duck:
    def fly(self):
        print("Duck flying")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane flying")

class Whale:
    def swim(self):
        print("Whale swimming")

def lift_off(entity):
    entity.fly()

duck = Duck()
airplane = Airplane()
whale = Whale()

lift_off(duck) # prints `Duck flying`
lift_off(airplane) # prints `Airplane flying`
lift_off(whale) # Throws the error `'Whale' object has no attribute 'fly'`
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==In statically typed languages==
Certain usually [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] and the version 4 release of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have extra type annotations&lt;ref&gt;[http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing Boo: Duck Typing] {{webarchive |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081006075246/http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ericwhite/archive/2008/10/29/anders-hejlsberg-introduces-c-4-0-at-pdc-2008.aspx|title=Anders Hejlsberg Introduces C# 4.0 at PDC 2008|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that instruct the compiler to arrange for type checking of classes to occur at run-time rather than compile time, and include run-time type checking code in the compiled output.

Templates in C++ allow the language to use compile-time duck typing. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/templates-and-duck-typing/184401971|title=Templates and Duck Typing|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other type systems==

===Structural type systems===
Duck typing is similar to, but distinct from [[Structural type system|structural typing]]. Structural typing is a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type's structure, whereas duck typing is [[Type system#Dynamic typing|dynamic]] and determines type compatibility by only that part of a type's structure that is accessed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

The [[OCaml]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Elm (programming language)|Elm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.elm-lang.org/core_language.html|title=Core Language · An Introduction to Elm|first=Evan|last=Czaplicki|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gosu (programming language)|Gosu]] and PureScript languages support structural typing to varying degrees.

===Protocols and Interfaces===
[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|Protocols and interfaces]] can provide some of the benefits of duck typing, but duck typing is distinct in that no explicit interface is defined. For example, if a third party library implements a class that cannot be modified, a client cannot use an instance of it with an interface unknown to that library even if the class does in fact satisfy the interface requirements. (A common solution to this problem is the [[Adapter pattern]].) Duck typing would allow this. Again, all of an interface must be satisfied for compatibility.

===Templates or generic types===
[[Template metaprogramming|Template]], or [[Generic programming|generic]] functions or methods apply the duck test in a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] context; this brings all the advantages and disadvantages of [[Type system#Static and dynamic type checking in practice|static versus dynamic type checking]] in general. Duck typing can also be more flexible in that only the methods ''actually called at run time'' need to be implemented, while templates require implementation of all methods that ''cannot be proven [[Unreachable code|unreachable]] at compile time''.

Examples include the languages [[C++]] and [[D (programming language)|D]] with templates, which developed from [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] generics.

== Duck Typing in scikit-learn project ==
A possible advantage of duck typing over inheritance is used in the API design for scikit-learn. There the interface dictates how the estimator functions are defined and for adding new functions you do not have to inherit any classes. There duck typing helps in decoupling the code from the API design hence making it easier for others to contribute to and extend the existing library. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buitinck|first=Lars|last2=Louppe|first2=Gilles|last3=Blondel|first3=Mathieu|last4=Pedregosa|first4=Fabian|last5=Mueller|first5=Andreas|last6=Grisel|first6=Olivier|last7=Niculae|first7=Vlad|last8=Prettenhofer|first8=Peter|last9=Gramfort|first9=Alexandre|date=2013-09-23|title=API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00856511|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Criticism of the term itself ===
Use of the term "duck typing" has been considered superfluous in light of the fact that other terms, such as [[Late binding|dynamic binding]], express the concept more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ericlippert.com/2014/01/02/what-is-duck-typing/comment-page-1/ |title=What is "duck typing"?

In [[philosophy]], '''emergentism''' is the belief in [[emergence]], particularly as it involves [[consciousness]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and as it contrasts (or not) with [[reductionism]]. A property of a [[system]] is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself  different from them.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Timothy and Wong, Hong Yu, "Emergent Properties", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/properties-emergent/&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other properties. The different ways in which this independence requirement can be satisfied lead to variant types of emergence.

== Forms ==
All varieties of emergentism strive to be compatible with [[physicalism]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the theory that the universe is composed exclusively of physical entities, and in particular with the evidence relating changes in the brain with changes in mental functioning. Many forms of emergentism, including proponents of complex adaptive systems, do not hold a material but rather a relational or processural view of the universe. Furthermore, they view [[mind–body dualism]] as a conceptual error insofar as mind and body are merely different types of relationships. As a theory of mind (which it is not always), emergentism differs from [[idealism]], [[eliminative materialism]], [[identity theory of mind|identity theories]], [[neutral monism]], [[panpsychism]], and [[substance dualism]], whilst being closely associated with [[property dualism]]. It is generally not obvious whether an emergent theory of mind embraces [[mental causation]] or must be considered [[epiphenomenal]].

Some varieties of emergentism are not specifically concerned with the [[mind–body problem]], and instead suggest a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] or layered view of the whole of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing [[complexity]] with each requiring its own [[special science]]. Typically [[physics]] ([[mathematical physics]], [[particle physics]], and [[classical physics]]) is basic, with [[chemistry]] built on top of it, then [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[social sciences]]. Reductionists respond that the arrangement of the sciences is a matter of convenience, and that chemistry is derivable from physics (and so forth) ''in principle'', an argument which gained force after the establishment of a quantum-mechanical basis for chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, T. ''The Significance of Emergence''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other varieties see [[mind]] or [[consciousness]] as specifically and anomalously requiring emergentist explanation, and therefore constitute a family of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]]. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] summarises this view as ''"the soul is more than the sum of its parts"''. A number of philosophers have offered the argument that [[qualia]] constitute the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and resist reductive explanation in a way that all other phenomena do not. In contrast, reductionists generally see the task of accounting for the possibly atypical properties of mind and of living things as a matter of showing that, contrary to appearances, such properties are indeed fully accountable in terms of the properties of the basic constituents of nature and therefore in no way genuinely atypical.

Intermediate positions are possible: for instance, some emergentists hold that emergence is neither universal nor restricted to consciousness, but applies to (for instance) living creatures, or [[self-organising]] systems, or [[complex systems]].

Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, an idea known as [[downward causation]]. Others maintain that higher-order properties simply [[supervene]] over lower levels without direct causal interaction.

All the cases so far discussed have been synchronic, i.e. the emergent property exists simultaneously with its basis.
Yet another variation operates diachronically. Emergentists of this type believe that ''genuinely novel properties'' can come into being, without being accountable in terms of the preceding history of the universe. (Contrast with [[indeterminism]] where it is only the ''arrangement or configuration'' of matter that is unaccountable). These evolution-inspired theories often have a [[theological]] aspect, as in the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

== Relationship to vitalism ==

A refinement of [[vitalism]] may be recognized in contemporary molecular histology in the proposal that some key organising and structuring features of organisms, perhaps including even life itself, are examples of [[emergence|emergent process]]es; those in which a complexity arises, out of interacting chemical processes forming interconnected feedback cycles, that cannot fully be described in terms of those processes since the system as a whole has properties that the constituent reactions lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = SG | title = A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = C13–23 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = SF | last2 = Sarkar | first2 = S | title = Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 219 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10974666 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emergent system properties should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653-693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In a light-hearted millennial vein, Kirshner and Michison call research into integrated cell and organismal physiology “molecular vitalism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81685-2 | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = M | last2 = Gerhart | first2 = J | last3 = Mitchison | first3 = T | year = 2000 | title = Molecular "vitalism | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 1| pages = 79–88 | pmid = 10647933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and crossdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems."&lt;ref name ="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) EXPLAINING EMERGENCE:towards an ontology of levels. Journal for General Philosophy of Science [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an [[intellectual tranquilizer]] or [[verbal sedative]]—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===John Stuart Mill===
[[John Stuart Mill]] outlined his version of emergentism in ''[[System of Logic]]'' (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, such as those in which [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic forces]] combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the "[[Composition of Causes]]". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to more than the sums of the properties of their parts.

Mill believed that various [[chemical reaction]]s (poorly understood in his time) could provide examples of emergent properties, although some critics believe that modern [[physical chemistry]] has shown that these reactions can be given satisfactory [[reductionist]] explanations. For instance, it has been claimed by Dirac that the whole of chemistry is, in principle,
contained in the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=April 2016}}

===C. D. Broad===
British philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defended a realistic [[epistemology]] in ''[[The Mind and its Place in Nature]]'' (1925) arguing that [[emergent materialism]] is the most likely solution to the mind–body problem.

Broad defined emergence as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Put in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there are certain wholes, composed (say)
of constituents A, B, and C in a relation R to each other; that all wholes composed of
constituents of the same kind as A, B, and C in relations of the same kind as R have certain
characteristic properties; that A, B, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of complex
where the relation is not of the same kind as R; and that the characteristic properties of the
whole R(A, B, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the most complete knowledge of
the properties of A, B, and C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the form R(A, B,
C).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition amounted to the claim that mental properties would count as emergent if and only if [[philosophical zombie]]s were metaphysically possible{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Many philosophers take this position to be inconsistent with some formulations of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[supervenience]].

===C. Lloyd Morgan and Samuel Alexander===
[[Samuel Alexander]]'s views on emergentism, argued in ''[[Space, Time, and Deity]]'' (1920), were inspired in part by the ideas in psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]]'s ''[[Emergent evolution|Emergent Evolution]]''. Alexander believed that emergence was fundamentally inexplicable, and that emergentism was simply a "brute empirical fact":

"The higher quality emerges from the lower level of existence and has its roots therein, but it emerges therefrom, and it does not belong to that level, but constitutes its possessor a new order of existent with its special laws of behaviour. The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the “natural piety” of the investigator. It admits no explanation." ([[Space, Time, and Deity]])

Despite the causal and explanatory gap between the phenomena on different levels, Alexander held that emergent qualities were ''not'' [[epiphenomenal]]. His view can perhaps best be described as a form of [[non-reductive physicalism]] (NRP) or [[supervenience]] theory.

=== Ludwig von Bertalanffy ===
[[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] founded [[general system theory]] (GST), which is a more contemporary approach to emergentism. A popularization of many of the elements of GST may be found in ''[[The Web of Life]]'' by [[Fritjof Capra]].

=== Jaegwon Kim ===
[[Image:Figure1.gif|thumb|right|Figure demonstration how M1 and M2 are not reduced to P1 and P2.]]
Addressing emergentism  (under the guise of [[non-reductive physicalism]]) as a solution to the [[mind–body problem]] [[Jaegwon Kim]] has raised an objection based on [[causal closure]] and [[overdetermination]].

Emergentism strives to be compatible with physicalism, and physicalism, according to Kim, has a principle of causal closure according to which every physical event is fully accountable in terms of physical causes. This seems to leave no "room"
for [[mental causation]] to operate. If our bodily movements were caused by the preceding state of our bodies ''and'' our decisions and intentions, they would be overdetermined. Mental causation in this sense is not
the same as [[free will]], but is only the claim that mental states are causally relevant. If emergentists respond by abandoning the idea of mental causation, their position becomes a form of [[epiphenomenalism]].

In detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that ''M1'' causes ''M2'' (these are mental events) and ''P1'' causes ''P2'' (these are physical events). ''P1'' realises ''M1'' and ''P2'' realises ''M2''. However ''M1'' does not causally effect ''P1'' (i.e., ''M1'' is a [[consequent]] event of ''P1''). If ''P1'' causes ''P2'', and ''M1'' is a result of ''P1'', then ''M2'' is a result of ''P2''. He says that the only alternatives to this problem is to accept [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] (where the mental events are independent of the physical events) or [[eliminativism]] (where the mental events do not exist).&lt;!--Crane and Sperry-http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAAOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mac.com%2Fcranetim%2FTims_website%2FOnline_papers_files%2FSignificance%2520of%2520emergence.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=sperry%20emergentism&amp;ei=RKBtTZipM4is8AOZ262RBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTERxqtuGVtJkSRPN2oLVodix0rw&amp;cad=rja--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">An '''eye poke''', '''eye jab''', '''eye stab''', '''eye strike''' or '''poke in the eye''' is a strike at the eye or eyes of a human or animal.  It is typically made with the fingers which may either be forked to jab both eyes or held together, like a bird's beak, to strike with force and protect the fingers from damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Eye Jab |page=60 |title=Martial Arts Techniques for Law Enforcement |author=Mike Young |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8048-3794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=32 |title=Complete Krav Maga |chapter=Eye Strike |author=Darren Levine, John Whitman |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-56975-573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack became better known among the public due to its use in comedy; the idea of using it to entertain was likely invented by the [[vaudeville]]  duo of [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|title=Mixed nuts: America's love affair with comedy teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=1-58648-190-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self defense==
In a street fight situation, when one's opponent may be trying to inflict serious harm, martial arts expert [[Kelly McCann]] advises that the eyes should be a "persistent primary target".&lt;ref name = "kelly"/&gt; An eye poke needs little power to be effective, and it can stop even highly determined attackers. If the hand is kept at an approximately 45° angle to the opponent's face during the strike, there is less risk of hurting ones fingers, and even if they do not connect with the eye, the palm can impact on the opponent's face.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;''Combatives for street survival '', by [[Kelly McCann]], Black Belt Books, {{ISBN|0-89750-176-4}}, (2010, second edition) p 126&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Perhaps not a well known source to the average academic, this is considered one of the most authoritative books on street fighting, its been enthusiastically endorsed by celebrated warriors including [[Alfred M.

The eye poke was a signature move in the [[slapstick]] antics of the comedy and vaudeville act [[The Three Stooges]], who mastered the technique.

In mathematics, an '''F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set''' (said '''F-sigma set''')  is a [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[closed set]]s. The notation originated in [[France]] with F for ''[[wikt:fermé#French|fermé]]'' (''[[French language|French]]'': closed) and σ for ''[[wikt:somme#French|somme]]'' (''French'': sum, union).&lt;ref name="ramtihs"&gt;{{citation|title=Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces|first1=Elias M.|last1=Stein|first2=Rami|last2=Shakarchi|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9781400835560|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Sg3Vug65AsC&amp;pg=PA23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[metrizable]] spaces, every [[open set]] is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|first1=Charalambos D.|last1=Aliprantis|first2=Kim|last2=Border|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9783540295877|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vyXtR3vUhoC&amp;pg=PA138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The complement of an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set is a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt; set]].&lt;ref name="ramtihs"/&gt; In a metrizable space, any closed set is a G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

The union of countably many F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; sets is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set, and the intersection of finitely many F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; sets is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.  F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}^0_2&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Borel hierarchy]].

== Examples ==

Each closed set is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of rationals is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of irrationals is not a F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

In a Tychonoff space, each countable set is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set, because a point &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

For example, the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Point (geometry)|point]]s &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Cartesian plane]] such that &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt; is [[rational number|rational]] is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set because it can be expressed as the union of all the [[line (mathematics)|line]]s passing through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] with rational [[slope (mathematics)|slope]]:

:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}} \{(ry,y) \mid y \in \mathbb{R}\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of rational numbers, which is a countable set.

The '''grid format''' has been an important component of [[avant-garde]] visual art throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Early appearances of the grid format include work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Kazimir Malevich]] and other artists belonging to the [[De stijl|De Stijl]] and Constructivist movements. The grid format also features prominently in minimalist and conceptual art of the 60's and 70's. The art theorist Rosalind Krauss writes,

"In the temporal dimension, the grid is an emblem of modernity by being just that: the form that is ubiquitous in the art of our century, while appearing nowhere, nowhere at all, in the art of the last one. In that great chain of reactions by which modernism was born out of the efforts of the nineteenth century, one final shift resulted in breaking the chain. By "discovering" the grid, cubism, de Stijl, Mondrian, Malevich . .. landed in a place that was out of reach of everything that went before. Which is to say, they landed in the present, and everything else was declared to be the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krauss|first=Rosalind|authorlink = Rosalind E. Krauss|title=Grids|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1050153.files/Grids_Rosalind%20Krauss.pdf|format= pdf |journal=[[October (journal)|October]]|date=Summer 1979|volume=9|pages=50–64 |jstor= 778321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable occurrences of the grid format include [[Sol LeWitt|Sol Lewitt]]'s modular structures, [[Chuck close|Chuck Close]]'s photorealist grids and more recently in [[Damien Hirst]]'s Spot Paintings. Other contemporary artists such as [[Penelope Umbrico]] have used it to imply non-hierarchical organization in massive collections of objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Human-rating certification''', also known as '''man-rating''', is the certification of a [[spacecraft]] or [[launch vehicle]] as capable of safely transporting humans. (Since the 1990s, NASA and the U.S. [[GAO]] prefer to use "human-rating" instead of "man-rating" when describing requirements for these systems.)

According to [[NASA]], human-rating requires not just that a system is designed to be tolerant of failure and to protect the crew even if unrecoverable failure occurs, but also that astronauts aboard a human-rated spacecraft must have some control over it.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=8705&amp;s=2C |title=Human Rating Requirements for Space Systems |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of technical requirements and the associated certification process for crewed space systems is required in addition to the standards and requirements that are mandatory for all of NASA's space flight programs.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

==NASA Commercial Crew Program==
In November 2011, [[Ed Mango (NASA)|Ed Mango]], the agency head of the NASA [[Commercial Crew Program]] (CCP), gave an extended interview on the new NASA requirements for human rating of spacecraft that will fly to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116&gt;
{{cite news |last=Chaikin|first=Andrew|title=Certified Safe:  Planning to operate a taxi service for NASA astronauts? Here’s what’s required. |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/Certified-Safe.html |accessdate=2011-11-27 |newspaper=Air &amp; Space Smithsonian |date=2011-11-16 |quote=''we've separated [the “loss of crew” criteria] into what you need for ascent and what you need for entry. For ascent it’s 1 in 500, and independently for entry it’s 1 in 500. ... The probability for the mission itself is 1 in 270. That is an overall number. That’s loss of crew for the entire mission profile, including ascent, on-orbit, and entry. The thing that drives the 1 in 270 is really micrometeorites and orbital debris ... whatever things that are in space that you can collide with. So that’s what drops that number down, because you’ve got to look at the 210 days, the fact that your heat shield or something might be exposed to whatever that debris is for that period of time. NASA looks at Loss of Vehicle the same as Loss of Crew.  If the vehicle is damaged and it may not be detected prior to de-orbit, then you have loss of crew.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA CCP human-rating standards require that the [[probability]] of a loss on ascent is no more than 1 in 500, and that the probability of a loss on descent is no more than 1 in 500.  The overall mission loss risk, which includes vehicle risk from [[micrometeorite]]s and [[space debris|orbital debris]] while in orbit for up to 210 days, is required to be no more than 1 in 270.&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;  Maximum sustained [[g-force|G-loads]] are limited to three [[Gravity of Earth|Earth-standard g's]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;

The development of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] pre-dates the NASA Human-Rating requirements. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia]] accidents, the criteria used by NASA for human-rating spacecraft have been made more stringent.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew/&gt;

The [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) published{{when|date=November 2011}} a paper submitted to [[AIAA]] detailing the modifications to its [[Delta IV]] and [[Atlas V]] launch vehicles that would be needed to conform to NASA Standard 8705.2B.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew&gt;
{{Cite web |url=https://www.ulalaunch.com/docs/default-source/human-rating/human-rating-atlas-v-and-delta-iv.pdf |title = Atlas and Delta Capabilities to Launch Crew to Low Earth Orbit |date=n.d. |publisher=United Launch Alliance |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ULA has since been awarded $6.7 million under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program for development of an [[Emergency Detection System]], one of the final pieces that would be needed to make these launchers suitable for human spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA and ULA confirm Atlas V baseline for human rated launches|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/nasa-ula-confirm-atlas-v-baseline-human-rated-launches/|website=NASASpaceflight.com|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12613">Since 2002, the '''Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies''' has been developed by [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] and his team at the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], Austria. On January 1, 2017 a Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was established at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences, which has a mandate for conducting Peace and Conflict Studies Research and is home to the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies, with its UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

== Research and Publications ==
The Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies became famous for its unique approach to peace research with the key phrase “transrational peaces” and with its specific and tough training method in the sense of [[John Paul Lederach]]'s elicitive conflict transformation”. Both principles are applied in practice and developed further in the frame of the MA Program for Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): MA Program, available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ma-program/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO Chair promotes further research in these fields and the publication of the respective results, in the following book series:
* Many Peaces Trilogy (Palgrave) by Wolfgang Dietrich: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture (Vol. 1), Elicitive Conflict Transformation and the Transrational Shift in Peace Politics (Vol.2) and Elicitive Conflict Mapping (Vol 3, in translation).
* Elicitivas (Verlag Springer, featuring Juan José Albert Gutiérrez (translated by Matthias Gossner) and Winfried Wagner.
* Masters of Peace (LIT, Verlag Springer), featuring the works of Samrat Schmiem Kumar, Katya Buchleitner, Paula Ditzel Facci, Paul Bukuluki, Natalia Lozano Mancera, Alicia Dueck, Catalina Vallejo Piedrahíta, [https://www.prio.org/People/Person/?x=8154 Noor Jdid], Kathleen McGoey, Billene Seyoum Woldeyes, Sophie Friedel, [http://adhamhamed.com Adham Hamed], Morten Frederiksen, Heela Najibullah and Jennie Sandstad.

Furthermore, a series of edited Volumes has emerged in the framework of the Innsbruck School:
Key Texts of Peace Studies (Die Kommende Demokratie Series, LIT)
Palgrave Handbook of Peace Studies (Palgrave)
Transrational Resonances (Palgrave)

[[Norbert Koppensteiner]],&lt;ref&gt;Koppensteiner, Norbert (2014): Norbert Koppensteiner: Home. Available at URL: http://koppensteiner.wissweb.at, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a Dietrich-student and program coordinator at the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation, is another important representative of the Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies. In his book The Art of the Transpersonal Self he draws on findings of humanistic and transpersonal psychology. His work can be seen as a critique of some of Modernity’s founding principles like truth. Koppensteiner argues that the autonomous and self grounded subject, morals or solvability of conflicts have become sites of contestation and debate. He suggests to re-think some of those categories being debated in (post)modernity by invoking transpersonal and transrational transpositions. Asking about the continued possibilities for subjectivation, Koppensteiner sketches the outlines of an art of living for a subjectivity perceived as constantly emergent and in transformation, a subjectivity that dares to embrace conflict as part of its transpersonal relational becoming and that emerges through an ongoing transformation of the self understood as an aesthetic (Apollonian) and energetic (Dionysian) practice. The strictly relational understanding of peaces and conflict that Koppensteiner proposes is one of the central ontological assumptions of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies.

Other important representatives of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies are Josefina Echavarría (Research and Publications Coordinator), Daniela Ingruber (Coordinator MA Program), Jennifer Murphy and Andreas Oberprantacher. Each academic year leading international scholars of Peace and Conflict Studies visit the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program at the University of Innsbruck.

=== Transrational Peace Philosophy ===
The Innsbruck School of Peace Studies is based on [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]'s transrational approach to Peace Studies and is outlined in his Many Peaces Trilogy. Spanning continents as well as disciplines, Dietrich presents a panorama of diverse interpretations of peace in world history and culture. In a journey through time and space, Dietrich outlines the so-called five families of peace - energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational. He stresses the importance of combining rationality and reason with human properties such as emotion and spirituality in applied peace work. This ontological assumption indicates a paradigm shift and proposes a new epistemological understanding of peace, which is at the heart of the Innsbruck School's peace philosophy.

=== Elicitive Conflict Transformation ===
Elicitive Conflict Transformation was first introduced to the field by John Paul Lederach in 1995 and is the applied method of transrational peace philosophy. Drawing on the debate on [[multi-track diplomacy]], Lederach initially distinguished between three levels of conflict: 
# Top Leaders
# Middle-Range Leaders
# Grassroots

Wolfgang Dietrich draws on Lederach's systemic approach to conflict and developed a multi-layered model of conflict analysis. Furthermore, he systematizes elective conflict transformation techniques in three main groups: 
# Voice Oriented Approaches to Conflict Transformation; e.g. non-violent communication after Marshall Rosenberg and Theme-Centered Interaction after Ruth Cohn.
# Body-oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. [[Theatre for Living]] after [[David Diamond (theatre)|David Diamond]], Butho- and Five Rhythms Dance, after Gabrielle Roth
# breath oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. Holotropic Breathwork after [[Stanislav Grof]] and Sylvester Walch.

All three types of approaches to conflict share a strong reference to systems theory and hence a strictly relational understanding of conflicts.

=== Elicitive Conflict Mapping ===
Elicitive Conflict Mapping is a brand-new tool that has been developed at the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies. By bringing together the theoretical and academic building blocks of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies in a didactical format, with special emphasis on the graphic components, ECM aims to support those in search of:
* Understanding and clarifying the conflict episode
* Visibilizing the conflict parties
* Viewing the conflict dynamics at different levels and through different layers&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): Elicitive Conflict Mapping Available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ecm/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;


== Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies ==
In January 2017 the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was inaugurated at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences. The Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies consists of the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies, which is the rooftop for a large number of research and cooperation projects and the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

=== UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies ===
The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies of the University of Innsbruck was established in June 2008 as a consequence of the systematic research on the interpretations of peaces and the unique approach to peace studies as developed by Innsbruck’s MA program for Peace Studies since 2001. The agreement has been signed between the UNESCO, represented by its Director-General Koichiro Matsuura, and the University of Innsbruck, represented by its rector Karlheinz Töchterle.

In the light of the excellent results achieved and confirmed by the positive evaluation of the report on its activities, UNESCO renewed in February 2015 the 2008 agreement concerning the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck until June 2019.

According to the agreement the main purposes of the UNESCO Chair are:
# the promotion of an integrated system of research, training, information and documentation in the field of peace studies;
# the facilitation of collaboration between high-level, internationally recognized researchers and teaching staff of the University and other institutions in Austria, in Europe and North America, and other regions of the world;
# the reinforcement of the existing network of cooperating partners through further regional, as well as international, cooperation;
# the enhancement and complement of the already existing on-line teaching methods;
# the exchange of professors, researchers, and students with other universities within the framework of UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme.

=== The MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Studies ===
Founded in 2002, the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation has become a leading Masters Program, training the next generation of Peace and Conflict Studies scholars and Conflict Workers. In its didactical approach the program follows a relational approach to conflict of elective conflict transformation, which is conveyed to the students in theory and practice. After the successful completion of an MA thesis students are awarded the academic title Master of Arts (120 ECTS Credit Points). The first UNESCO Chairholder Professor Wolfgang Dietrich is the third academic director of the MA Program, following Prof. [[Anton Pelinka]] and Prof. Alan Scott in this function.

=== Unit for Peace Studies Alumni Network ===
Established in 2008, a vast amount of alumni initiatives have emerged within the active network of graduates from the MA Program in Peace and Conflict Studies. Amongst others this includes the Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces, the Many Peaces Magazine, the Peace Fund and the Many Peaces e.V..

==== Many Peaces Festival ====
The Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces is an international peace and conflict studies conference, facilitating a dialogue amongst scholars engaged within the field of transrational peace philosophy, as well as practitioners, within the field of elective conflict transformation. The 1st Innsbruck Academic Festival took place between August 9 and 14 2015 at the Grillhof Seminar Center in Innsbruck, Austria.

==== Many Peaces Magazine====
The Many Peaces Magazine&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.manypeaces.org&lt;/ref&gt; was conceptualized and launched in 2014 by Adham Hamed, Mayme Lefurgey, Paul Lauer and Isabelle Guibert. It was created as an outlet to showcase the work of alumni, students, cooperation partners and friends of the Master of Arts Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation and the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies located at Universität Innsbruck, Austria. The magazine is published twice a year, in January and July of each year. The Many Peaces Magazine team has changed and developed over the past volumes and is currently coordinated by a team spread out over three continents and features authors and stories from around the globe. Many of the articles, stories and contributions that can be found in the magazine relate to the field of Peace Studies in some way, but more specifically to the fields of Transrational Peace Philosophy and Elicitive Conflict Transformation.

'''Kim Young-sam''' ({{korean|hangul=김영삼|hanja=金泳三}}; {{IPA-ko|ki.mjʌŋ.sam}} or {{IPA-ko|kim|}} {{IPA-ko|jʌŋ.sam|}}; 20 December 1927 – 22 November 2015) was a [[South Korea]]n politician and democratic activist, who served as [[President of South Korea]] from 1993 to 1998. From 1961, he spent almost 30 years as one of the leaders of the South Korean opposition, and one of the most powerful rivals to the authoritarian regimes of [[Park Chung-hee]] and [[Chun Doo-hwan]].

Elected president in 1992, Kim became the first civilian to hold the office in over 30 years. He was inaugurated on 25 February 1993, and served a single five-year term, presiding over a massive anti-corruption campaign, the arrest of his two predecessors, and an [[internationalization]] policy called ''Segyehwa''.

==Early life and education==
Kim was born in [[Geoje Island]], by the southeastern tip of the Korean peninsula, to a rich fishing family on 20 December 1927, when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Imperial Japanese rule]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt; He was the eldest of one son and five daughters in his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/kim-young-sam|title=Kim Young Sam Facts|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]], Kim served in the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean military]] as a student soldier (or [[Officer candidate]]). In 1952, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Philosophy]] from [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/21/world/asia/ap-as-skorea-obit-kim.html?_r=0|title=Hospital Official: Ex-SKorean President Kim Young-Sam Dies|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1954, Kim was elected to the [[National Assembly of South Korea]], as a member of the party led by [[Syngman Rhee]], the first president of South Korea.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt; At the time of his election, Kim was the youngest member of the national assembly.&lt;ref name="ABCobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hospital-official-skorean-president-kim-young-sam-dies-35345735|title=Former South Korean President Kim Young-Sam Dies at 87|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after his electoral victory, Kim left his party and joined the opposition when Rhee attempted to amend the [[constitution of South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt; Kim then became a leading critic, along with [[Kim Dae-jung]], of the military governments of [[Park Chung-hee]] and [[Chun Doo-hwan]].

===New Democratic Party leader===
In 1974, he was elected as the president of the [[New Democratic Party (South Korea)|New Democratic Party]]. While he temporarily lost his power within the national assembly in 1976, Kim made a political comeback during the final year of Park Chung-hee's rule. Kim took a hardline policy of never compromising or cooperating with Park's [[Democratic Republican Party (South Korea)|Democratic Republican Party]] until the [[Yushin Constitution]] was repealed and boldly criticized Park's dictatorship, which could be punished with imprisonment under the new constitution.&lt;ref name=breen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breen |first1=Michael |title=Kim Young-sam: the man who would be president |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2014/03/363_96977.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |work=[[The Korea Times]] |date=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122124301/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2014/03/363_96977.html |archivedate=22 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1979, Kim allowed around 200 female workers at the Y.H. Trading Company to use the headquarters of New Democratic Party as a place for their sit-in demonstration and pledged to protect them. One thousand policemen raided the party headquarters and arrested the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kenneth B.|title=Korea and East Asia: The Story of a Phoenix|date=1997|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=027595823X|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; One female worker died in the process and many lawmakers trying to protect them were severely beaten, some requiring hospitalization. The [[Minjung#YH Company protest|YH Incident]] garnered widespread criticism and led to Kim's condemnation, with an assertion that Park's dictatorship would soon collapse.&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fowler|first1=James|title=The United States and South Korean Democratization|journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]]|date=June 1999|volume=114|issue=2|pages=265–288|doi=10.2307/2657739|url=http://fowler.ucsd.edu/south_korea.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident, Park was determined to remove Kim from the political scene, like the imprisoned Kim Dae-jung, and instructed the [[Korean Central Intelligence Agency|South Korean Central Intelligence Agency]] (KCIA) to engineer such a move. In September 1979, a court order suspended Kim's presidency of the New Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=breen2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Ezra F.|last2=Kim|first2=Byung-Kook|title=The Park Chung Hee Era: The Transformation of South Korea|date=2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0674058208|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kim called on the United States to stop supporting Park's dictatorship in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=breen2/&gt;&lt;ref name=seth&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seth|first1=Michael J.|title=A Concise History of Modern Korea: From the Late Nineteenth Century to the Present|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|isbn=0742567133|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park wanted to have Kim imprisoned while the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]], concerned over increasing human right violations, issued a strong warning not to persecute members of the opposition party. When Kim was expelled from the National Assembly in October 1979, the United States recalled its ambassador back to [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; and all 66 lawmakers of the New Democratic Party resigned from the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=seth/&gt;

When it became known that the South Korean government was planning to accept the resignations selectively, uprisings broke out in Kim's hometown of [[Busan|Pusan]]. It was the biggest demonstration since the Syngman Rhee presidency, and spread to nearby [[Masan]] and other cities, with students and citizens calling for an end to the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; The crisis was one of the causes for [[Park Chung-hee assassination|the assassination of Park Chung-hee]] on 26 October 1979 by KCIA Director [[Kim Jae-gyu]].&lt;ref name=breen2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breen |first1=Michael |title=Inner circle collapses: Kim Jae-gyu and Cha Ji-cheol |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2015/11/363_104936.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |work=[[The Korea Times]] |date=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122130235/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2015/11/363_104936.html |archivedate=22 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House arrest===
The government's oppressive stance towards the opposition continued under Chun Doo-hwan, who seized power with a military coup on 12 December 1979.  Kim Young-Sam was expelled from the National Assembly for his democratic activities and banned from politics from 1980 to 1985. In 1983, he undertook a 21-day hunger strike protesting the dictatorship of [[Chun Doo-hwan]].&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|title=Former President Kim Young-sam dies at age 87|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151122000004|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed presidential run, 1987===
When the [[South Korean presidential election, 1987|first democratic presidential election was held in 1987]] after Chun's retirement, Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung ran against each other, splitting the opposition vote and enabling ex-general [[Roh Tae-woo]], Chun's hand-picked successor, to win the election. This was also despite support from the first female presidential candidate, [[Hong Sook-ja]], who resigned her candidacy in order to support Kim.&lt;ref name="LosAngeles2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holley|first1=David|title=Kim Young Sam Gets Backing of Only Woman in Korea Race|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-06/news/mn-27127_1_kim-young-sam|date=6 December 1987|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he unexpectedly merged his Democratic Reunification Party with Roh's ruling [[Democratic Justice Party]] to form the [[New Korea Party|Democratic Liberal Party]], now the [[Liberty Korea Party]].&lt;ref name=breen/&gt;

===Presidency (1993–98)===
As the candidate of the governing party,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt; he defeated Kim Dae-jung in the [[South Korean presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]]. He was only the third civilian to hold the office, and the first since 1962.

The Kim Young-sam administration attempted to reform the government and the economy. One of the first acts of his government was to start an anti-corruption campaign, which began at the very top, as Kim promised not to use political [[slush funds]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt;

Kim's government required government and military officials to publish their financial records, precipitating the resignation of several high-ranking officers and cabinet members.&lt;ref name=kihl/&gt; He had his two predecessors as president, Chun and Roh, arrested and indicted on charges of corruption and treason for their role in military coups, although they would be pardoned near the end of his term.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt; Kim also granted amnesty to thousands of political prisoners, and removed the criminal convictions of pro-democracy protesters who had been arrested during the [[Gwangju massacre]] in the aftermath of the [[Coup d'état of December Twelfth]].&lt;ref name=kihl/&gt; The anti-corruption campaign was also part of an attempt to reform the ''[[chaebol]]'', the large South Korean conglomerates which dominated the economy.  However, Kim's anti-corruption message was damaged after his son was arrested for bribery and tax evasion related to the [[Hanbo scandal]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt;

In 1994, when American president [[Bill Clinton]] mulled over attacking [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center|Nyongbyon]], the centre of [[North Korean nuclear program|North Korea's nuclear program]], Kim advised him to back down to prevent renewal of fighting.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt;

Kim's new ministerial party, the DLP lost its narrow majority in the National Assembly in 1996. [[Kia Motors]] collapsed soon thereafter, setting off a chain of events which embroiled South Korea in the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] during the last year of his presidency.&lt;ref name=kihl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kihl|first1=Young Whan|title=Transforming Korean Politics: Democracy, Reform, and Culture|date=2005|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk|isbn=0765614286|pages=102–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the financial crisis, the collapse of Kia and other conglomerates led Kim to accept a $58 billion USD bailout from the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
After his presidency, Kim travelled the world promoting democracy, and speaking at events such as ''Towards a Global Forum on New Democracies'' in [[Taiwan]] in January 2007.&lt;ref name="Chiobit"/&gt;

He died in [[Seoul National University Hospital]] on 22 November 2015, from [[heart failure]], at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg obit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/kim-young-sam-south-korean-president-ended-years-of-military-rule/article27446059/ | title=Kim Young Sam: South Korean president ended years of military rule | publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate=26 November 2015 | author=Kim, Hyung-Jin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="State funeral - AP" /&gt; On 26 November 2015, a televised state funeral was held for Kim at the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] lawn, during which Prime Minister [[Hwang Kyo-ahn]] delivered the opening remarks.&lt;ref name="State funeral - AP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c236ea7ace424a20953bd5985ebf59d4/s-koreans-mourn-ex-president-kim-state-funeral | title=S.

==Personal life==
Kim was a member of the Chunghyun [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] and was fluent in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and his native language, [[Korean language|Korean]].

{{For|the computer science concept|Lazy evaluation}}
[[File:British_club_scene.jpg|thumb|300px|''Scene in club lounge'', by [[Thomas Rowlandson]] ]]
 
'''Laziness''' (also known as '''indolence''') is disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to act or 
exert oneself. It is often used as a pejorative; terms for a person seen to be lazy
include [[Sedentary lifestyle|couch potato]], [[slacker]], and [[wikt:bludger|bludger]].

Despite [[Sigmund Freud]]'s discussion of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], [[Leonard Carmichael]] notes that "laziness is not a word that appears in the table of contents of most technical books on [[psychology]]... It is a guilty secret of modern psychology that more is understood about the [[motivation]] of thirsty [[rat]]s and hungry pecking [[pigeon]]s as they press levers than about the way in which [[poet]]s make themselves write poems or [[scientist]]s force themselves into the laboratory when the good [[golf]]ing days of spring arrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Laziness and the Scholarly Life|author=Leonard Carmichael|publisher=The Scientific Monthly|volume=78|number=4|date=Apr 1954|pages=208–213|jstor=21392}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1931 survey found that [[high school]] students were more likely to attribute their failing performance to laziness, while teachers ranked "lack of ability" as the major cause, with laziness coming in second.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=High-School Students' Opinions on Reasons for Failure in High-School Subjects|author=Harry Howard Gilbert|publisher=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=23|number=1|date=Jan 1931|pages=46–49|jstor=27525294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laziness is not to be confused with [[avolition]], a negative symptom of certain mental health issues such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], [[sleep disorders]], and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/schizophrenia/index.shtml|title=NIMH · Schizophrenia|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/adhd.10.1.6.20567?journalCode=adhd==Religious views==&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Laziness is a habit rather than a mental health issue. It may reflect a lack of self-esteem, a lack of positive recognition by others, a lack of discipline stemming from low self-confidence, or a lack of interest in the activity or belief in its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/200806/laziness-fact-or-fiction|title=Laziness: Fact or Fiction?|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laziness may manifest as procrastination or vacillation. Studies of [[motivation]] suggest that laziness may be caused by a decreased level of motivation, which in turn can be caused by over-stimulation or excessive impulses or distractions. These increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for reward and pleasure. The more dopamine that is released, the greater intolerance one has for valuing and accepting  productive and rewarding action.&lt;ref&gt;Wemesfelder, F.&lt;/ref&gt; This desensitization leads to dulling of the neural patterns and affects negatively the anterior insula of the brain responsible for risk perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/20026-brain-dopamine-worker-slacker.html|title=Brain Chemicals Predict Laziness - Risk, Reward &amp; Hard Work|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ADHD]] specialists say engaging in multiple activities can cause behavioral problems such as attention/focus failure or perfectionism and subsequently pessimism. In these circumstances laziness can manifest as a negative coping mechanism (aversion), the desire to avoid certain situations in the hopes of countering certain experiences and preconceived ill results.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, University of Calgary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lacanianism|Lacanian]] thought says laziness is the "acting out" of [[archetype]]s from societal programming and negative child rearing practices. Boredom is sometimes conflated with laziness; one study shows that the average Briton is bored 6 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;triviala.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Goetz, University of Konstanz, Germany, and John Eastwood, York University, Canada, concur that aversive states such as laziness can be equally adaptive for making [[Change management#Approach|change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilUaGnloq_8|title=Who Moved My Cheese [Original] - Spencer Johnson|first=|last=theotomji|date=23 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toxic if allowed to fester. An outlook found to be helpful in their studies is "being mindful and not looking for ways out of it, simultaneously to be also open to creative and active options if they should arise." They point out that a relentless engaging in activities without breaks can cause oscillations of failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg|title=Two Monkeys Were Paid Unequally: Excerpt from Frans de Waal's TED Talk|first=|last=TED Blog Video|date=4 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may result in mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Motivation and Emotion, Vol. 38&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been shown that laziness can render one apathetic to reactant mental health issues such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]], [[Schizoid personality disorder|indifference]], [[substance abuse]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

==Economics==
{{See also|Protestant work ethic|Achievement ideology}}

[[Economist]]s have differing views of laziness. [[Frédéric Bastiat]] argues that idleness is the result of people focusing on the pleasant immediate effects of their actions rather than potentially negative long-term consequences. Others note that humans seem to have a tendency to seek after leisure. Hal Cranmer writes, "For all these arguments against laziness, it is amazing we work so hard to achieve it. Even those hard-working Puritans were willing to break their backs every day in exchange for an eternity of lying around on a cloud and playing the harp. Every industry is trying to do its part to give its customers more leisure time."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/daily/928|author=Cranmer, Hal|title=In Defense of Laziness|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|date=April 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Mises]] writes, "The expenditure of labor is deemed painful. Not to work is considered a state of affairs more satisfactory than working. Leisure is, other things being equal, preferred to travail (work). People work only when they value the return of labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought about by the curtailment of leisure. To work involves [[disutility]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/humanaction/chap7sec3.asp|year=1949|chapter=Action Within the World|title=Human Action|author=von Mises, Ludwig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary==
Laziness in American literature is figured as a fundamental problem with social and spiritual consequences. In 1612 John Smith in his "Map to Virginia" is seen using a jeremiad to address idleness. In the 1750s this sort of advocating reached at its apex in literature's. David Bertelson in "The Lazy South" (1767) expressed this as a substitution of "spiritual industry" over "patriotic industry". Writers like William Byrd went to a great extent and censured North Carolina as land of lubbers. Thomas Jefferson in his "Notes on the State of Virginia" (1785) acknowledges a small portion of the people have only seen labor and identifies the cause of this indolence to the rise of "slave-holding" society. Jefferson raised his concerns what this deleterious system will bring to the economic system. Later by the 1800s the rise of Romanticism changed attitudes of the society, values of work were re-written; stigmatization of idleness was overthrown with glamorous notions. [[John P. Kennedy|John Pendleton Kennedy]] was a prominent writer in romanticizing sloth and slavery, In Swallow Barn (1832) he equated idleness and its flow as living in oneness with nature. Mark Twain in "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (1885) contrasts realist and romantic perspective of "laziness" and calls attention to the essential convention of aimlessness and transcendence that connects the character. In 20th century the poor whites were portrayed in the grotesque caricatures of early southern laziness. In Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood (1952) and Good Country People (1955) depicts spiritual backwardness as the cause for disinclination to work. Lacking in any social function which was termed equally with luxurious lifestyle was closely portrayed through lives of displaced aristocrats and their indolence. Jason Compson, Robert Penn Warren, William Styron were some of the writers who explored this perspective. The lack of meaningful work was defined as a void which aristocrats needed to fill with pompous culture, [[Walker Percy]] is a writer who have thoroughly mined on the subject. Percy's characters often exposes to the emptiness (spiritual sloth) of contemporary life and come to rectify it with renewed resources of spiritual resources.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Flora et. al. (2002). ''The Companion to Southern Literature: Themes, Genres, Places, People, Movements, and Motifs'', p. 420 - 423. LSU Press. {{ISBN|9780807126929}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Christianity===
{{Main|Sloth (deadly sin)}}
One of the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[seven deadly sins]] is [[sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]], which is often defined as spiritual and/or physical [[apathy]] or laziness. Sloth is discouraged in ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:12}}), [[2 Thessalonians]], and associated with wickedness in one of the [[parables of Jesus]] in the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' ({{bibleverse||Matthew|25:26}}).  In the [[wisdom literature|Wisdom books]] of ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' and ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'', it is stated that laziness can lead to [[poverty]]  ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|10:4}}, {{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|10:18}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2015/01/31/top-7-bible-verses-about-laziness/|title=Top 7 Bible Verses About Laziness|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbible.info/topics/laziness|title=What Does the Bible Say About Laziness?|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Binsfeld]]'s ''Binsfeld's Classification of Demons'', [[Belphegor]] is thought to be its chief demon.&lt;ref name=belphegor/&gt;

===Islam===
The Arabic term used in the [[Quran]] for laziness, inactivity and sluggishness is كَسَل (''kasal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=ksl|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Quran Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of laziness is [[Jihad#Sunni|Jihad al-Nafs]], i.e. the struggle against the self, against one’s own ego. Among the [[five pillars of Islam]], [[salat|praying five times a day]] and [[sawm|fasting during Ramaḍān]] are part of actions against laziness.

===Buddhism===
{{main|Kausīdya}}
In Buddhism, the term ''[[kausīdya]]'' is commonly translated as "laziness" or "spiritual sloth". ''Kausīdya'' is defined as clinging to unwholesome activities such as lying down and stretching out, procrastinating, and not being enthusiastic about or engaging in virtuous activity.

== In selected societies==
From 1909 to 1915, the [[Rockefeller]] Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease sought to eradicate [[hookworm]] infestation from 11 [[southern U.S.]] states. Hookworms were popularly known as "the germ of laziness" because they produced listlessness and weakness in the people they infested. Hookworms infested 40 percent of southerners and were identified in the North as the cause of the South's alleged backwardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The War against Hookworm|author=Ronald L. Numbers|publisher=Science, New Series|volume=215|number=4530|date=Jan 15, 1982|pages=280–281|jstor=1688243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged{{By whom|date=March 2013}} that indolence was the reason for backward conditions in [[Indonesia]], such as the failure to implement [[Green Revolution]] agricultural methods. But a counter-argument is that the Indonesians, living very precariously, sought to play it safe by not risking a failed crop, given that not all experiments introduced by outsiders had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The "Ethic of Indolence": Another View|author1=Karen A. Laidlaw |author2=Ronald E. Seavoy |publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=10|number=1|date=March 1979|pages=190–193|jstor=20070277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
It is common for animals (even those like [[hummingbird]]s that have high energy needs) to forage for food until satiated, and then spend most of their time doing nothing, or at least nothing in particular. They seek to "[[satisfice]]" their needs rather than obtaining an optimal diet or habitat. Even [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals, which have a limited amount of daylight in which to accomplish their tasks, follow this pattern. Social activity comes in a distant third to eating and resting for foraging animals. When more time must be spent foraging, animals are more likely to sacrifice time spent on aggressive behavior than time spent resting. Extremely efficient [[predator]]s have more free time and thus often appear more lazy than relatively inept predators that have little free time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|jstor=4216378|title=Time Resources and Laziness in Animals|author=Joan M. Herbers|publisher=Oecologia|volume=49|number=2|year=1981|pages=252–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beetle]]s likewise seem to forage lazily due to a lack of foraging competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Laziness" and Hypothermia as a Foraging Strategy in Flower Scarabs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)|author1=Bernd Heinrich |author2=Elizabeth Mcclain |publisher=Physiological Zoology|volume=59|number=2|date=Mar–Apr 1986|pages=273–282|jstor=30156041}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some animals, such as [[pigeon]]s and [[rat]]s, seem to prefer to respond for food rather than eat equally available "free food" in some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pitfalls of Organismic Concepts: "Learned Laziness"?|author1=Elkan R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8230">Lean CFP (Complex Flow Production) Driven is a new approach which takes into account not only the widely implemented [[Lean manufacturing]], but combines the principles of Lean with the Operating Curve, an approach based on the theoretical approach of  [[Queuing Theory]] developed in academia in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity"&gt;Aurand S. Steven, Miller J. Peter; The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity; IEEE, USA, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Lean CFP Driven is to eliminate waste in order to achieve higher quality, increase productivity and at the same time understand the relationship between utilization, lead time and variability in order to maximize performance within the [[semiconductor]] industry.

==Lean CFP Driven – Lean Complex Flow Production Driven==

===Background Semiconductor industry===
The semiconductor industry is one of the most productive and dynamic industries in the world. It faces a continuous and rapid advancement in technology which puts the companies under constant pressure to come up with superior and cheaper goods than those that were state-of-the-art only a few months ago.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;Investopedia; http://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/semiconductor.asp#axzz1vbOvyLAZ; 02.07.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The market and development of the market is based on [[Moore's Law]] or More than Moore.&lt;ref name="ieee spectrum"&gt;ieee spectrum; http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-meets-its-match; 01.07.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer demand in the semiconductor market evolves and changes at a swift pace which leads to the fact that a high level of flexibility is necessary to serve and meet the requirements of the customers.&lt;ref name="Mastering variability in complex environments"&gt;Bauer H, Kouris I, Schlögl G, Sigrist T, Veira J, Wee D; Mastering variability in complex environments; McKinsey &amp; Company, 2011 .&lt;/ref&gt; The semiconductor industry is furthermore very capital intensive based on the fact that the production equipment is highly complex, specialized and thus incredibly expensive.&lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt; Challenges that the industry is facing are to continuously improve yield performance, achieve the highest possible return on the expensive equipment, speed and zero defects.&lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt;

===Lean CFP Driven and Traditional Lean===
Lean CFP Driven moves in a new direction from the traditional Lean because of the additional focus on utilization, cycle time and variability. The different characteristics of the semiconductor industry, e.g. production structure and production related costs compared to other industries, forms the need to approach the Lean philosophy in a new way in order to meet these specific characteristics.

There are five key characteristics for the semiconductor industry:
*	Long cycle time.&lt;ref name="Enabling Timely Revolutions in the Performance of Multi-Product Fabs"&gt;Weber C, Fayed A; Enabling Timely Revolutions in the Performance of Multi-Product Fabs, Portland State University, Austin Texas, USA, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*	No parallel process possible, high complexity&lt;ref name="Evaluation of modeling, simulation and optimization approaches for work flow management in semiconductor manufacturing"&gt;Kohn R, Noack D, Mosinski M, Zhou Z, Rose O; Evaluation of modeling, simulation and optimization approaches for work flow management in semiconductor manufacturing; Institute of Applied Computer Science; Dresden Germany; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Short product life cycle.
*	Capital intensive production&lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt;
*	Drastic cost decrease over time

The complex production flow of a semiconductor fab is due to what is called a reentrance flow. A reentrant flow is a well-known attribute within a wafer fab and refers to the wafer visiting each tool not only once, but maybe 20 times during the course through the fab. To duplicate the expensive equipment and create a linear flow would make it even more challenging to get the highest possible return on the equipment and reach an optimized utilization of each tool, even though it results in a very complex production.&lt;ref name="FabTime Cycle Time Management Newsletter – Volume 13, Number 3"&gt;FabTime Cycle Time Management Newsletter – Volume 13, Number 3, 2012 by FabTime Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reentrant flow does require a certain level of flexibility, which in terms of Lean, could be seen as [[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] (Waste). The necessary flexibility, also in order to meet fluctuations in customer demand, requires the companies to apply other tools to measure and forecast performance&lt;ref name="Mastering variability in complex environments" /&gt; and this is what Lean CFP Driven provides to the Semiconductor Industry. Lean CFP Driven adds the '''Operating Curve''' to evaluate the factors ''utilization'', ''cycle time'' and ''variability'' which cannot be done through implementation of Traditional Lean.

Typical tools within the Traditional Lean which are also included in the new approach of Lean CFP Driven are as follows:
* [[Poka-Yoke]]
* Visual Management
* [[Value Stream Mapping]]
* [[Kanban]]
* [[Just-in-time (business)|JIT]]
* [[5S (methodology)|5S]]
* [[5 Whys]]

What distinguishes Lean CFP Driven from the traditional approach of Lean in terms of tools is that the new approach applies the tool Operating Curve in addition to the tools listed above. An example of how the Operating Curve could look like is shown in the figure below. The optimal operating point is indicated for different variabilities describing the non-uniformity of the production, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The great advantage of adding the Operating Curve tool is to maximize performance by optimizing both utilization and speed at the same time for the complex industry of Semiconductors by reducing the variability via the 4-partner method.

[[Image:Operating curve.jpg|thumb|none|Operating Curve]]

The Operating Curve is a tool initially developed in academia in the 1970s, based on the Queuing Theory, which uses the indicators Cycle Time and Utilization to benchmark and forecast a manufacturing line’s performance.&lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt; The Operating Curve can be applied for different reasons, for example:

* Understanding the relationship between variability, cycle time and utilization&lt;ref name="Mastering variability in complex environments" /&gt;
* Quantify trade-off between cycle time and utilization &lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt;
* Documenting a single factory’s performance over time &lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt;
* Calculate and Measure line performance &lt;ref name="The Operating Curve: A Method to Measure and benchmark manufacturing line productivity" /&gt;

The Operating curve can be described by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;FF=\alpha\frac{UU_m}{1-UU_m}+1&lt;/math&gt;

where :
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;FF&lt;/math&gt;  || Flow Factor ranging from 0 - ∞
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;|| Variability describing the non-uniformity of the production (low α indicates good performance). Alpha ranges from 0-1
|-
| &lt;math&gt;UU_m&lt;/math&gt;|| Utilization, ranging from 0-100%
|}

The flow factor can also be described as:

&lt;math&gt;FF= \frac{CT}{RPT}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br /&gt;
{|
|-
| '''CT'''|| The line’s actual cycle time
|-
| '''RPT'''|| The theoretical minimum amount of time that a lot (production unit) would need to move from beginning to end (i.e. without queuing or process inefficiencies)
|-
| '''CT''' || = WIP/GR
|-
| '''WIP'''|| Average Work in Process (including all products, also lots on hold)
|-
| '''RPT''' || Maximum number of units to be processed each day
|-
| '''UUm'''  ||= GR/CapaPU 
|-
| '''CapaPU'''|| Capacity of the production unit
|}

{{Terrorism}}
'''Left-wing terrorism''' (sometimes called '''Marxist–Leninist terrorism''' or '''revolutionary/left-wing terrorism''') is [[terrorism]] meant to overthrow conservative or [[capitalism|capitalist systems]] and replace them with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], [[socialist state|socialist]], or [[anarchist]] societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"&gt;Aubrey, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"&gt;Moghadam, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; It has taken vivid manifestations across the world and presented diverging dynamics and relationships with national governments and political economies.

==Ideology==
Left-wing terrorists have been influenced by various communist and socialist currents, including Marxism.&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"/&gt; [[Narodnaya Volya]], a 19th-century terrorist group that killed tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1881&lt;ref name="Czar trial"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Trial of the Czar's Assassins |newspaper=Wanganui Herald |volume=XV |issue=4132|date=7 May 1881 |page=2 |agency=[[United Press Association]] |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WH18810507.2.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed the concept of [[propaganda by the deed]], is a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Moghadam, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sarah Brockhoff]], [[Tim Krieger]] and [[Daniel Meierrieks]], while left-wing terrorism is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist terrorism is ethnically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the revolutionary goal of left-wing terrorism is non-negotiable, whereas nationalist terrorists are willing to make concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggest that rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for [[national liberation]] groups employing terrorism, such as [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the South American [[Tupamaros]], seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"/&gt; Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Left-wing terrorism has its roots in 19th and early 20th century [[anarchist terrorism]] and became pronounced during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern left-wing terrorism developed in the context of the [[Protests of 1968|political unrest of 1968]].  In Western Europe, notable groups included the West German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), the Italian [[Red Brigades]], the French [[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]] (AD), and the Belgian [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC). Asian groups have included the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], although the latter organization later adopted [[nationalist terrorism]].  In Latin America, groups that became actively involved in terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s included the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]], the Peruvian [[Shining Path]], and the Colombian [[19th of April Movement]].&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Front de libération du Québec]] was a Marxist-Leninist group active in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, promoting socialist insurrection and an independent Quebec. They are known for over 160 bombings and other violent incidents that killed eight, and for the kidnap-murder of Quebec politician [[Pierre Laporte]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Pelletier. The October crisis. McClelland and Stewart, 1971. Pp. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Terrorism in the United States}}
Modern left-wing terrorist groups in the United States developed from remnants of the [[Weather Underground]] and extremist elements of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. Between 1973 and 1975, the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] was active, committing bank robberies, [[murder]]s, and other acts of violence. Most notably, the group kidnapped heiress [[Patty Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/index.html|title=American Experience {{!}} Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, both the [[May 19th Communist Organization]] (M19CO) and the smaller [[United Freedom Front]] were active. A 1994 study found that in the 1980s "the actual number of acts of terrorism committed by left-wing groups accounted for about three-fourths of all officially designated acts of domestic terrorism in America. About half of these leftist acts were committed by Puerto Rican groups, while the rest were committed by traditional leftist terrorist groups like M19CO".&lt;ref&gt;Brent L. Smith (1994). "[https://archive.org/details/Terrorism_in_America_Brent_Smith Terrorism in America]", accessed 18 April 2018&lt;/REF&gt; After 1985, following the dismantling of both groups, one source reports there were no confirmed acts of left-wing terrorism by similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of left-wing terrorism dropped off at the end of the Cold War (circa 1989), partly due to the loss of support for communism.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 13, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey describes the [[Sandinistas]], [[Shining Path]], [[19th of April Movement]], and [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) as the main organizations involved in left-wing terrorism in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. These organizations opposed the United States government and drew local support, as well as receiving support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

====FARC====
The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) is a Marxist–Leninist organization in Colombia which has engaged in vehicle bombings, gas cylinder bombs, killings, landmines, kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, as well as guerilla and conventional military. The United States Department of State includes the FARC-EP on its list of foreign terrorist organizations, as does the European Union. It funds itself primarily through extortion, kidnapping and their participation in the [[illegal drug trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]. "Colombia's Most Powerful Rebels."  September 19, 2003.

Businesses operating in rural areas, including agricultural, oil, and mining interests, were required to pay "vaccines" (monthly payments) which "protected" them from subsequent attacks and kidnappings. An additional, albeit less lucrative, source of revenue was highway blockades in which guerrillas stopped motorists and buses in order to confiscate jewelry and money. An estimated 20 to 30 percent of FARC combatants are under 18 years old, with many as young as 12 years old, for a total of around 5000 children.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]].

==== Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ====
The [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] has been responsible for hundreds of attacks on government and civilian targets.
After the [[United People's Front of Nepal]] (UPF)'s Maoist wing, CPN-M, performed poorly in elections and was excluded from the 194 election, the Maoists turned to [[insurgency]]. They aimed to overthrow Nepal's monarchy and parliamentary democracy, and to change Nepalese society, including a purge of the nation's elite class, a state takeover of private industry, and collectivization of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3531 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/nepal/terroristoutfits/index.html Nepal Terrorist Groups - Maoist Insurgents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], attacks against civilian populations occurred as part of Maoist strategy, leading [[Amnesty International]] to state: &lt;blockquote&gt;The CPN (Maoist) has consistently targeted private schools, which it ideologically opposes. On the 14 April 2005 the CPN (Maoist) demanded that all private schools shut down, although this demand was withdrawn on 28 April. Following this demand, it bombed two schools in western Nepal on 15 April, a school in Nepalganj, Banke district on 17 April and a school in Kalyanpur, Chitwan on 21 April. CPN (Maoist) cadres also reportedly threw a bomb at students taking classes in a school in Khara, Rukum district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107070737/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA310542005?

==== Japanese Red Army ====
The [[Japanese Red Army]] (JRA) was founded in 1969 as the "Red Army Faction" by students impatient with the Communist Party.  In 1970, they hijacked a plane to North Korea, where nine of their members were interned. Fourteen members were killed during an internal purge. In 1971, the renamed JRA formed a connection with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and established a base in Lebanon. Their major terrorist acts included an armed attack on the Tel Aviv airport, highjacking planes to Libya and Bangladesh, kidnapping the French ambassador to the Hague, and bombing a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) nightclub in Naples, Italy. By the mid-1990s, their level of activity had declined and the US State Department no longer considered them a terrorist threat. In 2001, their leader announced the dissolution of the group, although some of its members were in prison and others were still wanted by police.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attempts to avoid loss of life, there were casualties as a result of these attacks. After Carette and other members were arrested in 1985, the group ceased to be operational. Carette served 17 years of a life sentence, although his colleagues that were convicted with him were released earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

'''''Making Europe Unconquerable''''' is a book about how [[civilian-based defense]] can be incorporated into the foundations of European defense and collective security. Written by [[Gene Sharp]], the book was originally published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. Its subtitle was ''the potential of civilian-based deterrence and defense''. The book was reviewed in major newspapers,&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer86/&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name=taylor87/&gt; and professional journals.&lt;ref name=pierre86/&gt;&lt;ref name=harbottle8687/&gt;&lt;ref name=thee86/&gt; Although it advocated a significant departure from existing defense policies, it received a favorable review from [[George F. Kennan]], widely perceived as one of the major architects of the US approach to the [[cold war]]. Later in the same year, the book was republished with a foreword from [[George F. Kennan|Kennan]]. It has also been published in Dutch and Italian editions.

==Topics covered==
In its opening pages, ''Making Europe Unconquerable'' states that 
{{Quote | This book is mostly about... ‘[[Civilian-based defense|civilian-based defence]]’... In this policy, the whole population and the society's institutions become the fighting forces.  Their weaponry consists of a vast variety of forms of psychological, economic, social, and political resistance and counter-attack...  to deny the attackers their objectives and to make consolidation of political control impossible. These aims would be achieved by applying massive  and selective noncooperation and defiance [and seeking] to create maximum international problems for the attackers and to subvert the reliability of their troops and functionaires. | pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3}}
''Making Europe Unconquerable'' contains 7 chapters entitled
# Meeting Europe's defense needs
# [[Civilian-based defense]] for Western Europe?
# [[Transarmament]]
# Preventing attack
# In face of attack
# Defeating attack
# Assessing the potential
The book also contains a bibliography (12 pages) and an index (24 pages).

{{Gene Sharp}}In the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[George F. Kennan]], widely viewed as a major architect of the US approach to the [[cold war]], wrote that Sharp's "primary purpose in writing the book was... 'to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.' And for this, he makes a reasonably good case."&lt;ref name= kennan86 /&gt; Kennan stated that "the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it." Kennan viewed Sharp's approach as requiring
{{Quote | a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, ‘a crucial insight into the nature of power’—namely, that ‘all political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight’&lt;ref name=kennan86 /&gt;}}
Kennan wondered "whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so,"&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt; and advised that Sharp
{{Quote | must not expect... that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going...  It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;}}

In the ''New York Times'', [[Karl E. Meyer]] described the book as "reflective," and stated that  "there is considerable merit to &lt;nowiki&gt;[Sharp's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; contention that 'all peoples can with effort make themselves politically indigestable to would-be tyrants.'"&lt;ref name= meyer86/&gt; Meyer also argued that Sharp's approach "has its flaws...  If the stakes are deemed sufficiently vital, civilian resistance seems unlikely to dissuade a determined aggressor."&lt;ref name= meyer86 /&gt;

In ''Foreign Affairs'', Andrew Pierre wrote that 
{{Quote | The value of this thoughtful work is in the alternative it suggests: ‘civilian defense’ through advance training for such actions against an intruder as mass public demonstrations, boycotts and strikes, demoralization of enemy troops, and the like. | pp. 872–73&lt;ref name= pierre86 /&gt;}}
He added that "The author's proposals go against the grain of mainstream thinking, and to this reviewer leave many questions unanswered, but they are carefully put forward in a nonpolemical manner and clearly merit sustained attention and thought" (p.&amp;nbsp;873&lt;ref name=pierre86 /&gt;).

''[[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]]'', himself a former designer of nuclear weapons, reviewed the book in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''. He quoted Einstein:
{{Quote | ‘The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.’  Although Albert Einstein's admonition has been quoted innumerable times, it has not, with few exceptions, led to deep and persistent thought about alternatives...  One of these exceptions is in the writings of Gene Sharp about what he calls ‘civilian-based defense’...  Making Europe Unconquerable is especially timely. (p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;}}
He added that "The side effects of pursuing a civilian-based defense strategy are especially interesting, since they tend to be beneficial in peacetime. This is a book that should be read attentively by anyone seriously searching for new ways of thinking about how we can stop our "drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." (p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">{{further|Classical conditioning}}
In [[experimental psychology]] the term ''[[conditioned emotional response]]'' refers to a phenomenon that is seen in [[classical conditioning]] after a conditioned stimulus (CS) has been paired with an emotion-producing unconditioned stimulus (US) such as electric shock. The conditioned emotional response is usually measured through its effect in suppressing an ongoing response.  For example, a rat first learns to press a lever through [[operant conditioning]]. Classical conditioning follows: in a series of trials the rat is exposed to a CS, often a light or a noise. Each CS is followed by the US, an electric shock. As an association between the CS and US develops, the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The slower the rat presses, the stronger its conditioned emotional response, or "fear." 

Researchers working on theories of conditioning often use the conditioned emotional response to measure the strength of the association between CS and US. They use the ''suppression ratio'' to quantify this strength.

The '''suppression ratio''' equals the number of responses made during a CS divided by the number of responses made during the CS plus the number of responses made during a period just before the CS that has the same duration as the CS:

&lt;math&gt;SR = D / (D+B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Where SR = suppression Ratio, D = responding during CS and B = responding before CS.

*If SR = 0,  there were no responses during the CS and conditioning is strong.
*If SR = 1/2, the response rate did not change when the CS was presented and there is no evidence of conditioning
*It would be unusual for SR to be greater than 1/2. This would mean the subject responded faster during the CS than before; this could happen if the US were something positive, like food, instead of shock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21010">{{Mindfulness}}

'''Mindfulness and technology''' is a movement in research and design, that encourages the user to become aware of the present moment, rather than losing oneself in a technological device. This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion. [[Mindfulness]] stems from Buddhist [[meditation]] practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. In the field of [[Human–computer interaction|Human-Computer Interaction]], research is being done on ''Techno-spirituality'' — the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Elizabeth A.

== Mindfulness Theory ==
In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress Reduction|url = http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress-reduction/|website = University of Massachusetts Medical School|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture. The program uses combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and [[yoga]]. These practices were derived from teachings of the [[Eastern world|Eastern World]], specifically Buddhist traditions. Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental health-related quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in spirituality partly explain health-related quality of life outcomes after Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction|journal = Journal of behavioral medicine|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 0160-7715|pmc = 3151546|pmid = 21360283|pages = 508–518|volume = 34|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s10865-011-9332-x|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Greeson|first2 = Daniel M.|last2 = Webber|first3 = Moria J.|last3 = Smoski|first4 = Jeffrey G.|last4 = Brantley|first5 = Andrew G.|last5 = Ekblad|first6 = Edward C.|last6 = Suarez|first7 = Ruth Quillian|last7 = Wolever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Software===
There are applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment.

====Mindfulness Bell====
According to Vietnamese Zen teacher [[Thích Nhất Hạnh|Thich Nhat Hanh]], the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness Software {{!}} Plum Village|url = http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/mindfulness-software/|website = plumvillage.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body. The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device.

====Meditation====

A 2011 brain imaging study published in the ''Journal of Neuroscience'' found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 8 Best Meditation Apps For Unwinding -- On The Go!|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/meditation-apps-inner-peace_n_2900544.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as [[Headspace (digital health platform)|Headspace]], [[Insight Timer]] and Buddhify.

===Wearables===
There are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body.

Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the "Virtual Meditative Walk" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Gromala, Xin Tong, Amber Choo, Mehdi Karamnejad, and Chris D. Shaw. 2015.

==Techno-spirituality==
Intel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion. Techno-spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion. This area is in high demand and “important under-explored areas of HCI research”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spirituality: There's an App for That!

Inspired by Bell’s work, researchers (Sterling &amp; Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of “the here and the now”. They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shared Moments: Opportunities for Mobile Phones in Religious Participation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1389908.1389928|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Designing for User eXperiences|date = 2007-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-60558-308-2|pages = 15:2–15:7|series = DUX '07|doi = 10.1145/1389908.1389928|first = Rhiannon|last = Sterling|first2 = John|last2 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction Design==

===Slow Design===

[[Slow design]] is  a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Mindful Design===
[[Design for behaviour change|Mindful design]], based on [[Ellen Langer|Langer]]’s theory of mindfulness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mindfulness|last = Langer|first = E.J|publisher = Addison Wesley Publishing Company.|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Counterclockwise|last = Langer|first = E.J.|publisher = Hodder and Stoughton.|year = |isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design.  A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://niedderer.org/1961-1b.pdf|title = Mindful Design as a Driver for Social Behaviour Change.|last = Niedderer|first = K.|date = 2013|journal = Consilience and Innovation in Design - Proceedings of the 5th International IASDR|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability. Other approaches include crime prevention or health.  It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects.

Performative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Designing the Performative Object: a study in designing mindful interaction through artefacts, in Redmond, J., D.

==Mindfulness and Silicon Valley ==
Classes in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants.  [[Google]] has implemented a series of bimonthly "mindfulness lunches" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations.  Both [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture.  The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the [[emotional intelligence]] of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In Silicon Valley, Meditation Is No Fad. It Could Make Your Career|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/06/meditation-mindfulness-silicon-valley/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet Addiction and Mindfulness==
Mindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as [[Internet addiction disorder]], a form of [[behavioral addiction]].  There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gamblingtherapy.org/sites/default/files/resources/mindfulness-as-a-treatment-for-behavioural-addiction-2155-6105.1000e122.pdf|title = Mindfulness as a treatment for behavioural-addiction|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Experts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly.  Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bewell.stanford.edu/mindful-use-of-technology|title = Mindful Use of Technology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In technological addiction, the reward system, located in the [[mid-brain]] and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food.  In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group.  In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~allenlavoie/papers/reddit.pdf|title = The Effects of Feedback on Human Behavior in Social Media: An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Model|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of [[gamification]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Critics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots. The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate "unplugging" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4).  They also state that the concept of  Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.

=== Mobile ===
Mobile meditation applications like Calm and Headspace have over a million users and are increasing in popularity. Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety. They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seeking Serenity on a Screen|url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/seeking-serenity-on-a-screen/?_r=0|website = Well|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disconnectionists===
Criticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology. This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Disconnectionists|url = http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-disconnectionists/|website = The New Inquiry|date = 2013-11-13|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness in technology and has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires. Anti-disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia-manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of [[conservatism]].  Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8146|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2009-05-19|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2688844|pmid = 19416813|pages = 8146–8150|volume = 106|issue = 20|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0812647106|first = Jonah|last = Berger|first2 = Gaël Le|last2 = Mens}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated.  This argument itself can be tied back to [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], [[Walter Benjamin]] on aura, [[Jacques Ellul]] on technique, [[Jean Baudrillard]] on simulations, or [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment.  Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion.  The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s idea of "normalization" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied.

===Buddhist concerns===
There is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling mediation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects.  The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnect form actual grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness is not Sati?|url = http://www.theravadin.org/2009/02/13/mindfulness-is-not-sati/|website = Theravadin|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of mindfulness in [[Cognitive Behavior Therapy]] also comment on this as a possible problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   However, critics of the movement fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed [[McMindfulness]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Beyond McMindfulness|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas.  Buddhists differentiate between [[Right Mindfulness]] ([[samma sati]]) and [[Wrong Mindfulness]] ([[miccha sati]]). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself.  Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley Tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee. Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way to coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solve them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Natural farming''' is an [[ecological farming]] approach established by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] (1913–2008), a Japanese [[farmer]] and philosopher, introduced in his 1975 book ''[[The One-Straw Revolution]]''. Fukuoka described his way of farming as {{Eigo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref name="One–Straw_Translator's_Notes"&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as "the Fukuoka Method", "the natural way of farming" or "do-nothing farming". The title refers not to lack of effort, but to the avoidance of manufactured inputs and equipment. Natural farming is related to fertility farming, [[organic farming]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[agroecology]], [[agroforestry]], [[ecoagriculture]] and [[permaculture]], but should be distinguished from [[biodynamic agriculture]].

The system works along with the natural biodiversity of each farmed area, encouraging the complexity of living organisms—both plant and animal—that shape each particular ecosystem to thrive along with food plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/life-and-death/|title=Life and Death in the Field {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuoka saw farming both as a means of producing food and as an aesthetic or spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was, "the cultivation and perfection of human beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.08.001| title = Linking foresight and sustainability: An integral approach| journal = Futures| volume = 42| pages = 59| year = 2010| last1 = Floyd | first1 = J. | last2 = Zubevich | first2 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agriculture: A Fundamental Principle |last=Hanley |first=Paul |journal=Journal of Bahá’í Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1990 |url=https://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327202848/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that farmers could benefit from closely observing local conditions.&lt;ref name="Duncan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Adrien MacKinley Duncan|title=The Centrality of Agriculture: Between Humankind and the Rest of Nature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=c0ZcTTXw9a8C}}|year=1996|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural farming is a closed system, one that demands no human-supplied inputs and mimics nature.&lt;ref&gt;Trees on Organic Farms, Mirret, Erin Paige. North Carolina State University, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka's ideas radically challenged conventions that are core to modern agro-industries; instead of promoting importation of nutrients and chemicals, he suggested an approach that takes advantage of the local environment.&lt;ref name="stock and morse"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Morse|author2=Michael Stockin|title=People and Environment: Development for the Future|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nPeHlOh0y_UC}}|year=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-85728-283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural farming is considered a subset of organic farming, it differs greatly from conventional [[organic farming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Participating in Nature: Thomas J. Elpel's Field Guide to Primitive Living Skills |last=Elpel |first=Thomas J. |date=November 1, 2002 |isbn=1892784122}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Fukuoka considered to be another modern technique that disturbs nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf  What Does Natural Farming Mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720070520/http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} by Toyoda, Natsuko&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka claimed that his approach prevents [[water pollution]], [[biodiversity loss]] and [[soil erosion]], while providing ample amounts of food.&lt;ref name="Reddystudies2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Priya Reddy|author2=Prescott College Environmental studies|title=Sustainable Agricultural Education: An Experiential Approach to Shifting Consciousness and Practices|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=dtE8MwEACAAJ}}|year=2010|publisher=Prescott College|isbn=978-1-124-38302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fukuoka's principles ==

In principal, practitioners of natural farming maintain that it is not a ''technique'' but a ''view'', or a way of seeing ourselves as a [[Nature connectedness|part of nature]], rather than separate from or above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/masanobu-fukuoka-and-natural-farming/|title=Masanobu Fukuoka and Natural Farming {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the methods themselves vary widely depending on culture and local conditions.

Rather than offering a structured method, Fukuoka distilled the natural farming mindset into five principles:&lt;ref name="Norberg-HodgeGoering2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helena Norberg-Hodge|author2=Peter Goering|author3=John Page|title=From the Ground Up: Rethinking Industrial Agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4sQTjNulnQC|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many of his plant varieties and practices relate specifically to Japan and even to local conditions in [[Humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] western [[Shikoku]], his philosophy and the governing principles of his farming systems have been applied widely around the world, from Africa to the [[temperate]] northern hemisphere.

Principally, natural farming minimises human labour and adopts, as closely as practical, nature's production of foods such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[daikon]] or [[citrus]] in biodiverse agricultural [[ecosystem]]s. Without [[plow]]ing, [[seeds]] [[germination|germinate]] well on the surface if site conditions meet the needs of the seeds placed there. Fukuoka used the presence of [[spiders]] in his fields as a [[key performance indicator]] of [[sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Fukuoka specifies that the ground remain covered by [[weed]]s, [[white clover]], [[alfalfa]], [[herbaceous]] [[legume]]s, and sometimes deliberately sown [[herbaceous plant]]s. [[Ground cover]] is present along with grain, vegetable crops and [[orchards]]. Chickens run free in orchards and [[ducks]] and [[carp]] populate rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically ground layer plants including weeds may be cut and left on the surface, returning their nutrients to the soil, while suppressing weed growth. This also facilitates the sowing of seeds in the same area because the dense ground layer hides the seeds from animals such as birds.

For summer rice and winter barley grain crops, ground cover enhances [[nitrogen fixation]]. [[Straw]] from the previous crop [[mulch]]es the [[topsoil]]. Each grain crop is sown before the previous one is harvested by [[broadcast seeding|broadcasting]] the seed among the standing crop. Later, this method was reduced to a single direct seeding of clover, barley and rice over the standing heads of rice.&lt;ref name="Fukuoka1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masanobu Fukuoka|title=The Natural Way of Farming: The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy|url={{google books|plainurl=y |id=L3M_AAAAYAAJ}}|year=1987|publisher=Japan Publications|isbn=978-0-87040-613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a denser crop of smaller, but highly productive and stronger plants.

Fukuoka's practice and philosophy emphasised small scale operation and challenged the need for mechanised farming techniques for high productivity, efficiency and economies of scale.  While his family's farm was larger than the Japanese average, he used one field of grain crops as a small-scale example of his system.

== Yoshikazu Kawaguchi ==
[[File:Natural farmer Yoshikazu Kawaguchi.jpg|thumb|Yoshikazu Kawaguchi at Akame Natural Farm School]]
Widely regarded as the leading practitioner of the second-generation of natural farmers, [[Yoshikazu Kawaguchi]] is the instigator of Akame Natural Farm School, and a related network of volunteer-based "no-tuition" natural farming schools in Japan that numbers 40 locations and more than 900 concurrent students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=(Japan))|first=Hokazono, S.(Mie Univ., Tsu|last2=K.|first2=Ohara,|date=2007-01-01|title=The role of a learning site for urban residents hoping to do farming: Focusing on the spread of 'natural farming' by the Akame Natural Farming School|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=JP2008004433|journal=Journal of Rural Problems (Japan)|language=Japanese|issn=0388-8525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kawaguchi's practice is based on Fukuoka's principals, his methods differ notably from those of Fukuoka. He re-states the core values of natural farming as:

# Do not plow the fields
# Weeds and insects are not your enemies
# There is no need to add fertilizers
# Adjust the foods you grow based on your local climate and conditions

Kawaguchi's recognition outside of Japan has become wider after his appearance as the central character in the documentary ''[[Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness]]'', through which his interviews were translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org|title=Final Straw – Food - Earth - Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of several books in Japan, though none have been officially translated into English.

Since 2016, Kawaguchi is no longer directly instructing at the Akame school which he founded. He is still actively teaching however, holding open farm days at his own natural farm in Nara prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37510039_Body_and_Earth_Are_Not_Two_Kawaguchi_Yoshikazu's_NATURAL_FARMING_and_American_Agriculture_Writers |title='Body and Earth Are Not Two': Kawaguchi Yoshikazu's NATURAL FARMING and American Agriculture Writers|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climax ecosystems ==

In [[ecology]], [[climax ecosystem]]s are mature ecosystems that have reached a high degree of stability, productivity and diversity (see [[old-growth forest]]). Natural farmers attempt to mimic those virtues, creating a comparable climax ecosystem, and employ advanced techniques such as [[intercropping]], [[companion planting]] and [[integrated pest management]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== No-till ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

Natural farming recognizes soils as a fundamental natural asset. Ancient soils possess physical and chemical attributes that render them capable of generating and supporting life abundance. It can be argued that tilling actually degrades the delicate balance of a climax soil:

# Tilling may destroy crucial physical characteristics of a soil such as ''[[water potential|water suction]]'', its ability to send moisture upwards, even during dry spells. The effect is due to pressure differences between soil areas. Furthermore, tilling most certainly destroys [[soil horizon]]s and hence disrupts the established flow of nutrients. A study suggests that reduced tillage preserves the crop residues on the top of the soil, allowing organic matter to be formed more easily and hence increasing the total organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to conventional tillage. The increases in organic carbon and nitrogen increase aerobic, facultative anaerobic and [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Principles and Applications of Soil Microbiology| last1=Sylvia |first1=D.M. |last2=Fuhrmann |first2=J.J. |last3=Hartel |first3=P.G. |last4=Zuberer |first4=D.A.| publisher=Prentice Hall| location=New Jersey| year=1999| ISBN=0130941174| pages=39–41 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tLjwAAAAMAAJ|p=39}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tilling over-pumps oxygen to local soil residents, such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. As a result, the chemistry of the soil changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the [[microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]] mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil.
# Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen.&lt;!-- just oxygen? --&gt; They also create room for beneficial [[insect]]s and [[annelid]]s (the phylum of [[worm]]s). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the [[rhizobium]]) that can fix nitrogen.

Fukuoka advocated avoiding any change in the [[natural landscape]]. This idea differs significantly from some recent permaculture practice that focuses on permaculture design, which may involve the change in landscape. For example, [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture farmer, advocates the creation of terraces on slopes to control soil erosion. Fukuoka avoided the creation of terraces in his farm, even though terraces were common in China and Japan in his time. Instead, he prevented soil erosion by simply growing trees and shrubs on slopes.

== Variants of natural farming ==
[[File:P-14 lady beetle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ladybird]]s consume [[aphid]]s and are considered beneficial by natural farmers that apply [[biological control]].]]Although the term "natural farming" came into common use in the English language during the 1980s with the translation of the book ''One Straw Revolution'', the natural farming mindset itself has a long history throughout the world, spanning from historical Native American practices to modern day urban farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenatureofcities.com/2015/09/16/a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=Lydon|first=Patrick|date=2015-09-16|website=The Nature of Cities|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociecity.org/post/2015/urban-empathy-garden/|title=Artwork / Urban Empathy Garden {{!}} SocieCity|website=sociecity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.1525/j.ctt1ppfn4|title=Tending the Wild: Native American Knowledge and the Management of California's Natural Resources|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

Some variants, and their particularities include:

=== Fertility farming ===

In 1951, [[Frank Newman Turner|Newman Turner]] advocated the practice of "fertility farming", a system featuring the use of a cover crop, no tillage, no chemical fertilizers, no pesticides, no weeding and no composting. Although Turner was a commercial farmer and did not practice random seeding of [[seed balls]], his "fertility farming" principles share similarities with Fukuoka's system of natural farming. Turner also advocate a "natural method" of [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Newman Turner| title=Fertility Farming| ISBN=978-1601730091| year=1951| publisher=Faber and Faber Limited| url=http://www.journeytoforever.org/farm_library/turner/turnerToC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native American ===
Recent research in the field of [[traditional ecological knowledge]] finds that for over one hundred centuries, Native American tribes worked the land in strikingly similar ways to today's natural farmers. Author and researcher M. Kat Anderson writes that "According to contemporary Native Americans, it is only through interaction and relationships with native plants that mutual respect is established."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nature Farming (Mokichi Okada) ===
Japanese farmer and philosopher [[Mokichi Okada]], conceived of a "no fertilizer" farming system in the 1930s that predated Fukuoka. Okada used the same [[Chinese characters]] as Fukuoka's "natural farming" however, they are translated into English slightly differently, as [[nature farming]].&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|publisher=Research Signpost|year=2001 |location=T.

=== Rishi Kheti ===
In [[India]], natural farming is often referred to as "Rishi Kheti", a practice which includes ancient [[Vedic]] principles of farming including use of animal waste and herbs for controlling pests and promoting growth.&lt;ref name="Mr. Fukuoka news article 2010 Mumbai India"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report_masanobu-fukuoka-the-man-who-did-nothing_1426864 "Masanobu Fukuoka: The man who did nothing By Malvika Tegta"] "DNA Daily News and Analysis".

At Rasulia we called it 'rishi kheti' (agriculture of the sages)."&lt;/ref&gt; The rishi or Indian sages use cow products like buttermilk, milk, curd and its waste urine for preparing growth promoters. The Rishi or Vedic farming is regarded as non-violent farming without any usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. They obtain high quality natural or organic produce having medicinal values. Today still a small number of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu use this farming method in India.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Zero Budget Farming===
Zero Budget Farming is a variation on natural farming developed in, and primarily practiced in southern India.It also called spiritual farming .The method involves [[mulching]], [[intercropping]], and the use of several preparations which include [[cow dung]]. These preparations, generated on-site, are central to the practice, and said to promote microbe and earthworm activity in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Budget Natural Farming in India|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-bl990e.pdf|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian agriculturist [[Subhash Palekar]] has researched and written extensively on this method.

[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Catholic philosopher]] of the [[Middle Ages]], revived and developed the concept of natural law from [[ancient Greek philosophy]].]]

'''Natural law''' ({{lang-la|ius naturale}}, ''lex naturalis'') is a [[philosophy]] asserting that certain [[human right|rights]] are inherent by virtue of [[human nature]], endowed by [[nature]]—traditionally by [[God]] or a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] source—and that these can be understood universally through [[human reason]]. As determined by nature, the '''law of nature''' is implied to be objective and universal;&lt;ref name="IESS"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Strauss|first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Strauss |title=Natural Law |encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |year=1968 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; it exists independently of human understanding, and of the [[positive law]] of a given [[Sovereign state|state]], [[political order]], [[legislature]] or [[society]] at large.

Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze [[human nature]] to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] binding rules of [[moral behavior]] from nature's or God's creation of [[reality]] and [[Human|mankind]]. The concept of natural law was documented in [[ancient Greek philosophy]], including [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommen, Heinrich A., ''The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social Philosophy'' trans. Thomas R. Hanley, O.S.B., Ph.D. (B. Herder Book Co., 1947 [reprinted 1959]), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in [[Roman philosophy]] by [[Cicero]]. References to natural law are also found in the Old and New Testaments of the [[Bible]], later expounded upon in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Christian philosopher]]s such as [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The [[School of Salamanca]] made notable contributions during the [[Renaissance]]. Modern natural law theories were greatly developed in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], combining inspiration from [[Roman law]] with philosophies like [[social contract]] theory. Key proponents were [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], [[John Locke]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]],  [[Emmerich de Vattel]], [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Francesco Mario Pagano]]. It was used to challenge the [[divine right of kings]], and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[government]]—and thus legal rights—in the form of [[classical republicanism]]. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

Contemporarily, the concept of natural law is closely related to the concept of [[natural rights]]. Indeed, many [[philosopher]]s, [[jurist]]s and scholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights ({{lang-la|[[ius naturale]]}}), or [[natural justice]].&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; while others distinguish between natural law and natural right.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt;

Because of the intersection between natural law and [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], natural law has been cited as a component in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776), and claimed by natural law proponents thus to be incorporated into its constitution, as well as in the [[France|French]] ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789), hence providing a foundation for the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' (1948) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

== History ==
The use of natural law, in its various incarnations, has varied widely throughout history. There are a number of theories of natural law, that differ from each other with respect to the role that morality plays in determining the authority of legal norms. This article deals with its usages separately rather than attempt to unify them into a single theory.

===Judaism===
Those who see [[Torah|biblical]] support for the doctrine of natural law often point to [[Abraham]]'s interrogation of [[God in Judaism|God]] on behalf of the iniquitous city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abraham even dares to tell the Most High that his plan to destroy the city (Genesis 18:25) would violate God’s own justice: “That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?" This almost Socratic reply became for later writers the beginnings of natural rights theory. In this respect, natural law as described in the interaction between Abraham and God predates the later Greek exposition of it by Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.

However, an even earlier set of laws is attributed to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The seven [[Noahidism|Noahide]] laws as traditionally enumerated are the following:&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared values: The Noahide Laws|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/shared-values-noahide-laws/|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Meri|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim-Jewish Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXF9DAAAQBAJ&amp; |date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-38320-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Not to worship idols.
# Not to curse God.
# To establish courts of justice.
# Not to commit murder.
# Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
# Not to steal.
# Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
According to the [[Genesis flood narrative]], a [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]] covered the whole world, killing every surface-dwelling creature except Noah, his wife, his sons and their wives, and the animals taken aboard [[Noah's Ark]]. According to this, all modern humans are descendants of Noah, thus the name Noahide Laws in reference to laws that apply to all of humanity. After the flood, God sealed a [[Covenant (Biblical)#Noahiccovenant|covenantwith Noah]] with the following admonitions ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9|HE}}):
* Flesh of a living animal: "Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.” (9:4)
* Murder and courts: "And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man." (9:5-6)

===Ancient Greece===
==== Plato ====
{{Original research section|date=May 2011}}Although [[Plato]] did not have an explicit theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase 'natural law' except in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 484 and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 83e), his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wild|first=John|year=1953|title=Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 508a.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the [[Theory of forms|forms]], most fundamentally the [[Form of the Good]], which Plato describes as "the brightest region of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', 518b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 540a, 517b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', 205e–6a.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'', Plato describes how the experience of the Beautiful by Socrates enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', 211d–e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the ideal community is "a city which would be established in accordance with nature".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 428e9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aristotle ====
{{see also|Treatise on Law}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]].]]
[[Greek philosophy]] emphasized the distinction between "nature" (''physis'', ''φúσις'') on the one hand and "law", "custom", or "convention" (''nomos'', ''νóμος'') on the other. What the law commanded would be expected to vary from place to place, but what was "by nature" should be the same everywhere. A "law of nature" would therefore have the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt; Against the [[conventionalism]] that the distinction between nature and custom could engender, [[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαιον φυσικον'', [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref name="Shellens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shellens|first=Max Solomon|title=Aristotle on Natural Law|journal=Natural Law Forum|volume=4|issue=1|year=1959|pages=72–100|doi=10.1093/ajj/4.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's association with natural law may be due to the interpretation given to his works by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Jaffa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffa|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry V. Jaffa|title=Thomism and Aristotelianism|origyear=1952|year=1979|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Corbett|first=Ross J.|title=The Philosophic Context of the Development of Natural Law| date=April 2012 |conference=Midwest Political Science Association|ssrn=2021235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle notes that [[natural justice]] is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of [[distributive justice|distributive]] and [[restorative justice|corrective justice]] that would be established under the best political community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' that the best regime may not rule by law at all.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ross J.|last=Corbett|title=The Question of Natural Law in Aristotle|journal=History of Political Thought|volume=30|issue=2| date=Summer 2009 |pages=229–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Universal law is the law of Nature. For there really is, as every one to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men, even on those who have no association or covenant with each other. It is this that Sophocles' Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition: she means that it was just by nature:

:"Not of to-day or yesterday it is,
:But lives eternal: none can date its birth."

And so Empedocles, when he bids us kill no living creature, he is saying that to do this is not just for some people, while unjust for others:

:"Nay, but, an all-embracing law, through the realms of the sky
:Unbroken it stretcheth, and over the earth's immensity."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Rhetoric, Book I – Chapter 13, {{cite web |url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213075009/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |archivedate=2015-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics believe that the context of this remark suggests only that Aristotle advised that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was averse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; Moreover, they claim that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law provided in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt; Aristotle's paternity of natural law tradition is consequently disputed.

==== Stoic natural law&lt;!--linked from 'Stoicism'--&gt; ====
The development of this tradition of [[natural justice]] into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. The rise of natural law as a universal system coincided with the rise of large empires and kingdoms in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Introduction to Jurisprudence'', Seventh Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} Whereas the "higher" law that Aristotle suggested one could appeal to was emphatically [[Appeal to nature|natural]], in contradistinction to being the result of [[Divinity|divine]] [[Positive law|positive]] [[legislation]], the Stoic natural law was indifferent to either the natural or divine source of the law: the Stoics asserted the existence of a rational and purposeful order to the universe (a [[Divine law|divine]] or [[eternal law]]), and the means by which a rational being lived in accordance with this order was the natural law, which inspired actions that accorded with virtue.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt;

As the English historian A. J. Carlyle (1861–1943) notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca&amp;nbsp;... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West, vol. 1|location=Edinburgh|year=1903|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that "the idea of the equality of men is the most profound contribution of the Stoics to political thought" and that "its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles H.|last=McIlwain|title=The Growth of Political Thought in the West: From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages|location=New York|year=1932|pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natural law first appeared among the stoics who believed that God is everywhere and in everyone (see [[classical pantheism]]). According to this belief, within humans there is a "divine spark" which helps them to live in accordance with nature. The stoics felt that there was a way in which the universe had been designed, and that natural law helped us to harmonise with this.

=== Ancient Rome ===

[[Cicero]] wrote in his [[De Legibus]] that both justice and law originate from what nature has given to humanity, from what the human mind embraces, from the function of humanity, and from what serves to unite humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'', bk. 1, sec. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; For Cicero, natural law obliges us to contribute to the general good of the larger society.&lt;ref name="Barham"&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis|last=Barham|contribution=Introduction|title=The Political Works of Marcus Tullius Cicero|location=London|publisher=Edmund Spettigue|year=1842|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808205547/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of positive laws is to provide for "the safety of citizens, the preservation of states, and the tranquility and happiness of human life." In this view, "wicked and unjust statutes" are "anything but 'laws,'" because "in the very definition of the term 'law' there [[wikt:inheres|inheres]] the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 2, sec. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Law, for Cicero, "ought to be a reformer of vice and an incentive to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, sec. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero expressed the view that "the virtues which we ought to cultivate, always tend to our own happiness, and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits."&lt;ref name="Barham" /&gt;

In De Re Publica, he writes:
{{quote|There is indeed a law, right reason, which is in accordance with nature ; existing in all, unchangeable, eternal. Commanding us to do what is right, forbidding us to do what is wrong. It has dominion over good men, but possesses no influence over bad ones. No other law can be substituted for it, no part of it can be taken away, nor can it be abrogated altogether. Neither the people or the senate can absolve from it. It is not one thing at Rome, and another thing at Athens : one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow ; but it is eternal and immutable for all nations and for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303160447/http://www.archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |archivedate=2017-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero influenced the discussion of natural law for many centuries to come, up through the era of the American Revolution. The jurisprudence of the [[Roman Empire]] was rooted in Cicero, who held "an extraordinary grip ... upon the imagination of posterity" as "the medium for the propagation of those ideas which informed the law and institutions of the empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Norris|last=Cochrane|title=Christianity and Classical Culture: A Study of Thought and Action from Augustus to Augustine|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1957|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's conception of natural law "found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum of Gratian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward S.|last=Corwin|title=The "Higher Law" Background of American Constitutional Law|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1955|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his summary of medieval natural law, quoted Cicero's statement that "nature" and "custom" were the sources of a society's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Treatise on Law'' (Summa Theologica, Questions 90–97), ed.

Cook, 21 Jan. 1816; quoted in ''Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The New Testament carries a further exposition on the Abrahamic dialogue and links to the later Greek exposition on the subject, when [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]] states: "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual historian A. J. Carlyle has commented on this passage, "There can be little doubt that St Paul's words imply some conception analogous to the 'natural law' in [[Cicero]], a law written in men's hearts, recognized by man's reason, a law distinct from the positive law of any State, or from what St Paul recognized as [[Torah|the revealed law of God]]. It is in this sense that St Paul's words are taken by the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries like [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary of Poitiers]], [[Ambrose|St Ambrose]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of their interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West|volume=1|page=83|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorymedival00carlgoog|location=New York|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|year=1903|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608004930/https://archive.org/details/ahistorymedival00carlgoog|archivedate=2016-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its origins in the Old Testament, early [[Church Fathers]], especially those in the [[Western Christianity|West]], saw natural law as part of the natural foundation of [[Christianity]]. The most notable among these was [[Augustine of Hippo]], who equated natural law with humanity's [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] state; as such, a life according to unbroken human nature was no longer possible and persons needed instead to seek healing and salvation through the [[divine law]] and [[divine grace|grace]] of [[Jesus Christ]].

In the twelfth century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] equated the natural law with divine law. [[Albertus Magnus]] would address the subject a century later, and his pupil, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' [[Treatise on Law|I-II qq. 90–106]], restored Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature's participation in the eternal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm#article2 Summa Theologica, I-II, Q. 91, Art. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704182120/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm |date=2007-07-04 }} "I answer that"&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the [[Eternal law]], it needed to be supplemented by revealed [[Divine law]]. (See also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].) Meanwhile, Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the 'appearance' of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a 'perversion of law.'&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologicae,'' Q. 95, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those  laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=Tony|year=2000|title=Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law|journal=Political Studies|volume=48|pages=929–46|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00288|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural law was inherently [[teleological]], however, it is most assuredly not [[deontological]]. For Christians, natural law is how human beings manifest the divine image in their life. This mimicry of [[Jesus Christ|God]]'s own life is impossible to accomplish except by means of the power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that humanity is made in God's image, humanity is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how humanity displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within human control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction may or may not be attained, but salvation will be attained. The [[State (polity)|state]], in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.

In the 16th century, the [[School of Salamanca]] ([[Francisco Suárez]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], etc.) further developed a philosophy of natural law.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], some [[Protestant denominations]] maintained parts of the Catholic concept of natural law. The [[England|English]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Richard Hooker]] from the [[Church of England]] adapted [[Thomism|Thomistic]] notions of natural law to [[Anglicanism]]  five principles: to live, to learn, to reproduce, to worship God, and to live in an ordered society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | title=Natural Law aspects of theory | publisher=Rsrevision.com | medium=[[PDF]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026050618/http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | archivedate=2014-10-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic natural law===
[[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], an [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]] and [[polymath]] [[Islamic science|scientist]], understood natural law as the survival of the fittest. He argued that the [[:wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] between [[human]] beings can only be overcome through a [[divine law]], which he believed to have been sent through [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. This is also the position of the [[Ashari]] school, the largest school of Sunni theology.&lt;ref name="Corbin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbin|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard and [[Philip Sherrard]]|publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies|isbn=0-7103-0416-1|page=39|year=1993|origyear= 1964}} (original in French.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), in his treatise on ''Justice and Jihad'' and his commentary on Plato's ''Republic'', writes that the human mind can know of the unlawfulness of killing and stealing and thus of the five [[maqasid]] or higher intents of the Islamic [[sharia]] or to protect religion, life, property, offspring, and reason. The concept of natural law entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through his Aristotelian commentaries, influencing the subsequent [[Averroism|Averroist]] movement and the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What the Law Requires Is Written on Their Hearts: Noachic and Natural Law among German-Speakers in Early Modern North America|first=A. G.|last=Roeber|journal=[[William and Mary Quarterly]]|series=Third Series|volume=58|issue=4|date=October 2001|pages=883–912 [887]|doi=10.2307/2674504|jstor=2674504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maturidi]] school, the second largest school of Sunni theology, posits the existence of a form of natural law. [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of 'good' and 'evil' without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which is known to be evil by reason alone due to people's working hard for their property. Killing, fornication, and drinking alcohol were all 'evils' the human mind could know of according to al-Maturidi. The concept of ''[[Istislah]]'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, ''istislah'' calls good whatever is connected to one of five "basic goods". [[Al-Ghazali]] abstracted these "basic goods" from the legal precepts in the Qur'an and Sunnah: they are religion, life, reason, lineage and property. Some add also "honour". [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] also posited that human reason could discern between 'great sins' and good deeds.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Brehon law&lt;!--linked from 'Early Irish law'--&gt;===
Early Irish law, An Senchus Mor (The Great Tradition) mentions in a number of places ''recht aicned'' or natural law. This is a concept predating European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: fír (truth) and dliged (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term córus (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have passed the test of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time&lt;ref&gt;Neil McLeod, ''The Concept of Law in Ancient Irish Jurisprudence'', in "Irish Jurist" 17 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were written in the oldest dialect of the Irish language, called Bérla Féini [Bairla-faina], which even at the time was so difficult that persons about to become brehons had to be specially instructed in it, the length of time from beginning to becoming a learned Brehon was usually 20 years. Although under the law any third person could fulfill the duty if both parties agreed, and both were sane.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/ancientlaws01hancuoft&lt;/ref&gt; It has been included in an Ethno-Celtic breakaway subculture, as it has religious undertones and freedom of religious expression allows it to once again be used as a valid system in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/62421128B249FE9480257FC3005C7C67?opendocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824231855/http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/62421128B249FE9480257FC3005C7C67?opendocument |archivedate=2017-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To know what is right, one must use one's reason and apply it to Thomas Aquinas' precepts. This reason is believed to be embodied, in its most abstract form, in the concept of a primary precept: "Good is to be sought, evil avoided."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Thomas explains that:
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
there belongs to the natural law, first, certain most general precepts, that are known to all;
      and secondly, certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were,
      conclusions following closely from first principles. As to those general principles, the
      natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be blotted out from men's hearts. But it is blotted
      out in the case of a particular action, insofar as reason is hindered from applying the
      general principle to a particular point of practice, on account of concupiscence or some
      other passion, as stated above (77, 2). But as to the other, i.e., the secondary precepts, the
      natural law can be blotted out from the human heart, either by evil persuasions, just as in
      speculative matters errors occur in respect of necessary conclusions; or by vicious customs
      and corrupt habits, as among some men, theft, and even unnatural vices, as the Apostle
      states (Rm. i), were not esteemed sinful.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, while the primary and immediate precepts cannot be "blotted out", the secondary precepts can be. Therefore, for a deontological ethical theory they are open to a surprisingly large amount of interpretation and flexibility. Any rule that helps humanity to live up to the primary or subsidiary precepts can be a secondary precept, for example:
* Drunkenness is wrong because it injures one's health, and worse, destroys one's ability to reason, which is fundamental to humans as rational animals (i.e., does not support self-preservation).
* Theft is wrong because it destroys social relations, and humans are by nature social animals (i.e., does not support the subsidiary precept of living in society).

Natural moral law is concerned with both exterior and interior acts, also known as action and motive. Simply doing the right thing is not enough; to be truly moral one's motive must be right as well. For example, helping an old lady across the road (good exterior act) to impress someone (bad interior act) is wrong. However, good intentions don't always lead to good actions. The motive must coincide with the cardinal or theological virtues. [[Cardinal virtues]] are acquired through reason applied to nature; they are:
# [[Prudence]]
# [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]]
# [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]
# [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]]

The [[theological virtues]] are:

# [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]
# [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]
# [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]

According to Aquinas, to lack any of these virtues is to lack the ability to make a moral choice. For example, consider a person who possesses the virtues of justice, prudence, and fortitude, yet lacks temperance. Due to their lack of self-control and desire for pleasure, despite their good intentions, they will find themself swaying from the moral path.

===English jurisprudence===
Heinrich A. Rommen remarked upon "the tenacity with which the spirit of the English common law retained the conceptions of natural law and equity which it had assimilated during the Catholic Middle Ages, thanks especially to the influence of [[Henry de Bracton]] (d. 1268) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (d. cir. 1476)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Heinrich A.|last=Rommen|title=The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy|others=Trans. and rev.

Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's preeminence extended across the ocean: "For the American revolutionary leaders, 'law' meant Sir Edward Coke's custom and right reason."&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''In a Defiant Stance: The Conditions of Law in Massachusetts Bay, The Irish Comparison, and the Coming of the American Revolution'' (University Park, Penn.: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1977), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to [[James Madison]] in 1826 that before the Revolution, the first volume of Coke's ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' "was the universal elementary book of law students, and a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English liberties." See ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', vol. 16, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke defined law as "perfect reason, which commands those things that are proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things".&lt;ref&gt;John Underwood Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory," in ''Law, Liberty, and Parliament: Selected Essays on the Writings of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Allen D. Boyer (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004), pp. 108–09; citing Edward Coke, ''First Part of the Institutes'', 319b.&lt;/ref&gt; For Coke, human nature determined the purpose of law; and law was superior to any one person's reason or will.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory", p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's discussion of natural law appears in his report of ''Calvin's Case'' (1608): "The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction." In this case the judges found that "the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature: secondly, that the law of nature is part of the law of England: thirdly, that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law: fourthly, that the law of nature is immutable." To support these findings, the assembled judges (as reported by Coke, who was one of them) cited as authorities [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]]; as well as Bracton, Fortescue, and [[Christopher St. Germain|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, pp. 195–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Coke, the most famous common law jurist of the seventeenth century is [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]]. Hale wrote a treatise on natural law that circulated among English lawyers in the eighteenth century and survives in three manuscript copies.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, London, Add. MS 18235, fols. 41–147 [1693]; Harley MS 7159, fols. 1–266 [1696]; Hargrave MS 485 [late-eighteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; This natural-law treatise has been published as ''Of the Law of Nature'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hale, [http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature ''Of the Law of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514014830/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature |date=2016-05-14 }}, ed. David S. Sytsma (CLP Academic, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Hale's definition of the natural law reads: "It is the Law of Almighty God given by him to Man with his Nature discovering the morall good and moral evill of Moral Actions, commanding the former, and forbidding the latter by the secret voice or dictate of his implanted nature, his reason, and his concience."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed natural law as antecedent, preparatory, and subsequent to civil government,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 85–106.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that human law "cannot forbid what the Law of Nature injoins, nor Command what the Law of Nature prohibits."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited as authorities [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41, 52, 64, 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of Hobbes's reduction of natural law to self-preservation and Hobbes's account of the state of nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 43, 86, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but drew positively on  [[Hugo Grotius]]'s ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'', [[Francisco Suárez]]'s ''Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore'', and [[John Selden]]'s ''De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 7–8, 17, 49, 63, 111–19, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the thirteenth century, it was held that "the law of nature...is the ground of all laws"&lt;ref&gt;8 Edw 4 fol. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Chancellor and Judges that "it is required by the law of nature that every person, before he can be punish'd, ought to be present; and if absent by contumacy, he ought to be summoned and make default".&lt;ref&gt;9 Ed. 4 fol. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fort. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 1824, we find it held that "proceedings in our Courts are founded upon the law of England, and that law is again founded upon the law of nature and the revealed law of God. If the right sought to be enforced is inconsistent with either of these, the English municipal courts cannot recognize it."&lt;ref&gt;2 B. &amp; C. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes====
[[File:Thomas Hobbes.jpeg|thumb|right|190px|Thomas Hobbes]]
By the 17th century, the [[medieval]] [[teleology|teleological]] view came under intense criticism from some quarters. [[Thomas Hobbes]] instead founded a [[social contract|contractarian theory]] of [[legal positivism]] on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s modifications on [[legal positivism]] further developed the theory.

As used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his treatises ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and ''[[De Cive]]'', natural law is "a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Leviathan, pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hobbes, there are nineteen Laws. The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of Leviathan ("of the first and second natural laws; and of contracts"); the others in chapter XV ("of other laws of nature").
* The first law of nature is ''that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war''.
* The second law of nature is ''that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth, as for peace, and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.''
* The third law is ''that men perform their covenants made.'' In this law of nature consisteth the fountain and original of justice... when a covenant is made, then to break it is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than the not performance of covenant. And whatsoever is not unjust is just.
* The fourth law is ''that a man which receiveth benefit from another of mere grace, endeavour that he which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will.'' Breach of this law is called ingratitude.
* The fifth law is complaisance: ''that every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest.'' The observers of this law may be called sociable; the contrary, stubborn, insociable, forward, intractable.
* The sixth law is ''that upon caution of the future time, a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.''
* The seventh law is ''that in revenges, men look not at the greatness of the evil past, but the greatness of the good to follow.''
* The eighth law is ''that no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare hatred or contempt of another.'' The breach of which law is commonly called contumely.
* The ninth law is ''that every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature.'' The breach of this precept is pride.
* The tenth law is ''that at the entrance into the conditions of peace, no man require to reserve to himself any right, which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest.'' The breach of this precept is arrogance, and observers of the precept are called modest.
* The eleventh law is that ''if a man be trusted to judge between man and man, that he deal equally between them.''
* The twelfth law is ''that such things as cannot be divided, be enjoyed in common, if it can be; and if the quantity of the thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of them that have right.''
* The thirteenth law is ''the entire right, or else...the first possession'' (in the case of alternating use), of a thing that ''can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common'' should be determined by lottery.
* The fourteenth law is that ''those things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor divided, ought to be adjudged to the first possessor; and in some cases to the first born, as acquired by lot.''
* The fifteenth law is that ''all men that mediate peace be allowed safe conduct.''
* The sixteenth law is ''that they that are at controversie, submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator.''
* The seventeenth law is ''that no man is a fit Arbitrator in his own cause.''
* The eighteenth law is that no man should serve as a judge in a case if ''greater profit, or honour, or pleasure apparently ariseth [for him] out of the victory of one party, than of the other.''
* The nineteenth law is that in a disagreement of fact, the judge should not give more weight to the testimony of one party than another, and absent other evidence, should give credit to the testimony of other witnesses.

Hobbes's philosophy includes a frontal assault on the founding principles of the earlier natural legal tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution'' (Chapel Hill, 1992), pp. 372–73&lt;/ref&gt; disregarding the traditional association of virtue with happiness,&lt;ref&gt;A Hobbes Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111140201/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise re-defining "law" to remove any notion of the promotion of the common good.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stoner, Jr., ''Common Law and Liberal Theory: Coke, Hobbes, and the Origins of American Constitutionalism'' (Lawrence, Kansas, 1992), 71; see also John Phillip Reid, "In the Taught Tradition: The Meaning of Law in Massachusetts-Bay Two-Hundred Years Ago," ''Suffolk University Law Review'' 14 (1980), 938–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes has no use for [[Aristotle]]'s association of nature with human perfection, inverting Aristotle's use of the word "nature." Hobbes posits a primitive, unconnected state of nature in which men, having a "natural proclivity...to hurt each other" also have "a Right to every thing, even to one anothers body";&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''De Cive (The Citizen)'', ed. Sterling P. Lamprecht (New York, 1949; orig. 1642), ch. 2, sec. 2 (p. 29).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nothing can be Unjust" in this "warre of every man against every man" in which human life is "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, &amp; Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill'' (Mineola, N.Y., 2006; orig. 1651), pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 72); p. 1, ch. 13 (pp. 21, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting [[Cicero]]'s view that people join in society primarily through "a certain social spirit which nature has implanted in man,"&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De re publica'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, ch. 25, sec. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes declares that men join in society simply for the purpose of "getting themselves out from that miserable condition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent...to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep them in awe."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 2, ch. 17 (p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his campaign against the classical idea of natural human sociability, Hobbes inverts that fundamental natural legal maxim, the Golden Rule. Hobbes's version is ''"Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe."''&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 1, ch. 15 (p. 79)(emphasis in original). See also Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern'', p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cumberland's rebuttal of Hobbes====
The English cleric [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] wrote a lengthy and influential attack on Hobbes's depiction of individual self-interest as the essential feature of human motivation. Historian Knud Haakonssen has noted that in the eighteenth century, Cumberland was commonly placed alongside [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]] "in the triumvirate of seventeenth-century founders of the 'modern' school of natural law."&lt;ref&gt;Knud Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," in ''English Philosophy in the Age of Locke'', ed. M.A. Stewart (Oxford, 2000), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth-century philosophers [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] "were obviously inspired in part by Cumberland."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, ''Natural Law and Moral Philosophy: From Grotius to the Scottish Enlightenment'' (Cambridge, 1996), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jon Parkin likewise describes Cumberland's work as "one of the most important works of ethical and political theory of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's'' De Legibus Naturae (Bury St. Edmunds, United Kingdom, 1999), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Parkin observes that much of Cumberland's material "is derived from Roman [[Stoicism]], particularly from the work of [[Cicero]], as "Cumberland deliberately cast his engagement with Hobbes in the mould of Cicero's debate between the Stoics, who believed that nature could provide an objective morality, and [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]], who argued that morality was human, conventional and self-interested."&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Cumberland de-emphasized the overlay of Christian dogma (in particular, the doctrine of "original sin" and the corresponding presumption that humans are incapable of "perfecting" themselves without divine intervention) that had accreted to natural law in the Middle Ages.

By way of contrast to Hobbes's multiplicity of laws, Cumberland states in the very first sentence of his ''Treatise of the Laws of Nature'' that "all the Laws of Nature are reduc'd to that one, of Benevolence toward all Rationals."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cumberland, ''A Treatise of the Laws of Nature'', trans. John Maxwell (Indianapolis, 2005; orig. 1727), "Contents" (p. 237). Cumberland's treatise was originally published in Latin in 1672. A Latin edition was published in Germany in 1684.&lt;/ref&gt; He later clarifies: "By the name ''Rationals'' I beg leave to understand, as well ''God'' as ''Man''; and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero." Cumberland argues that the mature development ("perfection") of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 1, sec. 33 (p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; For Cumberland, human interdependence precludes Hobbes's natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival. However, Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of "[[enlightened self-interest]]." Rather, the "proper moral love of humanity" is "a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," pp. 34, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland concludes that actions "principally conducive to our Happiness" are those that promote "the Honour and Glory of God" and also "Charity and Justice towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 13 (pp. 523–24).&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the "pursuit of our own Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 12 (p. 525)&lt;/ref&gt; He cites "reason" as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in "the most extensive Benevolence," but he also mentions as "Essential Ingredients of Happiness" the "Benevolent Affections," meaning "Love and Benevolence towards others," as well as "that Joy, which arises from their Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 15 (pp. 527–28).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American jurisprudence====
The [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] states that it has become necessary for the people of the United States to assume "the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them". Some early American lawyers and judges perceived natural law as too tenuous, amorphous, and evanescent a legal basis for grounding concrete [[rights]] and [[Limited government|governmental limitations]].&lt;ref name=Edlin&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300065 |title=Judicial Review without a Constitution |author=Douglas E.

===European liberal natural law===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Dr Sir Albericus Gentilis (Father of international law).png|thumb|190px|[[Alberico Gentili|Dr Alberico Gentili]], the founder of the science of international law.]]
Liberal natural law grew out of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian natural law theories and out of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] revision of natural law, sometimes in an uneasy balance of the two.

[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] based their philosophies of international law on natural law. In particular, his writings on [[freedom of the seas]] and [[just war theory]] directly appealed to natural law. About natural law itself, he wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''[[De iure belli ac pacis]]'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous [[argument]] ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology. However, German church-historians Ernst Wolf and M. Elze disagreed and claimed that Grotius' concept of natural law did have a theological basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Wolf, ''Naturrecht'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band IV (1960), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1357&lt;/ref&gt; In Grotius' view, the [[Old Testament]] contained moral precepts (e.g. the [[Decalogue]]) which [[Christ]] confirmed and therefore were still valid. Moreover, they were useful in explaining the content of natural law. Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elze, ''Grotius, Hugo'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II (1958), col. 1885&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, [[Samuel Pufendorf]] gave natural law a theological foundation and applied it to his concepts of government and [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Hohlwein, ''Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V (1961), col. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (filtered through [[Richard Hooker]]) or [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] radical reinterpretation, though the effect of Locke's understanding is usually phrased in terms of a revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesian [[social contract|contractarian]] grounds. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''Two Treatises of Government'', Second Treatise, Chapter 13, §149&lt;/ref&gt;

While Locke spoke in the language of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher [[Jeremy Waldron]] has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron (2002), ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''. Cambridge University Press, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the [[Decalogue]], [[Christ]]'s teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 12–15, 45–46, 95–97, 195–98, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the [[equality of the sexes]] ("Adam and Eve"), from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/? Genesis 1, 26–28], the starting-point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 21–43&lt;/ref&gt; One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], arguably echoing Locke, appealed to [[inalienable rights|unalienable rights]] in the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are ''created'' equal, that they are endowed by their ''Creator'' with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lockean idea that governments need the [[consent of the governed]] was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005),''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 49–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213180721/http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] theorist [[Murray Rothbard]] argues that "the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|chapter=Natural Law Versus Positive Law|pages=17|author=Rothbard, Murray|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126063000/http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Mises]] states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R.

Economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek|F. A. Hayek]] said that, originally, "the term 'natural' was used to describe an orderliness or regularity that was not the product of deliberate human will. Together with 'organism' it was one of the two terms generally understood to refer to the spontaneously grown in contrast to the invented or designed. Its use in this sense had been inherited from the stoic philosophy, had been revived in the twelfth century, and it was finally under its flag that the late Spanish Schoolmen developed the foundations of the genesis and functioning of spontaneously formed social institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=97–98|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that 'natural' was "the product of designing reason" is a product of a seventeenth century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] reinterpretation of the law of nature. [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]], for example, when referred to the 'natural' price, explained that it is "so called because 'it results from the thing itself without regard to laws and decrees, but is dependent on many circumstances which alter it, such as the sentiments of men, their estimation of different uses, often even in consequence of whims and pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1973, 1976, 1979, 1982|isbn=0-415-09868-8|location=London|pages=21|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008175341/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And even [[John Locke]], when talking about the foundations of natural law and explaining what he thought when citing "reason", said: "By reason, however, I do not think is meant here that faculty of the understanding which forms traint of thought and deduces proofs, but certain definite principles of action from which spring all virtues and whatever is necessary for the proper moulding of morals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays Concerning the Law of Nature|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=W. von Leyden|year=1954|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This anti-rationalist approach to human affairs, for Hayek, was the same which guided [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish enlightenment]] thinkers, such as [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]], to make their case for liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=98–99|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, no one can have the knowledge necessary to plan society, and this "natural" or "spontaneous" order of society shows how it can efficiently "plan" bottom-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|title=The Trend of Economic Thinking|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=22–24|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829053955/http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the idea that law is just a product of deliberate design, denied by natural law and linked to [[legal positivism]], can easily generate [[totalitarianism]]: "If law is wholly the product of deliberate design, whatever the designer decrees to be law is just by definition and unjust law becomes a contradiction in terms. The will of the duly authorized legislator is then wholly unfettered and guided solely by his concrete interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|title=The Constitution of Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=238–39|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926153103/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is wrong because law cannot be just a product of "reason": "no system of articulated law can be applied except within a framework of generally recognized but often unarticulated rules of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies In Philosophy, Politics And Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=102|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a secular critique of the natural law doctrine was stated by [[Pierre Charron]] in his ''De la sagesse'' (1601): "The sign of a natural law must be the universal respect in which it is held, for if there was anything that nature had truly commanded us to do, we would undoubtedly obey it universally: not only would every nation respect it, but every individual. Instead there is nothing in the world that is not subject to contradiction and dispute, nothing that is not rejected, not just by one nation, but by many; equally, there is nothing that is strange and (in the opinion of many) unnatural that is not approved in many countries, and authorized by their customs."

==Contemporary jurisprudence==

In [[jurisprudence]], ''natural law'' can refer to the several doctrines:
* That [[justice|just laws]] are [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature; that is, they can be "discovered" or "found" but not "created" by such things as a [[bill of rights]];
* That they can emerge by the natural process of resolving conflicts, as embodied by the evolutionary process of the common law; or
* That the meaning of law is such that its content cannot be determined except by reference to moral principles. These meanings can either oppose or complement each other, although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws.

Whereas [[legal positivism]] would say that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would say that there is something legally deficient about an unjust norm. [[Legal interpretivism]], famously defended in the English-speaking world by [[Ronald Dworkin]], claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.

Besides [[utilitarianism]] and [[Kantianism]], natural law jurisprudence has in common with [[virtue ethics]] that it is a live option for a [[first principles]] ethics theory in [[analytic philosophy]].

The concept of natural law was very important in the development of the English [[common law]]. In the struggles between [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[British monarchy|monarch]], Parliament often made reference to the [[Fundamental Laws of England]], which were at times said to embody natural law principles since [[time immemorial]] and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to [[William Blackstone]], however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of [[Equity (law)|equity]], but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication of natural law in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of [[legal positivism]], like [[Jeremy Bentham]], have also been staunch critics of the common law.

Natural law jurisprudence is currently undergoing a period of reformulation (as is legal positivism). The most prominent contemporary natural law jurist, Australian [[John Finnis]], is based in Oxford, but there are also Americans [[Germain Grisez]], [[Robert P. George]], and Canadian [[Joseph Boyle (jurist)|Joseph Boyle]] and Brazilian Emídio Brasileiro. All have tried to construct a new version of natural law. The 19th-century [[anarchism|anarchist]] and legal theorist, [[Lysander Spooner]], was also a figure in the expression of modern natural law.

"New Natural Law" as it is sometimes called, originated with Grisez. It focuses on "basic human goods", such as human life, knowledge, and aesthetic experience, which are [[Self-evidence|self-evidently]] and intrinsically worthwhile, and states that these goods reveal themselves as being [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]] with one another.

The tensions between the natural law and the positive law have played, and continue to play a key role in the development of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Prabhakar Singh, "From 'narcissistic' positive international law to 'universal' natural international law: the dialectics of 'absentee colonialism'", ''African Journal of International and Comparative Law'', 2008, 16(1), 56–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, '''near sets''' are either spatially [[closeness (mathematics)|close]] or descriptively close. Spatially close sets have nonempty [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. In other words, spatially close sets are not [[disjoint sets]], since they always have at least one element in common. Descriptively close sets contain elements that have matching descriptions. Such sets can be either disjoint or non-disjoint sets. Spatially near sets are also descriptively near sets.

[[File:Minimally Descriptive Near Sets.svg|right|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' Descriptively, minimally near sets]]

The underlying assumption with descriptively close sets is that such sets contain elements that have location and measurable features such as colour and frequency of occurrence. The description of the element of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is defined by a [[feature vector]]. Comparison of feature vectors provides a basis for measuring the closeness of descriptively near sets. Near set theory provides a formal basis for the observation, comparison, and classification of elements in sets based on their closeness, either spatially or descriptively. Near sets offer a framework for solving problems based on [[perception|human perception]] that arise in areas such as [[image processing]], [[computer vision]] as well as engineering and science problems.

Near sets have a variety of applications in areas such as [[topology]]{{cref2|37|1}}, [[pattern recognition|pattern detection]] and [[statistical classification|classification]]{{cref2|50|1}}, [[abstract algebra]]{{cref2|51|1}}, mathematics in computer science{{cref2|38|1}}, and solving a variety of problems based on human perception{{cref2|42|1}}{{cref2|82|1}}{{cref2|47|1}}{{cref2|52|1}}{{cref2|56|1}} that arise in areas such as [[image analysis]]{{cref2|54|1}}{{cref2|14|1}}{{cref2|46|1}}{{cref2|17|1}}{{cref2|18|1}}, image processing{{cref2|40|1}}, [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]]{{cref2|13|1}}, [[ethology]]{{cref2|64|1}}, as well as engineering and science problems{{cref2|55|1}}{{cref2|64|2}}{{cref2|42|2}}{{cref2|19|1}}{{cref2|17|2}}{{cref2|18|2}}. From the beginning, descriptively near sets have proved to be useful in applications of topology{{cref2|37|2}}, and visual pattern recognition {{cref2|50|2}}, spanning a broad spectrum of applications that include [[camouflage]] detection, [[micropaleontology]], handwriting forgery detection, biomedical image analysis, [[content-based image retrieval]], [[population dynamics]], [[quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]], [[textile design]], [[visual merchandising]], and topological psychology.

As an illustration of the degree of descriptive nearness between two sets, consider an example of the Henry colour model for varying degrees of nearness
between sets of picture elements in pictures (see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|17|3}} §4.3). The two pairs of ovals in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 contain coloured segments. Each segment in the figures corresponds to an equivalence class where all pixels in the class have similar descriptions, ''i.e.'', picture elements with similar colours. The ovals in Fig.1 are closer to each other descriptively than the ovals in Fig. 2.

== History ==
It has been observed that the simple concept of ''nearness'' unifies various concepts of topological structures{{cref2|20|1}} inasmuch as the [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Near''' of all nearness spaces and nearness preserving maps contains categories '''sTop''' (symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps{{cref2|3|1}}), '''Prox''' ([[proximity space]]s and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-maps{{cref2|8|1}}{{cref2|67|1}}), '''Unif''' ([[uniform space]]s and uniformly continuous maps{{cref2|81|1}}{{cref2|77|1}}) and '''Cont''' (contiguity spaces and contiguity maps{{cref2|24|1}}) as embedded full subcategories{{cref2|20|2}}{{cref2|59|1}}. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AMer}}&lt;/math&gt; are shown to be full supercategories of various well-known categories, including the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps, and the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps. The notation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\hookrightarrow\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; reads ''category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; ''is embedded in category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon ANear}&lt;/math&gt; are supercategories for a variety of familiar categories{{cref2|76|1}} shown in Fig. 3. Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach nearness spaces and contractions, and let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach merotopic spaces and contractions.

[[File:EANear and eAMer Supercategories.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Supercats]]

Among these familiar categories is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt;, the symmetric form of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Top}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[category of topological spaces]]), the category with objects that are topological spaces and morphisms that are continuous maps between them{{cref2|1|1}}{{cref2|32|1}}. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^{\infty}}&lt;/math&gt; with objects that are extended metric spaces is a subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AP}&lt;/math&gt; (having objects &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach spaces and contractions)  (see also{{cref2|57|1}}{{cref2|75|1}}). Let &lt;math&gt;\rho_X,\rho_Y&lt;/math&gt; be extended pseudometrics on nonempty sets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The map &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. For nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; , the distance function &lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}:2^X\times 2^X\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}(A,B) =\begin{cases}
\inf{\{\rho(a,b): a\in A, b\in B\}}, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ and }B\text{ are not empty},\\ 
\infty, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ or }B\text{ is empty}. 
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'''AP''' is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt; is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f.&lt;/math&gt; Since the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps is a full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is also a full supercategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt;. The category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is a topological construct{{cref2|76|2}}.

[[File:Frigyes Riesz.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' [[Frigyes Riesz]], 1880-1956]]

The notions of near and far{{cref2|A|1|group=2}} in mathematics can be traced back to works by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] and [[Felix Hausdorff]]. The related notions of resemblance and similarity can be traced back to [[Henri Poincaré|J.H. Poincaré]], who introduced sets of similar sensations (nascent tolerance classes) to represent the results of G.T. Fechner's sensation sensitivity experiments{{cref2|10|1}} and a framework for the study of resemblance in representative spaces as models of what he termed physical continua{{cref2|63|1}}{{cref2|60|1}}{{cref2|61|1}}. The elements of a physical continuum (pc) are sets of sensations. The notion of a pc and various representative spaces (tactile, visual, motor spaces) were introduced by Poincaré in an 1894 article on the mathematical continuum{{cref2|63|2}}, an 1895 article on space and geometry{{cref2|60|2}} and a compendious 1902 book on science and hypothesis{{cref2|61|2}} followed by a number of elaborations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|62|1}}. The 1893 and 1895 articles on continua (Pt. 1, ch. II) as well as representative spaces and geometry (Pt. 2, ch IV) are included as chapters in{{cref2|61|3}}. Later, F. Riesz introduced the concept of proximity or nearness of pairs of sets at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1908{{cref2|65|1}}.

During the 1960s, [[Christopher Zeeman|E.C. Zeeman]] introduced tolerance spaces in modelling visual perception{{cref2|83|1}}. A.B. Sossinsky observed in 1986{{cref2|71|1}} that the main idea underlying tolerance space theory comes from Poincaré, especially{{cref2|60|3}}. In 2002, Z. Pawlak and J. Peters{{cref2|B|1|group=2}} considered an informal approach to the perception of the nearness of physical objects such as snowflakes that was not limited to spatial nearness. In 2006, a formal approach to the descriptive nearness of objects was considered by J. Peters, A. Skowron and J. Stepaniuk{{cref2|C|1|group=2}} in the context of proximity spaces{{cref2|39|1}}{{cref2|33|1}}{{cref2|35|1}}{{cref2|21|1}}. In 2007, descriptively near sets were introduced by J. Peters{{cref2|D|1|group=2}}{{cref2|E|1|group=2}} followed by the introduction of tolerance near sets{{cref2|41|1}}{{cref2|45|1}}. Recently, the study of descriptively near sets has led to algebraic{{cref2|22|1}}{{cref2|51|2}}, topological and proximity space{{cref2|37|4}} foundations of such sets.

== Nearness of sets ==
The adjective ''near'' in the context of near sets is used to denote the fact that observed feature value differences of distinct objects are small enough to be
considered indistinguishable, ''i.e.'', within some tolerance.

The exact idea of closeness or 'resemblance' or of 'being within tolerance' is universal enough to appear, quite naturally, in almost any mathematical setting
(see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|66|1}}). It is especially natural in mathematical applications: practical problems, more often than not, deal with approximate input data and only require viable results with a tolerable level of error{{cref2|71|2}}.

The words ''near'' and ''far'' are used in daily life and it was an incisive suggestion of [[Frigyes Riesz|F. Riesz]]{{cref2|65|2}} that these intuitive concepts be made rigorous. He introduced the concept of nearness of pairs of sets at the ICM in Rome in 1908. This concept is useful in simplifying teaching calculus and advanced calculus. For example, the passage from an intuitive definition of continuity of a function at a point to its rigorous epsilon-delta definition is sometime difficult for teachers to explain and for students to understand. Intuitively, [[continuous function|continuity]] can be explained using nearness language, ''i.e.'', a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, provided points &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; go into points &lt;math&gt;\{f(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;. Using Riesz's idea, this definition can be made more precise and its contrapositive is the familiar definition{{cref2|4|1}}{{cref2|36|1}}.

== Generalization of set intersection ==
From a spatial point of view, nearness (a.k.a. proximity) is considered a generalization of set [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. For disjoint sets, a form of nearness set intersection is defined in terms of a set of objects (extracted from disjoint sets) that have similar features within some
tolerance (see, ''e.g.'', §3 in{{cref2|80|1}}). For example, the ovals in Fig. 1 are considered near each other, since these ovals contain pairs of classes that display similar (visually indistinguishable) colours.

== Efremovič proximity space ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[metric space|metric]] [[topological space]] that is endowed with one or more proximity relations and let &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  The collection &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

There are many ways to define Efremovič proximities on topological spaces (discrete proximity, standard proximity, metric proximity, Čech proximity, Alexandroff proximity, and Freudenthal proximity),  For details, see § 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–94 in{{cref2|6|1}}.
The focus here is on ''standard proximity'' on a topological space.  For &lt;math&gt;A,B\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided their closures share a common point.

The ''closure'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;A\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is the usual [[Kuratowski closure axioms|Kuratowski closure]] of a set{{cref2|F|1|group=2}}, introduced in § 4, p.&amp;nbsp;20{{cref2|27}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mbox{cl}(A) &amp;= \left\{x\in X: D(x,A)=0\right\},\ \mbox{where}\\
D(x,A) &amp;= inf\left\{d(x,a): a\in A\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hausdorff distance (see § 22, p.&amp;nbsp;128, in{{cref2|15|1}}) between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,a) = \left|x - a \right|&lt;/math&gt; (standard distance)). A ''standard''  proximity relation is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mbox{cl}(A)\ \cap\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points in common, the sets are ''far''from each other (denoted &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The following EF-proximity{{cref2|G|1|group=2}} space axioms are given by Jurij Michailov Smirnov{{cref2|67|2}} based on what [[Vadim Arsenyevich Efremovich|Vadim Arsenyevič Efremovič]] introduced during the first half of the 1930s{{cref2|8|2}}. Let &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;.

;EF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.3 : Two points are close, if and only if, they are the same point.
;EF.4 : All sets are far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Efremovič-axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; is called an EF-[[proximity space]].   In this context, a [[space]] is a set with some added structure.  With a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the structure of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the EF-proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the intersection of all closed sets that contain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 1{{cref2|67|3}} : The closure of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Visualization of EF-axiom ==

[[File:Sample EF-space.svg|thumb|'''Figure 5.''' Example of a descriptive EF-proximity relation between sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C^c&lt;/math&gt;]]

Let the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be represented by the points inside the rectangular region in Fig. 5.  Also, let &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; be any two non-intersection subsets (''i.e.'' subsets spatially far from each other) in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in Fig. 5.  Let &lt;math&gt;C^c = X \backslash C&lt;/math&gt; ([[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;). Then from the EF-axiom, observe the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A\ &amp;\underline{\delta}\ B,\\
B &amp;\subset C,\\
D &amp;= C^c,\\
X &amp;= D \cup C,\\
 A &amp;\subset D,\ \mbox{hence, we can write}\\
A\ \underline{\delta}\ B\ &amp;\Rightarrow\ A\ \underline{\delta}\ C\ \mbox{and}\ B\ \underline{\delta}\ D,\ \mbox{for some}\ C,D\ \mbox{in}\ X \mbox{ so that } C\cup D = X. \qquad \blacksquare
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Descriptive proximity space ==
Descriptively near sets were introduced as a means of solving classification and pattern recognition problems arising from disjoint sets that resemble each other{{cref2|44|1}}{{cref2|43|1}}.  Recently, the connections between near sets in EF-spaces and near sets in descriptive EF-proximity spaces have been explored in{{cref2|53|1}}{{cref2|48|1}}.

Again, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric topological space and let &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \left\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\right\}&lt;/math&gt; a set of probe functions that represent features of each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  The assumption made here is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains non-abstract points that have measurable features such as gradient orientation.  A non-abstract point has a location and features that can be measured (see § 3 in {{cref2|26|1}}).

A ''probe function'' &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; represents a feature of a sample point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = (\phi_1(x),\dots,\phi_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an n-dimensional real Euclidean [[vector space]].  &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a feature vector for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which provides a description of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. For example, this leads to a proximal view of sets of picture points in digital images{{cref2|48|2}}.

To obtain a descriptive proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;), one first chooses a set of probe functions.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}: 2^X\longrightarrow 2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt; be a mapping on a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; into a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt;.   For example, let &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A),\mathcal{Q}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denote sets of descriptions of points in &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{Q}(A) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(a): a\in A\right\},\\
\mathcal{Q}(B) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(b): b\in B\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;A\  \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively near'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;A\  \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively far from'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The descriptive proximity of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(B)) \neq \emptyset.
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''descriptive intersection'' &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B = \left\{x\in A\cup B:\mathcal{Q}(A)\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \Phi(a) = \Phi(b)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a\in A, b\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can be disjoint and yet &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; can be nonempty.
The descriptive proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       \mbox{cl}(A)\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points with matching descriptions, the sets are ''descriptively far'' from each other 
(denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The binary relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''descriptive EF-proximity'', provided the following axioms are satisfied for &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

;dEF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.3 : Two points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; are descriptively close, if and only if, the description of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; matches the description of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.4 : All nonempty sets are descriptively far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are descriptively far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Descriptive Efremovič axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta_{\Phi})&lt;/math&gt; is called a descriptive proximity space.

== Proximal relator spaces ==
A ''relator'' is a nonvoid family of relations  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; on a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|72|1}}.  The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; (also denoted &lt;math&gt;X(\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt;) is called a relator space. Relator spaces are natural generalizations of ordered sets and uniform spaces{{cref2|73|1}}{{cref2|74|1}}}. With the introduction of a family of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta})&lt;/math&gt;.  For simplicity, we consider only two proximity relations, namely, the Efremovič proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|8|3}} and the descriptive proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; in defining the ''descriptive relator'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|53|2}}{{cref2|48|3}}. The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''proximal relator space ''{{cref2|49|1}}. In this work, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes a metric topological space that is endowed with the relations in a proximal relator. With the introduction of &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt;, the traditional closure of a subset (''e.g.'', {{cref2|9|1}}{{cref2|7|1}}) can be compared with the more recent descriptive closure of a subset.

In a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the ''descriptive closure of a set'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A) = \left\{x\in X: {\Phi(x)} \delta \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in the descriptive closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, provided the closure of &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))&lt;/math&gt; have at least one element in common.

== Descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods ==

[[File:Descriptive.svg|thumb|'''Figure 6.''' Example depicting &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods]]

In a pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;N_{x,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;), for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
N_{x,\varepsilon} = \left\{y\in X: d(x,y) &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The interior of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) and boundary of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{bdy}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) in a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{int}(A) = \left\{x\in X: N_{x,\varepsilon}\subseteq A\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{bdy}(A) = \mbox{cl}(A)\setminus\mbox{int}(A).
&lt;/math&gt;

A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''natural strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|5|1}}{{cref2|6|2}}} (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \ll_{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;A\subset\ \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).  Correspondingly, a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''descriptive strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)\subset\ \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; be a descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood relation defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mathcal{Q}(A)\subset \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided the description of each &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the set of descriptions of the points &lt;math&gt;b\in \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;.  Now observe that any &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in the proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; have disjoint &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods,  ''i.e.'',
 
:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B\Leftrightarrow A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E1, B\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E2,\ \mbox{for some}\ E1,E2\subset X\ \mbox{(See Fig. 6).}
&lt;/math&gt;

; Theorem 6 {{cref2|50|5}} : Any two sets descriptively far from each other belong to disjoint descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods in a descriptive proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

A consideration of strong containment of a nonempty set in another set leads to the study of hit-and-miss topologies and the Wijsman topology{{cref2|2|1}}.

== Tolerance near sets ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be a real number greater than zero.  In the study of sets that are proximally near within some tolerance, the set of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; is augmented with a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] tolerance proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;) defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &amp;= inf\left\{d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)): \Phi(a)\in\mathcal{Q}(A), \Phi(a)\in \mathcal{Q}(B)\right\},\\
d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)) &amp;= \mathop{\sum}_{i=1}^n |\phi_i(a)-\phi_i(b)|,\\
\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon} &amp;= \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       |D(\mbox{cl}(A), \mbox{cl}(B))| &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}} = \mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}\cup\left\{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, a nonempty set equipped with the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt; has underlying [[mathematical structure|structure]] provided by the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; and provides a basis for the study of tolerance near sets in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are near within some tolerance.  Sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in a descriptive pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; are tolerance near sets (''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &lt; \varepsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Tolerance classes and preclasses ==
Relations with the same formal properties as similarity relations of sensations considered by Poincaré{{cref2|62|2}} are nowadays, after [[Christopher Zeeman|Zeeman]]{{cref2|83|2}}, called ''[[tolerance relation]]s''. A ''tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;'' is a relation &lt;math&gt;\tau \subseteq O \times O&lt;/math&gt; that is reflexive and symmetric.  In algebra, the term ''tolerance relation'' is also used in a narrow sense to denote reflexive and symmetric relations defined on universes of algebras that are also compatible with operations of a given algebra, ''i.e.'', they are generalizations of congruence relations (see ''e.g.'',{{cref2|12|1}}). In referring to such relations, the term ''algebraic tolerance'' or the term ''algebraic tolerance relation'' is used.
Transitive tolerance relations are equivalence relations. A set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; together with a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''tolerance space'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt;). A set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq O&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-preclass'' (or briefly ''preclass'' when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood) if and only if for any &lt;math&gt;x,y \in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The family of all preclasses of a tolerance space is naturally ordered by set inclusion and preclasses that are maximal with respect to set inclusion are called ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-classes'' or just ''classes'', when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood. The family of all classes of the space &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; is particularly interesting and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt;. The family &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt; is a covering of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|58|1}}.

The work on similarity by Poincaré and Zeeman presage the introduction of near sets{{cref2|44|2}}{{cref2|43|1}} and research on similarity relations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|79|1}}.  In science and engineering, tolerance near sets are a practical application of the study of sets that are near within some tolerance.  A tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in(0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is directly related to the idea of closeness or resemblance (''i.e.'', being within some tolerance) in comparing objects.
By way of application of Poincaré's approach in defining visual spaces and Zeeman's approach to tolerance relations, the basic idea is to compare objects such as image patches in the interior of digital images.

=== Examples ===

'''Simple Example'''

The following simple example demonstrates the construction of tolerance classes from real data. Consider the 20 objects in the table below with &lt;math&gt;|\Phi| = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"

|}

Let a [[tolerance relation]] be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\cong_{\varepsilon} = \{(x,y)\in O \times O :\; \parallel\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)\parallel_{_2} \leq \varepsilon\} &lt;/math&gt;

Then, setting &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0.1&lt;/math&gt; gives the following tolerance classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H_{\cong_{\varepsilon}}(O) = &amp; \{ \{x_1, x_8, x_{10}, x_{11}\},\{x_1, x_9, x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{14}\},\\
&amp; \{x_2, x_7, x_{18}, x_{19}\},\\
&amp; \{x_3, x_{12}, x_{17}\},\\
&amp; \{x_4, x_{13}, x_{20}\},\{x_4, x_{18}\},\\
&amp; \{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{16}\},\{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{20}\},\\
&amp; \{x_6, x_{13}, x_{20}\}\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that each object in a tolerance class satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\parallel\Phi(x) -\Phi(y)\parallel_2\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and that almost all of the objects appear in more than one class. Moreover, there would be twenty classes if the indiscernibility relation was used since there are no two objects with matching descriptions.

'''Image Processing Example'''

[[File:NearImages.svg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 7.''' Example of images that are near each other. (a) and (b) Images from the freely available LeavesDataset (see, ''e.g.'', www.vision.caltech.edu/archive.html).]]

The following example provides an example based on digital images. Let a subimage be defined as a small subset of [[pixel]]s belonging to a digital image such that the pixels contained in the subimage form a square. Then, let the sets &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; respectively represent the subimages obtained from two different images, and let &lt;math&gt;O = \{X \cup Y\}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, let the description of an object be given by the Green component in the [[RGB color model]].  The next step is to find all the tolerance classes using the tolerance relation defined in the previous example. Using this information, tolerance classes can be formed containing objects that have similar (within some small &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) values for the Green component in the RGB colour model. Furthermore, images that are near (similar) to each other should have tolerance classes divided among both images (instead of a tolerance classes contained solely in one of the images). For example, the  figure accompanying this example shows a subset of the tolerance classes obtained from two leaf images. In this figure, each tolerance class is assigned a separate colour. As can be seen, the two leaves share similar tolerance classes. This example highlights a need to measure the degree of nearness of two sets.

== Nearness measure ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(U,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; denote a particular descriptive pseudometric EF-proximal relator space equipped with the proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and with nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in 2^U&lt;/math&gt; and with the tolerance relation &lt;math&gt;\cong_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; defined in terms of a set of probes &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in (0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, where

[[File:Visulization of nearness measure.jpg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 8.''' Examples of degree of nearness between two sets: (a) High degree of nearness, and (b) Low degree of nearness.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon} = \{(x, y)\in U\times U\mid\ |\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)| \leq\varepsilon\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Further, assume &lt;math&gt;Z = X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; denote the family of all classes in the space &lt;math&gt;(Z, \simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X, B\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The distance &lt;math&gt;D_{_{tNM}}:2^U\times 2^U:\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; D_{_{tNM}}(X,Y) =
\begin{cases}
   1-tNM(A,B), &amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ and }Y\mbox{ are not empty},\\
   \infty,&amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ or }Y\mbox{ is empty},
	\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
tNM(A, B) = \Biggl(\sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C|\Biggr)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C| \frac{ \min (|C\cap A |,|[C\cap B|)}{\max (|C\cap A |,|C\cap B|)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The details concerning &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; are given in{{cref2|14|2}}{{cref2|16|1}}{{cref2|17|4}}. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that sets that are similar should have a similar number of objects in each tolerance class. Thus, for each tolerance class obtained from the covering of &lt;math&gt;Z=X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of objects that belong to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and takes the ratio (as a proper fraction) of their cardinalities. Furthermore, each ratio is weighted by the total size of the tolerance class (thus giving importance to the larger classes) and the final result is normalized by dividing by the sum of all the cardinalities. The range of &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is in the interval [0,1], where a value of 1 is obtained if the sets are equivalent (based on object descriptions) and a value of 0 is obtained if they have no descriptions in common.

As an example of the degree of nearness between two sets, consider figure below in which each image consists of two sets of objects, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Each colour in the figures corresponds to a set where all the objects in the class share the same description. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that the nearness of sets in a perceptual system is based on the cardinality of tolerance classes that they share. Thus, the sets in left side of the figure are closer (more near) to each other in terms of their descriptions than the sets in right side of the figure.

== Near set evaluation and recognition (NEAR) system ==

[[File:Near gui.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 9.''' NEAR system GUI.]]

The Near set Evaluation and Recognition (NEAR) system, is a system developed to demonstrate practical applications of near set theory to the problems of image segmentation evaluation and image correspondence. It was motivated by a need for a freely available software tool that can provide results for research and to generate interest in near set theory. The system implements a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) where each separate processing task is performed in its own child frame. The objects (in the near set sense) in this system are subimages of the images being processed and the probe functions (features) are image processing functions defined on the subimages. The system was written in C++ and was designed to facilitate the addition of new processing tasks and probe functions. Currently, the system performs six major tasks, namely, displaying equivalence and tolerance classes for an image, performing segmentation evaluation, measuring the nearness of two images, performing Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), and displaying the output of processing an image using a specific probe function.

== Proximity System ==

[[File:Proximity System.png|thumb|'''Figure 10.''' The Proximity System.]]

The Proximity System is an application developed to demonstrate descriptive-based topological approaches to nearness and proximity within the context of digital image analysis. The Proximity System grew out of the work of S. Naimpally and J. Peters on Topological Spaces. The Proximity System was written in Java and is intended to run in two different operating environments, namely on Android smartphones and tablets, as well as desktop platforms running the Java Virtual Machine. With respect to the desktop environment, the Proximity System is a cross-platform Java application for Windows, OSX, and Linux systems, which has been tested on Windows 7 and Debian Linux using the Sun Java 6 Runtime. In terms of the implementation of the theoretical approaches, both the Android and the desktop based applications use the same back-end libraries to perform the description-based calculations, where the only differences are the user interface and the Android version has less available features due to restrictions on system resources.

Leader{{cref2|28|n=1}} and for the symmetric case by M.W. Lodato{{cref2|29|1}}{{cref2|30|1}}{{cref2|31|1}}.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7272">The '''Nine Noble Virtues''', '''NNV''', or '''9NV''' are two sets of moral and situational ethical guidelines within certain sects of [[Odinism]] and [[Ásatrú in the United States|Ásatrú]]. One set was codified by former member of Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists|British Union of Fascists and National Socialists]], John Yeowell&lt;ref&gt;"Rocking For Satan", Searchlight Magazine, November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary,  published in "Comrade" - The News Letter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley: http://fascists.zxq.net/PDFs/ComradeMay2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (a.k.a. Stubba) and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld) of the [[Odinic Rite]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;This Is Odinism: Guidelines for Survival, published by the "Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite" (or Odinist Committee) in 1974 and later re-printed (revised) by Raven Banner Editions (A Raven Banner [Pamphlet) in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odinic-rite.org/main/the-nine-noble-virtues-and-charges-of-the-odinic-rite/ The 9 Noble Virtues - OR Site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asatrufolkassemblyblog.org/2009/07/asatru-like-most-other-religions-has.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the other set codified by [[Stephen A. McNallen]] of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asatrufolkassemblyblog.org/2009/07/asatru-rules-for-personal-conduct-part.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNallen, Stephen A.; An Odinist Anthology: Selections From The Runestone, p. 13, AFA, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others believe that the earlier set, the one the Odinic Rite claim they codified, were originally put together and labelled as the Nine Noble Virtues (the “9NV”) by [[Edred Thorsson]] during his time with the original AFA.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; They are supposedly based on [[virtue]]s found in historical [[Norse paganism]], gleaned from various sources including the [[Poetic Edda]] (particularly the [[Hávamál]] and the [[Sigrdrífumál]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odinic-rite.org/main/the-nine-noble-virtues-and-charges-of-the-odinic-rite/ The 9 Noble Virtues - OR Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and as evident in the [[Icelandic Sagas]]).

The '''Nine Charges''' are a different list of more explicitly phrased moral or ethical guidelines codified at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;"one of the original lists, published by the Odinist Committee [old Odinic Rite], founded in 1972, was referred to as the 'Nine Charges'" Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''Six-Fold Goal''' is yet another list of virtues, given as "Right, Wisdom, Might, Harvest, Frith and Love" by [[Stephen Flowers|Stephen Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson)]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Edred Thorsson, ''A Book of Troth'' (1989){{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aesirian Code of Nine''' is also used by some practitioners of Heathenism, consisting of "honor, knowledge, protect, flourish, change, fairness, conflict, balance and control."

==Nine Noble Virtues==
The list of "Nine Noble Virtues" is due to either John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba)&lt;ref&gt;"Rocking For Satan", Searchlight Magazine, November 1997.
Obituary,  published in "Comrade" - The News Letter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley {{huh|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld), members of [[Odinic Rite]], or alternatively due to [[Edred Thorsson]], at the time member of the ''Asatru Free Assembly''.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 70-72.

[[Stephen A.

The '''Odic force''' (also called '''Od''' [õd], '''Odyle''', '''Önd''', '''Odes''', '''Odylic''', '''Odyllic''', or '''Odems''') is the name given in the mid-19th century to a hypothetical [[vitalism|vital energy]] or [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] by [[Carl Reichenbach|Baron Carl von Reichenbach]]. Von Reichenbach coined the name from that of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[god]] [[Odin]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 299. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Theresa. (2009). ''The Shadow of Enlightenment: Optical and Political Transparency in France, 1789-1848''. Oxford University Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954470-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Odic force is called ''odology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrisomalis|first1=Stephen|title=O|url=http://phrontistery.info/o.html|website=The Phrontistery|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As von Reichenbach was investigating the manner in which the human [[nervous system]] could be affected by various substances, he conceived the existence of a new force allied to [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[heat]], a force which he thought was radiated by most substances, and to the influence of which different persons are variously [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitive]].&lt;ref&gt;Serge Kahili King, Serge King ''Earth Energies: A Quest for the Hidden Power of the Planet'' 1992, Chapter 3 The Odic Force and Reichenbach, pp. 38-60&lt;/ref&gt; He named this [[vitalism|vitalist]] concept ''Odic force''. Proponents say that Odic force permeates all plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Coddington ''Seekers of the Healing Energy: Reich, Cayce, the Kahunas, and Other Masters of the Vital Force'' 1991, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in Odic force said that it is visible in total darkness as colored [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] surrounding living things, crystals, and magnets, but that viewing it requires hours first spent in total darkness, and only very sensitive people have the ability to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Johannes Thiel ''The Diagnosis Of Disease By Observation Of The Eye To Enable Physicians, Healers, Teachers, Parents to Read the Eyes'' Kessinger Reprint Edition, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that it resembles the Asian concepts [[prana]] and [[qi]]. However, they regarded the ''Odic force'' as not associated with breath (like [[India]]'s [[prana]] and the [[qi]] of Chinese martial arts) but rather mainly with biological [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woodhouse ''Paradigm Wars: Worldviews for a New Age'' 1996, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach did not tie Odic force into other vitalist theories. Baron von Reichenbach expounded the concept of Odic force in detail in a book-length article, ''Researches on Magnetism'', ''Electricity'', ''Heat and Light in their Relations to Vital Forces'', which appeared in a special issue of a respected scientific journal, ''Annalen der Chemie und Physik''. He said that (1) the Odic force had a positive and negative [[flux]], and a light and dark side; (2) individuals could forcefully "emanate" it, particularly from the hands, mouth, and forehead; and (3) the Odic force had many possible applications.

The Odic force was conjectured to explain the phenomenon of [[hypnotism]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Odylic force |volume=20 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], impetus was given to this view of the subject following the translation of Reichenbach's ''Researches'' by Dr. Gregory, professor of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; These later researches tried to show many of the Odic phenomena to be of the same nature as those described previously by [[Franz Mesmer]] and even long before Mesmer by [[Swedenborg]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Kelley ''Life Force... the Creative Process in Man And in Nature'' 2004, pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parapsychologists Hippolyte Baraduc and [[Albert de Rochas]] were influenced by the concept of the Odic force.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Clarke, Linda Dalrymple Henderson ''From Energy to Information: Representation in Science and Technology, Art and Literature'' 2002, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach hoped to develop scientific proof for a universal life force; however, his experiments relied on perceptions reported by individuals who claimed to be "sensitive", as he himself could not observe any of the reported phenomena. The "sensitives" had to work in total or near-total darkness to be able to observe the phenomena. Reichenbach stated that, through experimentation, possibly 1/3 of the population could view the phenomenon, but far less otherwise.

== Scientific reception ==

The concept of Odic force was criticized by the [[scientific community]] as there was no reliable or replicable data for its existence. In the 19th century it was described as [[quackery]] by critics and is regarded today as an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Steavenson, William Edward. (1884). ''Electricity &amp; Its Manner of Working in the Treatment of Disease''. London : J. &amp; A. Churchill. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1935). ''Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief''. D. Appleton-Century Company. pp. 341-349. (Published in 1962 by Dover Books as ''Error and Eccentricity in Human Belief'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radner, Daisie; Radner, Michael. (1982). ''Science and Unreason''. Wadsworth. pp. 24-29. {{ISBN|0-534-01153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957) noted that "scientists were unable to duplicate the baron's experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. p. 345. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baron had no training in psychology or psychopathology and no training in devising experiments involving people. He applied many standard scientific techniques and followed standard practices of data collection and recording, including graphs and charts. But he seems to have had no sense of how to do a controlled experiment with so-called "sensitives," people who might better be described as neurotics or delusional. ([[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]] says that for the most part, his subjects were "neurotic young women.") Given the fact that he deceived himself so thoroughly over such a long period of time, it seems reasonable to assume that he was (at the very least) unconsciously suggesting behaviors to his subjects. His enthusiasm for the project undoubtedly biased his subjective observations. That he came to think that the odic force could explain dozens of disparate phenomena, while being unable to convince other scientists that he had discovered anything, signifies the pathological nature of his investigations. Reichenbach's pursuit of the odic force is a classic example of [[pathological science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/reichenbach.html "Reichenbach's Odic force"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary. Retrieved 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists have abandoned concepts such as the Odic force. In western popular culture the name is used in a similar way to [[qi]] or [[prana]] to refer to [[Energy (spiritual)|spiritual energies]] or the [[vital force]] associated with living things. In Europe, the Odic force has been mentioned in books on [[dowsing]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Spiesberger |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |authorlink=Karl Spiesberger |trans-title=Reveal the Power of the Pendulum: Secrets of the Sidereal Pendulum, A Complete Survey of Pendulum Dowsing |isbn=0-572-01419-8 |title=Der erfolgreiche Pendel-Praktiker: Das Geheimnis des siderischen Pendels - Ein Querschnitt durch das Gesamtgebiet der Pendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26241">The '''particle-in-cell''' ('''PIC''') method refers to a technique used to solve a certain class of [[partial differential equations]].  In this method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian]] frame are tracked in continuous [[phase space]], whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) [[Mesh (mathematics)|mesh]] points.

PIC methods were already in use as early as 1955,&lt;ref&gt;

even before the first [[Fortran]] compilers were available. The method gained popularity for plasma simulation in the late 1950s and early 1960s by [[Oscar Buneman|Buneman]], [[John M. Dawson|Dawson]], Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] applications, the method amounts to following the trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or electrostatic) fields computed on a fixed mesh.

== Technical aspects ==

For many types of problems, the classical PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is relatively intuitive and straightforward to implement.  This probably accounts for much of its success, particularly for plasma simulation, for which the method typically includes the following procedures:
* Integration of the equations of motion.
* Interpolation of charge and current source terms to the field mesh.
* Computation of the fields on mesh points.
* Interpolation of the fields from the mesh to the particle locations.

Models which include interactions of particles only through the average fields are called '''PM''' (particle-mesh). Those which include direct binary interactions are '''PP''' (particle-particle). Models with both types of interactions are called '''PP-PM''' or '''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M'''.

Since the early days, it has been recognized that the PIC method is susceptible to error from so-called ''discrete particle noise''.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
This error is statistical in nature, and today it remains less-well understood than for traditional fixed-grid methods, such as [[Numerical partial differential equations|Eulerian]] or [[semi-Lagrangian scheme|semi-Lagrangian]] schemes.

Modern geometric PIC algorithms are based on a very different theoretical framework. These algorithms use tools of discrete manifold, interpolating differential forms, and canonical or non-canonical symplectic integrators to guarantee gauge invariant and conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and more importantly the infinitely dimensional symplectic structure of the particle-field system.

&lt;/ref&gt;
These desired features are attributed to the fact that geometric PIC algorithms are built on the more fundamental field-theoretical framework and are directly linked to the perfect form, i.e., the variational principle of physics.

== Basics of the PIC plasma simulation technique ==

Inside the plasma research community, systems of different species (electrons, ions, neutrals, molecules, dust particles, etc.) are investigated. The set of equations associated with PIC codes are therefore the [[Lorentz force]] as the equation of motion, solved in the so-called ''pusher'' or ''particle mover'' of the code, and [[Maxwell's equations]] determining the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, calculated in the ''(field) solver''.

=== Super-particles ===

The real systems studied are often extremely large in terms of the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called ''super-particles'' are used. A super-particle (or ''macroparticle'') is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the [[Lorentz force]] depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.

The number of real particles corresponding to a super-particle must be chosen such that sufficient statistics can be collected on the particle motion. If there is a significant difference between the density of different species in the system (between ions and neutrals, for instance), separate real to super-particle ratios can be used for them.

=== The particle mover ===

Even with super-particles, the number of simulated particles is usually very large (&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), and often the particle mover is the most time consuming part of PIC, since it has to be done for each particle separately. Thus, the pusher is required to be of high accuracy and speed and much effort is spent on optimizing the different schemes.

The schemes used for the particle mover can be split into two categories, implicit and explicit solvers. While implicit solvers(e.g. implicit Euler scheme) calculate the particle velocity from the already updated fields, explicit solvers use only the old force from the previous time step, and are therefore simpler and faster, but require a smaller time step. Two frequently used schemes are the [[leapfrog method]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; which are explicit solvers.

For plasma applications, the [[leapfrog method]] takes the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}}{\Delta t} = \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} - \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{\Delta t} = \frac{q}{m} \left( \mathbf{E}_k + \frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} + \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{2} \times \mathbf{B}_{k} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; refers to "old" quantities from the previous time step, &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; to updated quantities from the next time step (i.e. &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1} = t_k + \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;), and velocities are calculated in-between the usual time steps &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;.

In comparison, the equations of the Boris scheme are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_{k} + {\Delta t} \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} = \mathbf{u}' + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{h})) \times \mathbf{s},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2} + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h} = q' \mathbf{B}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = 2 \mathbf{h}/(1 + h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;q' = \Delta t \times (q/2m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of its excellent long term accuracy, the Boris algorithm is the de facto standard for advancing a charged particle.  It was realized that the excellent long term accuracy of nonrelativistic Boris algorithm is due to the fact it conserves phase space volume, even though it is not symplectic. The global bound on energy error typically associated with symplectic algorithms still holds for the Boris algorithm, making it an effective algorithm for the multi-scale dynamics of plasmas.  It has also been shown

that one can improve on the relativistic Boris push to make it both volume preserving and have a constant-velocity solution in crossed E and B fields.

=== The field solver ===

The most commonly used methods for solving Maxwell's equations (or more generally, [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE)) belong to one of the following three categories:
* [[Finite difference method]]s (FDM)
* [[Finite element method]]s (FEM)
* [[Spectral method]]s

With the FDM, the continuous domain is replaced with a discrete grid of points, on which the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields are calculated. Derivatives are then approximated with differences between neighboring grid-point values and thus PDEs are turned into algebraic equations.

Using FEM, the continuous domain is divided into a discrete mesh of elements. The PDEs are treated as an [[eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue problem]] and initially a trial solution is calculated using [[basis function]]s that are localized in each element. The final solution is then obtained by optimization until the required accuracy is reached.

Also spectral methods, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), transform the PDEs into an eigenvalue problem, but this time the basis functions are high order and defined globally over the whole domain. The domain itself is not discretized in this case, it remains continuous. Again, a trial solution is found by inserting the basis functions into the eigenvalue equation and then optimized to determine the best values of the initial trial parameters.

=== Particle and field weighting ===

The name "particle-in-cell" originates in the way that plasma macro-quantities ([[number density]], [[current density]], etc.) are assigned to simulation particles (i.e., the ''particle weighting''). Particles can be situated anywhere on the continuous domain, but macro-quantities are calculated only on the mesh points, just as the fields are. To obtain the macro-quantities, one assumes that the particles have a given "shape" determined by the shape function
:&lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate of the particle and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; the observation point. Perhaps the easiest and most used choice for the shape function is the so-called ''cloud-in-cell'' (CIC) scheme, which is a first order (linear) weighting scheme. Whatever the scheme is, the shape function has to satisfy the following conditions:
&lt;ref name=Fehske&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
space isotropy, charge conservation, and increasing accuracy (convergence) for higher-order terms.

The fields obtained from the field solver are determined only on the grid points and can't be used directly in the particle mover to calculate the force acting on particles, but have to be interpolated via the ''field weighting'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i}\mathbf{E}_i S(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; labels the grid point. To ensure that the forces acting on particles are self-consistently obtained, the way of calculating macro-quantities from particle positions on the grid points and interpolating fields from grid points to particle positions has to be consistent, too, since they both appear in [[Maxwell's equations]]. Above all, the field interpolation scheme should conserve [[momentum]]. This can be achieved by choosing the same weighting scheme for particles and fields and by ensuring the appropriate space symmetry (i.e. no self-force and fulfilling the [[Newton's laws of motion|action-reaction law]]) of the field solver at the same time&lt;ref name="Fehske"/&gt;

=== Collisions ===

As the field solver is required to be free of self-forces, inside a cell the field generated by a particle must decrease with decreasing distance from the particle, and hence inter-particle forces inside the cells are underestimated. This can be balanced with the aid of [[Coulomb collision]]s between charged particles. Simulating the interaction for every pair of a big system would be computationally too expensive, so several [[Monte Carlo method]]s have been developed instead. A widely used method is the ''binary collision model'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a real plasma, many other reactions may play a role, ranging from elastic collisions, such as collisions between charged and neutral particles, over inelastic collisions, such as electron-neutral ionization collision, to chemical reactions; each of them requiring separate treatment. Most of the collision models handling charged-neutral collisions use either the ''direct Monte-Carlo'' scheme, in which all particles carry information about their collision probability, or the ''null-collision'' scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Accuracy and stability conditions ===

As in every simulation method, also in PIC, the time step and the grid size must be well chosen, so that the time and length scale phenomena of interest are properly resolved in the problem. In addition, time step and grid size affect the speed and accuracy of the code.

For an electrostatic plasma simulation using an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leapfrog, which is most commonly used), two important conditions regarding the grid size &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and the time step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; should be fulfilled in order to ensure the stability of the solution:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x &lt; 3.4 \lambda_D,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 2 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived considering the harmonic oscillations of a one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma. The latter conditions is strictly required but practical considerations related to energy conservation suggest to use a much stricter constraint where the factor 2 is replaced by a number one order of magnitude smaller. The use of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 0.1 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt; is typical.&lt;ref name=Fehske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

For an explicit electromagnetic plasma simulation, the time step must also satisfy the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; \Delta x / c ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \sim \lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light.

== Applications ==

Within plasma physics, PIC simulation has been used successfully to study laser-plasma interactions, electron acceleration and ion heating in the auroral [[ionosphere]], [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[magnetic reconnection]], as well as ion-temperature-gradient and other microinstabilities in [[tokamak]]s, furthermore [[vacuum arc|vacuum discharges]], and [[dusty plasma]]s.

Hybrid models may use the PIC method for the kinetic treatment of some species, while other species (that are [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]) are simulated with a fluid model.

PIC simulations have also been applied outside of plasma physics to problems in [[solid mechanics|solid]] and [[fluid mechanics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4396">The '''Rosenberg self-esteem scale''' ('''RSES'''), developed by sociologist Dr. Morris Rosenberg,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, M. (1965). Society and the adolescent self-image. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. online pdf here: https://www.docdroid.net/Vt9xpBg/society-and-the-adolescent-self-image-morris-rosenberg-1965.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; is a [[self-esteem]] measure widely used in social-science research. It uses a scale of 0-40 where a score less than 15 may indicate a problematic low self esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://callhelpline.org.uk/Download/Rosenberg%20Self-Esteem%20Scale.pdf|title=Rosenberg self-esteem scale|website=callhelpline.org.uk, by The Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSES is designed similar to the social-survey questionnaires. It is a ten-item [[Likert scale|Likert-type scale]] with items answered on a four-point scale&amp;mdash;from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures state self-esteem by asking the respondents to reflect on their current feelings. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in [[New York State]]. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Blascovich, Jim and Joseph Tomaka. 1993. "Measures of Self-Esteem."

Ann Arbor: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">'''Rosy retrospection''' refers to the [[Psychology|psychological]] [[phenomenon]] of people sometimes judging the past disproportionately more positively than they judge the present. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] occasionally referred to this phenomenon with the [[Latin]] phrase "{{lang|la|memoria praeteritorum bonorum}}", which translates into [[English language|English]] roughly as "the past is always well remembered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201411/the-meaning-nostalgia|title=The Meaning of Nostalgia|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosy retrospection is very closely related to the concept of [[nostalgia]]. The difference between the terms is that rosy retrospection is a [[cognitive bias]], whereas the broader phenomenon of nostalgia is not necessarily based on a biased perspective.

Although rosy retrospection is a cognitive bias, and distorts a person's view of [[reality]] to some extent, some people theorize that it may in part serve a useful purpose in increasing [[self-esteem]] and a person's overall sense of [[well-being]]. For example, Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson mention this possibility in a chapter entitled "A Theory of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/Book_Chapter_Theory_of_Temporal_Adjustments.pdf|title=A Theory of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events|last=|first=|date=|website=MIT|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a book of collected research reports from various authors entitled "Advances in Managerial Cognition and Organizational Information Processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.seu.edu/rosy-retrospection-psychological-phenomenon/|title=Rosy Retrospection: A Psychological Phenomenon|date=2016-02-23|work=Southeastern University|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplifications and exaggerations of [[Memory|memories]] (such as occurs in rosy retrospection) may also make it easier for people's [[brain]]s to store long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories on the brain and make the brain require fewer [[Neuron|neural connections]] to form and engrain memories. [[Mnemonic]]s, psychological [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]], and [[subconscious]] distortions of memories may in part serve a similar purpose: memory compression by way of simplification. [[Data compression]] in [[computer]]s works on similar principles: compression [[algorithm]]s tend to either (1) remove unnecessary details from [[data]] or (2) reframe the details in a simpler way from which the data can subsequently be reconstructed as needed, or (3) both. Much the same can be said of human memories and the human brain's own process of [[memorization]].

In English, the [[idiom]] "[[wikt:rose-colored glasses|rose-colored glasses]]" or "rose-tinted glasses" is also sometimes used to refer to the phenomenon of rosy retrospection. Usually this idiom occurs as some variation of the phrase "seeing things through rose-tinted glasses" or some other roughly similar phrasing.

Rosy retrospection is also related to the concept of [[declinism]].

==Experiments==
In one group of experiments, three groups going on different vacations were interviewed before, during, and after their vacations. Most followed the pattern of initially positive anticipation, followed by mild disappointment thereafter. Generally, most subjects reviewed the events more favorably some time after the events had occurred than they did while experiencing them.&lt;ref name="10.1006/jesp.1997.1333"/&gt;

{{Desalination}}
A '''seawater greenhouse''' is a [[greenhouse]] structure that enables the growth of crops in [[arid]] regions, using  [[seawater]] and [[solar energy]]. The technique involves pumping seawater (or allowing it to gravitate if below sea level) to an arid location and then subjecting it to two processes: first, it is used to humidify and cool the air, and second, it is evaporated by solar heating and [[distilled]] to produce [[fresh water]]. Finally, the remaining humidified air is expelled from the greenhouse and used to improve growing conditions for outdoor plants. The technology was introduced by British inventor Charlie Paton in the early 1990s and is being developed by his [[UK]] company Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The more concentrated salt water may either be further evaporated for the production of salt and other elements, or discharged back to the sea. The seawater greenhouse is a response to the global [[water crisis]] and [[peak water]].

== History ==
The seawater greenhouse concept was first researched and developed in 1991 by Charlie Paton's company Light Works Ltd, now Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The first pilot project commenced in 1992 with the search for a test site that was eventually found on the [[Canary Island]] of [[Tenerife]]. A prototype seawater greenhouse was assembled in the UK and constructed on the site in Tenerife. The results from this pilot project validated the concept and demonstrated the potential for other arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/0/wI6rFXzIVY0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original pilot design evolved into a lower cost solution using a lighter steel structure, similar to a multi-span polytunnel. This structure was designed to be cost effective and suitable for local sourcing. The design was first tested and validated through a second seawater greenhouse that was constructed on [[Al-Aryam Island]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229315021_The_seawater_greenhouse_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates_Thermal_modelling_and_evaluation_of_design_options|title = The Seawater Greenhouse in the United Arab Emirates: thermal modelling and evaluation of design options|journal = Desalination|volume = 173|pages=103-111|date = 2005|publisher = Elsevier|accessdate = 2015-11-03|author1=P.

These projects have enabled the validation of a thermodynamic simulation model which, given appropriate meteorological data, accurately predict and quantify how the seawater greenhouse
will perform in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=TechAwards&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/1/6NyDruLA3tY|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Seawater Greenhouse built a new commercial installation in [[Australia]]. The enterprise is now independently operating with an evolved set of technologies as [http://www.sundropfarms.com Sundrop Farms Pty Ltd]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/2/yY53De4kQ-Y|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/5/gzeBca4kJs0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process==
A seawater greenhouse uses the sun, the sea and the atmosphere to produce fresh water and
cool air. The process recreates the natural [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] within a controlled environment. The front wall of the building is a seawater evaporator. It consists of a [[honeycomb lattice]] and faces the prevailing wind. Fans control air movement. Seawater trickles down over the lattice, cooling and humidifying the air passing through into the planting area.
Sunlight is filtered through a specially constructed roof. The roof traps [[infrared]] heat, while allowing visible light through to promote photosynthesis. This creates optimum growing conditions – cool and humid with high light intensity. Seawater that has been heated in the roof passes through a second evaporator creating hot, saturated air which then flows through a condenser.
The condenser is cooled by incoming seawater. The temperature difference causes fresh water to condense out of the air stream. The volume of fresh water is determined by air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and the airflow rate. These conditions can be modeled with appropriate meteorological data, enabling the design and process to be optimized for any suitable location.

A seawater greenhouse evaporates much more water than it condenses back into freshwater. This humid air is `lost´ due to high rates of ventilation to keep the crops cool and supplied with CO2. The higher humidity exhaust air provides some benefit to the cultivation of more hardy crops downwind of the greenhouse.

This phenomenon could enable the cultivation of biofuel crops in the area surrounding the seawater greenhouse.

== Applicability ==
The technique is applicable to sites in arid regions near the sea. The distance and elevation from the sea must be evaluated considering the energy required to pump water to the site.  There are numerous suitable locations on the coasts; others are below sea level, such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Qattara Depression]], where hydro schemes have been proposed to exploit the hydraulic pressure to generate power, e.g., [[Red Sea-Dead Sea canal|Red Sea–Dead Sea Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0a.htm|title=Managing water for peace in the Middle East|website=archive.unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/pipe-headloss-power-calculator-calculate-how-much-energy-to-pump-seawater-to-the-middle-of-the-sahara-or-gobi-desert-for-desalination-in-the-seawater-greenhouse-answer-not-a-lot.html|title=Pipe Headloss &amp; Power calculator - calculate how much energy to pump seawater to the middle of the Sahara or Gobi Desert for desalination in the SeaWater Greenhouse - answer not a lot. - Claverton Group|website=www.claverton-energy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundrop Farms, Australia==
The seawater greenhouse technology was adopted and subsequently modified by [[Sundrop Farms]] in [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050057/http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |archive-date=2014-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Sundrop Farms uses a more robust desalination technique in favour of the water vapour technique employed by Seawater Greenhouse, thus allowing them to construct larger scale facilities.  This has been a success, allowing Sundrop Farms to grow crops such as tomatoes in arid climates with only the use of salt water and sunlight, which they use to produce heat, water, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/news/|title=Sundrop Farms - News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expansion of 20 hectares was [[Project commissioning|commissioned]] in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ing.dk/galleri/fotos-danske-solanlaeg-laver-17000-tons-australske-tomater-187362#0 |title=FOTOS: Danske solanlæg laver 17.000 tons australske tomater |work=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=7 October 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/facilities/|title=Facilities - Sundrop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S1ABanimated.gif|thumb|An illustration of the selection principle S1(A,B)]]
In mathematics, a '''selection principle''' is a rule asserting
the possibility of obtaining mathematically significant objects by 
selecting elements from given sequences of sets. The theory of '''selection principles'''
studies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties.
Selection principles mainly describe covering properties, 
measure- and category-theoretic properties, and local properties in 
topological spaces, especially function spaces. Often, the 
characterization of a mathematical property using a selection 
principle is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the 
characterized property.

==The main selection principles==
In 1924, [[Karl Menger]]
&lt;ref name="Karl Menger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|
title=Einige Überdeckungssätze der punktmengenlehre|
journal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|
pages=421–444|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-6110-4_14|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: 
Every basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing 
diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, 
[[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurewicz|first1=Witold|
title=Über eine verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|
journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|date=1926|volume=24.1|pages=401–421|
url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01216792|doi=10.1007/bf01216792}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed that Menger's basis property is equivalent to the 
following selective property: for every sequence of open covers of the space, 
one can select finitely many open sets from each cover in the sequence, such that the selected sets cover the space.
Topological spaces having this covering property are called '''Menger spaces'''.

Hurewicz's reformulation of Menger's property was the first important 
topological property described by a selection principle. 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; be classes of mathematical objects.
In 1996, [[Marion Scheepers]]&lt;ref name=coc1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion|
title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|
journal=Topology and its Applications|date=1996|volume=69|pages=31–62|
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following selection hypotheses,
capturing a large number of classic mathematical properties:

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where the classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; consist of covers of some ambient space, Scheepers also introduced the following selection principle.

* &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, none containing a finite subcover, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2,\dotsc\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, [[Boaz Tsaban]] identified the prevalence of the following related principle:
*&lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}}&lt;/math&gt;: Every member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains a member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions thus defined are ''selection principles''. An instantiation of a selection principle, by considering specific classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, gives a ''selection (or: selective) property''. However, these terminologies are used interchangeably in the literature.

===Variations===

For a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the '''star of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the set &lt;math&gt;\text{St}(A,\mathcal{F})=\bigcup\{F\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap F\neq\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1999, [[Ljubisa D.R. Kocinac]] introduced the following ''star selection principles'':&lt;ref name=Kssp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kocinac|first1=Ljubisa D. R.|
title=Star selection principles: a survey|
journal=Khayyam Journal of Mathematics|date=2015|volume=1|pages=82–106|
url=http://emis.de/journals/KJM/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(U_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(\bigcup \mathcal{F}_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Covering properties==

Covering properties form the kernel of the theory of selection principles.  Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}&lt;/math&gt;. (Formally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, but usually the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C&lt;math&gt;''&lt;/math&gt; space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-cover''' if every finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. The class of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[γ-space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega}}{\mathbf{\Gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;), '''star-Rothberger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;).

===The Scheepers Diagram===
There are 36 selection properties of the form &lt;math&gt; \Pi(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\Pi\in\{\text{S}_1, \text{S}_\text{fin},\text{U}_\text{fin}, \bigl(~~\bigr)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\{\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{\Omega}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some of them are trivial (hold for all spaces, or fail for all spaces). Restricting attention to [[Lindelöf space]]s, the diagram below, known as the ''Scheepers Diagram'',&lt;ref name=coc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2|last1=Just|first1=Winfried}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents nontrivial selection properties of the above form, and every nontrivial selection property is equivalent to one in the diagram.  Arrows denote implications.

==Local properties==

Selection principles also capture important non-covering properties.

Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that have the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in their closure is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the ''countable'' elements of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sequences in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that converge to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma_y}&lt;/math&gt;.

* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Gamma_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|strongly Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Gamma_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable strong fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological Games==

There are close connections between selection principles and [[topological game|Topological Games]].

===The Menger game===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Menger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game for two players, Alice and Bob.  It has an inning per each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  At the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; inning, Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,
and Bob chooses a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  
If the family &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A '''strategy''' for a player is a function determining the move of the player, given the earlier moves of both players. A strategy for a player is a '''winning strategy''' if each play where this player sticks to this strategy is won by this player.

* A topological space is &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on this space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc1" /&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Bob has a winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Marion|date=1995-01-01|title=A direct proof of a theorem of Telgársky|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1995-123-11/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1/|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume=123|issue=11|pages=3483–3485|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1|issn=0002-9939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telgársky|first=Rastislav|date=1984-06-01|title=On games of Topsoe.|url=http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/12050|journal=MATHEMATICA SCANDINAVICA|volume=54|issue=0|pages=170–176|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-12050|issn=1903-1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar way, we define games for other selection principles from the given Scheepers Diagram. In all these cases a topological space has a property from the Scheepers Diagram if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the corresponding game.&lt;ref name="pawlikowski"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=Janusz|title=Undetermined sets of point-open games|url=https://eudml.org/doc/212029|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=144|issue=3|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsets of the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the induced [[subspace topology]]) holding selection principle properties, most notably Menger and Hurewicz spaces, can be characterized by their continuous images in the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition of size asymmetry ==

Resource competition can vary from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size, known also as [[scramble competition]]) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter θ in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes Bj.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwinning Fox 1995"&gt;Schwinning, S. &amp; Fox, G. A. Population-dynamic consequences of competitive symmetry in annual plants. Oikos 72, 422-432, [[doi:10.2307/3546128]] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{#tag:math|r_i=r(B_i)^\theta}}
{{#tag:math|/\sum_{j=1}^{n}(B_j)^\theta}}

ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j. When θ =1, competition is perfectly size symmetric, e.g. if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor, the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource (i.e. both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit). When θ &gt;1 competition is size-asymmetric, e.g.  if large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor and θ =2, the large individual will acquire four times the amount of that resource (i.e. the large individual will exploit twice the amount of resource per biomass unit). As θ increases, competition becomes more size-asymmetric and larger plants get larger amounts of resource per unit biomass compared with smaller plants.

== Differences in size-asymmetry among resources in plant communities ==

Competition among plants for [[light]] is size-asymmetric because of the directionality of its supply.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1990"/&gt; Higher [[leaves]] shade lower leaves but not vice versa.  Competition for [[nutrients]] appears to be relatively size-symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, G. M. &amp; Wayne, P. M. Characterizing the size dependence of resource acquisition within crowded plant populations. Ecology 81, 1072-1085, [[doi:10.1890/0012-9658]](2000)081[1072:ctsdor]2.0.co;2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been hypothesized that a patchy distribution of nutrients in the soil may lead to size-asymmetry in competition among roots.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, T. K. Evidence for size asymmetry of belowground competition. Basic and Applied Ecology 4, 239-247, doi:10.1078/1439-1791-00151 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing is known about the size-asymmetry of competition for [[water]].&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;

Herbivores and nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation. Nature 508, 517-520, [[doi:10.1038/nature13144]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a debate whether this phenomenon is related to the size-asymmetry of light competition&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016"/&gt; or to other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Harpole, W. S. &amp; Tilman, D. Grassland species loss resulting from reduced niche dimension. Nature 446, 791-793, [[doi:10.1038/nature05684]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting assumptions about size-asymmetry characterise the two leading and competing theories in plant ecology,&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016" /&gt; the [[R* rule|R* theory]] and the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR theory]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size-symmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to withstand low level of resources (known as the [[R* rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. Resource competition and community structure. Monographs in population biology 17, 1-296 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to grow fast and attain a large size.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. Evidence for existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory. American Naturalist 111, 1169-1194 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Size-asymmetric competition affects also several [[evolutionary]] processes in relation to trait selection. Evolution of plant height is highly affected by asymmetric light competition.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"&gt;Tilman, D. Plant strategies and the dynamics and structure of plant communities. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 360. p. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"&gt;Falster, D. S. &amp; Westoby, M. Plant height and evolutionary games.

Water availability predicts forest canopy height at the global scale. Ecology Letters 18, 1311-1320, [[doi:10.1111/ele.12525]] (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; presumably due to increase in the relative importance of size-asymmetric competition for light. Similarly, investment in the size of seeds at the expense of their number may be more effective undersize-asymmetric resource competition, since larger seeds tend to produce larger seedlings that are better competitors.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"&gt;Falster, D. S., Moles, A. T. &amp; Westoby, M. A general model for the scaling of offspring size and adult size. American Naturalist 172, 299-317, [[doi:10.1086/589889]] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Size-asymmetric competition can be exploited in managing plant communities, such as the suppression of [[weed]] in [[crop]] fields.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"/&gt;  Weeds are a greater problem for farmer in dry than in moist environments, in large part because crops can suppress weeds much more effectively undersize-asymmetric competition for light than under more size-symmetric competition below ground.

'''Spatial visualization ability''' or '''visual-spatial ability''' is the ability to mentally manipulate [[Two dimensional|2-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] figures.  It is typically measured with simple [[cognitive test]]s and is predictive of user performance with some kinds of [[user interface]]s.

== Measurement ==
The cognitive tests used to measure spatial visualization ability including [[mental rotation]] tasks like the [[Mental Rotations Test]] or  mental cutting tasks like the [[Mental Cutting Test]]; and [[cognitive tests]] like the VZ-1 (Form Board), VZ-2 (Paper Folding), and VZ-3 (Surface Development) tests from the Kit of Factor-Reference cognitive tests produced by [[Educational Testing Service]].  Though the descriptions of spatial visualization and mental rotation sound similar, mental rotation is a particular task that can be accomplished using spatial visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=J.|last2=Kent|first2=L.|year=2003|title=Apparency of contingencies in single panel and pull-down menus|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=49|issue=1|pages=59–78|doi=10.1006/ijhc.1998.0200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Paper Form Board Test|Form Board test]] involves giving participants a shape and a set of smaller shapes which they are then instructed to determine which combination of small shapes will fill the larger shape completely without overlapping. The Paper Folding test involves showing participants a sequence of folds in a piece of paper, through which a set of holes is then punched. The participants must choose which of a set of unfolded papers with holes corresponds to the one they have just seen.

The Surface Development test involves giving participants a flat shape with numbered sides and a three-dimensional shape with lettered sides and asking the participants to indicate which numbered side corresponds to which lettered side.

According to certain studies, men on average have one standard deviation higher spatial intelligence quotient than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Michèle|last2=Chevrier|first2=Eliane|date=October 2003|title=Does men's advantage in mental rotation persist when real three-dimensional objects are either felt or seen?|journal=[[Memory &amp; Cognition]]|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1136–1145|doi=10.3758/BF03196134|issn=0090-502X|pmid=14704028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This domain is one of the few where clear [[Sex and intelligence|sex differences in cognition]] appear. Researchers at the [[University of Toronto]] say that differences between men and women on some tasks that require spatial skills are largely eliminated after both groups play a video game for only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Jing|last2=Spence|first2=Ian|last3=Pratt|first3=Jay|date=2016-05-06|title=Playing an Action Video Game Reduces Gender Differences in Spatial Cognition|journal=[[Psychological Science]]|language=en|volume=18|issue=10|pages=850–855|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01990.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.392.9474|pmid=17894600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Herman Witkin]] had claimed women are more "visually dependent" than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality through perception: An experimental and clinical study|last=Witkin|first=H.

Other studies suggest gender differences in spatial thinking may be explained by a [[stereotype threat]] effect. The fear of fulfilling stereotypes negatively affects the performance which results in a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGlone|first=Matthew S.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua|title=Stereotype threat, identity salience, and spatial reasoning|journal=[[Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology]]|volume=27|issue=5|pages=486–493|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2006.06.003|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive significance, if any, of male superiority in spatial navigation has been questioned. A 2012 study suggests that male superiority in spatial navigation is more likely derived from hormonal differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clint|first=Edward K.|last2=Sober|first2=Elliott|last3=Garland|first3=Theodore|last4=Rhodes|first4=Justin S.|date=2013|title=Male Superiority in Spatial Navigation: Adaptation or Side Effect?|journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]|volume=87|issue=4|pages=289–313|doi=10.1086/668168|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age differences ==
Older adults tend to perform worse on measures of spatial visualization ability than younger adults, and this effect seems to occur even among people who use spatial visualization frequently on the job, such as [[architect]]s and [[Surveying|surveyors]] (though they still perform better on the measures than others of the same age). It is, however, possible that the types of spatial visualization used by architects are not measured accurately by the tests.{{Which|date=January 2015}}

== History ==
The construct of spatial visualization ability was first identified as separate from general intelligence in the 20th Century, and its implications for computer system design were identified in the 1980s.

In 1987, [[Kim Vicente]] and colleagues ran a battery of cognitive tests on a set of participants and then determined which cognitive abilities correlated with performance on a computerized information search task.  They found that the only significant predictors of performance were [[vocabulary]] and spatial visualization ability, and that those with high spatial visualization ability were twice as fast to perform the task as those with lower levels of spatial visualization ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vicente|first=K.

In mathematics, a '''unitary spider diagram''' adds existential points to an [[Euler diagram|Euler]] or a [[Venn diagram]]. The points indicate the existence of an attribute described by the intersection of contours in the Euler diagram. These points may be joined together forming a shape like a [[spider]]. Joined points represent an "or" condition, also known as a [[logical disjunction]].

A '''spider diagram''' is a boolean expression involving unitary spider diagrams and the logical symbols &lt;math&gt;\land,\lor,\lnot&lt;/math&gt;. For example, it may consist of the conjunction of two spider diagrams, the disjunction of two spider diagrams, or the negation of a spider diagram.

== Example ==
[[Image:SpiderEuler.jpg|thumb|275px|Logical disjunction superimposed on Euler diagram]]
In the image shown, the following conjunctions
: &lt;math&gt;A \land B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B \land C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F \land E&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;G \land F&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[universe of discourse]] defined by this [[Euler diagram]], in addition to the conjunctions specified above, all possible sets from ''A'' through ''B'' and ''D'' through ''G'' are available separately. The set ''C'' is only available as a subset of ''B''. Often, in complicated diagrams, [[singleton set]]s and/or conjunctions may be obscured by other set combinations.

The two spiders in the example correspond to the following logical expressions:
* Red spider: &lt;math&gt;(F \land E) \lor (G) \lor (D)&lt;/math&gt;
*Blue spider: &lt;math&gt;(A) \lor (C \land B) \lor (F)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[celestial mechanics]], the term '''stationary orbit''' refers to an orbit around a planet or moon where the orbiting satellite or [[spacecraft]] remains orbiting over the same spot on the surface. From the ground, the satellite would appear to be standing still, hovering above the surface in the same spot, day after day.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;
   "Space Today Online - Answers To Your Questions",
   Spacetoday.org, 2010, webpage:
   [http://www.spacetoday.org/Questions/PolarSats.html ST-Sats].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this is accomplished by matching the rotation of the surface below, by reaching a particular altitude where the orbital speed almost matches the rotation below, in an equatorial orbit.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; As the speed decreases slowly, then an additional boost would be needed to increase the speed back to a matching speed, or a [[retro-rocket]] could be fired to slow the speed when too fast. 

The stationary-orbit region of space is known as the [[Clarke Belt]], named after British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]], who published the idea in ''[[Wireless World]]'' magazine in 1945.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; A stationary orbit is sometimes referred to as a "fixed orbit".

==Stationary Earth orbit==
{{main|Geostationary orbit}}
Around the [[Earth]], stationary satellites orbit at altitudes of approximately {{convert|22,300|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; Writing in 1945, the science-fiction author [[Arthur C. Clarke]] imagined [[communications satellite]]s as travelling in stationary orbits, where those satellites would travel around the Earth at the same speed the globe is spinning, making them hover stationary over one spot on the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

A satellite being propelled into place, into a stationary orbit, is first fired to a special equatorial orbit called a "[[geostationary transfer orbit]]" (GTO).&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; Within this oval-shaped ([[elliptical]]) orbit, the satellite will alternately swing out to {{convert|22,300|mi|km|-1}} high and then back down to an altitude of only {{convert|100|mi|km}} above the Earth (223 times closer). Then, at a planned time and place, an attached "kick motor" will push the satellite out to maintain an even, circular orbit at the 22,300-mile altitude.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

==Stationary Mars orbit==
{{main|areostationary orbit}}
An ''areostationary orbit'' or ''areosynchronous equatorial orbit'' (abbreviated ''AEO'') is a circular [[areosynchronous orbit|areo&amp;shy;synchronous orbit]] in the [[Mars|Martian]] [[equator|equatorial plane]] about {{convert|20428|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface, any point on which revolves about Mars in the same direction and with the same [[orbital period|period]] as the Martian surface. Areo&amp;shy;stationary orbit is a concept similar to Earth's [[geostationary orbit|geo&amp;shy;stationary orbit]]. The prefix ''areo-'' derives from [[Ares]], the ancient Greek god of war and counterpart to the Roman god Mars, with whom the planet was identified. The modern Greek word for Mars is {{lang|el|Άρης}} ({{transl|el|Áris}}).

The '''ten realms''', sometimes referred to as the ''ten worlds'',&lt;ref&gt;Junjirō Takakusu: The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy, Motilal Barnasidass, Dehli 1998, pp. 143-145.  {{ISBN|81-208-1592-0}} (Ten realms in Tiantai/Tendai)&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the  belief of some forms of [[Buddhism]] that there are ten conditions of life which sentient beings are subject to, and which they experience from moment to moment.

The ten realms are part of [[Buddhist cosmology]] and consist of four higher realms and six lower realms  derived from the Indian concept of [[Bhavacakra#Third_layer:_the_six_realms_of_samsara|the six realms of rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lopez|first1=Donald S.|title=The "Lotus Sūtra": A Biography Lives of Great Religious Books|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400883349|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTL9CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22ten+realms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgwqLEpazXAhXFeCYKHXmJDFsQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20realms%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These realms can also be described through the degrees of enlightenment that course through them.&lt;ref name="Arai 1893"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arai|first1=Nissatsu|title=Outlines of the Doctrine of the Nichiren Sect, Submitted to the Parliament of the World's Religions|date=1893|publisher=Central Office of the Nichiren Sect|location=Tokyo, Japan|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WE0uAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdid=book-WE0uAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdot=1|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been translated in various ways.  They are divided into the Six Realms (六道), followed by higher states of enlightened consciousness that lead to final Buddhahood. The Six Realms are: [[Naraka_(Buddhism)|Hell]] (地獄道), the Hungry Ghosts or [[preta]]s (餓鬼道), the [[Animals_in_Buddhism|Beasts]] (畜生道), the Titans or [[Asura_(Buddhism)|Asuras]] (修羅道), Humans (人道) and lastly Heaven, or the realm of the gods (天道). Above these lie the four holy states: the [[Śrāvaka]] (声聞), the [[Pratyekabuddha]] (縁覚), the [[bodhisattva]] (菩薩) and finally completely enlightened [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref name="Japan Library"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=Collected writings of Carmen Blacker|date=2000|publisher=Japan Library|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=9781873410929|pages=186–199|edition=Transferred to digital printing.|chapter=16: Initiation in the Shugendo: The passage through the ten states of existence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some systems of cosmology these states are perceived as distinct realms in which the inhabitant has to experience various forms of suffering in order to expiate karma.  In [[Shugendō|Japanese syncretic practices]] the ten realms are seen as distinct trials of discipline a practitioner must encounter or overcome in order to reach a material or spiritual goal.&lt;ref name="Japan Library"/&gt;

However, according to [[Zhiyi|Chih-i's]] conceptualization of [[Zhiyi#Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life|"three thousand realms in a single moment of life,"]] they are not separate physical realms into which one may be reborn but interrelated realms of consciousness, each of which is contained within each other (Jp. jikkai gogu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowring|first1=Richard|title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500-1600|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521851190|page=123|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzeODCVG26UC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=jikkai+distinct+realms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGzIKji5nXAhXmx4MKHb7ZB8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jikkai%20distinct%20realms&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ten Realms are a conceptualization of the [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sutra's]] worldview of the interconnected relationship of phenomena, the ultimate reality of the universe, and human agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ikeda|first1=Daisaku|title=Unlocking the mysteries of birth &amp; death : &amp; everything in between, a Buddhist view of life|date=2003|publisher=Middleway|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=9780972326704|pages=106–107|edition=2nd|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_QBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=nichiren+%22ten+worlds%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcmZ7n8pjXAhVDxoMKHU65Dc8Q6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20worlds%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anesaki 1916"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anesaki|first1=Masaharu|title=Nichiren, the Buddhist Prophet|date=1916|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9781498186582|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ub0KAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PR3|pages=150-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three thousand realms in a single moment ==

Each of the ten realms or worlds are contained within each realm, the "mutual possession of the ten realms" (Jap. ''jikkai gogu'').  The one subsequent hundred worlds are viewed through the lenses of the [[Ten suchnesses]] and the three realms of existence (Jpn. ''san-seken'') to formulate three thousand realms of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|lay-url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51961656|title=The Soka Gakkai dictionary of buddhism|date=2002|publisher=Soka Gakkai|others=Sōka Gakkai., 創価学会.|isbn=9784412012059|location=Tokyo|oclc=5196165|url=http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/T/165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hundred aspects of existence leads to the concept of "''three thousand realms in a single moment'' (Jap.

According to this conception, the world of Buddha and the nine realms of humanity are interpenetrable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimazono|first1=Susumu|editor1-last=Takeuchi|editor1-first=Yoshinori|title=Buddhist spirituality: later China, Korea, Japan, and the modern world|date=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120819443|page=445|chapter=29: Soka Gakkai and the Modern Reformation of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXMBhF_lhk8C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=9788120819443&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjku8eSnp3XAhWo7oMKHUT6CHgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soka%20gakkai&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no original "pure mind," and good and evil are mutually possessed.&lt;ref name="Stone 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Jacqueline I.|title=Original enlightenment and the transformation of medieval Japanese Buddhism|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824827717|page=179|edition=Pbk.|quote=The mutual encompassing or copenetration of the ten realms (jikkai gogu) collapses any ontological distinction between the Buddha and the beings, implying that the nine realms of unenlightened beings possess the Buddha nature inherently, while the Buddha possesses the nine realms of unenlightened beings.

The most depraved icchantika is endowed the Buddha realm, while the Buddha is still latently endowed with the realms of unenlightened beings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This establishes a proclivity to immanence rather than transcendency.  According to [[Nichiren]] the three thousand realms in a single moment is practical and realizable in this lifetime in the concrete world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=See|first1=Tony|editor1-last=Bogue|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Chiu|editor2-first=Hanping|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Yu-lin|title=Deleuze and Asia|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443868884|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TFQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=nichiren&amp;f=false|chapter=2: Deleuze and Mahayana Buddhism: Immanence and Original Enlightenment Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paradoxes of the Infinite''''' (German title: ''Paradoxien des Unendlichen'') is a mathematical work by [[Bernard Bolzano]] on the theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It was published by a friend and student, [[František Přihonský]], in 1851, three years after Bolzano's death. The work contained many interesting results in [[set theory]]. Bolzano expanded on the theme of [[Galileo's paradox]], giving more examples of correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and [[proper subset]]s of infinite sets. In the work he also explained the term ''Menge'', rendered in English as "set", which he had coined and used in several works since the 1830s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17848">In [[Scientology]], the concept of the '''thetan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|eɪ|t|ən}}) is similar to the concept of [[self]], or the [[spirit]] or [[soul]] as found in several other [[Religion|belief systems]]. The term is derived from the Greek letter Θ, [[theta]], which in [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology beliefs]] represents "the source of life, or life itself."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;  In Scientology it is believed that it is the thetan, not the [[central nervous system]], which commands the body through communication points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_5.HTM |title=Nerve Assist&amp;nbsp;– Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Scientologyhandbook.org |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans have been described in the [[Church of Scientology]] in a number of ways.
* A "thetan is an immortal spiritual being; the human soul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/chp50/pg1024-a.html#thetan Official Glossary of Scientology &amp; Dianetics Terms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112091124/http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/chp50/pg1024-a.html#thetan |date=November 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The being who is the individual and who handles and lives in the body."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|title=Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary|publisher=Bridge Publications|date=June 1975|isbn=0-88404-037-2|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A thetan is not a thing, a thetan is the creator of things."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;
* A thetan is "the person himself—not his body or his name, the physical universe, his mind, or anything else; that which is aware of being aware; the identity which is the individual. The thetan is most familiar to one and all as ''you''."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;

According to the [[Church of Scientology]], the concept for the thetan was first discovered in the early 1950s by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], drawing on reports by [[Dianetics]] practitioners of [[Reincarnation|past-life experiences]]. Although the term is comparable to a soul, a thetan can be connected to multiple people over time. An important goal in Scientology is to become one with the thetan as an [[Operating Thetan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaefer |first1=Richard T. |last2=Zellner |first2=William W. |title=Extraordinary Groups: An Examination of Unconventional Lifestyles |publisher=Macmillan |year=2010 |accessdate=2016-03-07 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iniuCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thetan in Scientology doctrine==
The term and concept were defined by Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], who adopted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[theta]] (Θ) to represent "the source of life and life itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Science of Survival'', L. Ron Hubbard pg.3 pub. Publications Organization {{ISBN|0-88404-001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard first introduced his ideas of "theta-beings" in a lecture series of March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientology: Milestone One'', L. Ron Hubbard pub. Golden Era Productions. Audio lectures with transcripts&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed the coining of the word to his wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''The Auditor'' 21, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; As an essential point of Scientology doctrine, a person's identity and self-awareness come entirely from a "thetan". It is redundant to refer to "a person's thetan," because the person does not exist independently.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Scientology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creed of the Church of Scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard once defined a thetan as: "...&amp;nbsp;having no mass, no wave-length, no energy, no measurable qualities and no time or location in space except by consideration or postulate. The spirit is not a thing. It is the creator of things."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt; In a lecture series later published as a book ("The Phoenix Lectures"), he jokingly pointed to a study that implied that a "thetan" manifests a small but measurable amount of mass:

:"From some experiments conducted about fifteen or twenty years ago—a thetan weighed about 1.5&amp;nbsp;ounces {{interp|45&amp;nbsp;grams}}! Who made these experiments? Well, a doctor made these experiments. He weighed people before and after death, retaining any mass. He weighed the person, bed and all, and he found that the weight dropped at the moment of death about 1.5&amp;nbsp;ounces {{interp|45&amp;nbsp;grams}} and some of them 2&amp;nbsp;ounces [60&amp;nbsp;grams]. (Those were super thetans!)"&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''The Phoenix Lectures'', p. 147. Bridge Publications, 1982 {{ISBN|0-88404-006-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hubbard did not name the doctor concerned, there was indeed such an attempt, by [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]], to measure the weight of dying patients to determine the weight of the soul, although MacDougall's [[21 grams experiment|experiments]] took place about fifty years before Hubbard's lectures, not fifteen or twenty, and are generally not regarded as having any scientific validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hubbard's son [[Ronald DeWolf]] (born L. Ron Hubbard Jr.), his father stated that thetans are immortal and perpetual, having willed themselves into existence at some point several trillion&lt;ref name=bill&gt;Billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]&lt;/ref&gt; years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/batchild1/transcript/pbs1.htm|title=''PBS Late Night'' interview with Ron DeWolf|work=members.cox.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108071658/http://members.cox.net/batchild1/transcript/pbs1.htm|archivedate=2006-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Joseph M., ''Is L. Ron Hubbard Dead?'', [[Christianity Today]], 18 February 1983, p 31&lt;/ref&gt; After they originated, thetans generated "points to view" or "dimension points", causing space to come into existence. They agreed that other thetans' dimension points existed, thus bringing into existence the entire universe. All matter, energy, space, and time exists solely because thetans ''agree'' that it exists.

In the primordial past, according to Scientologist teachings, thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.."&lt;ref name=Neusner&gt;{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|year=2003|title=World Religions in America|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=221–236|isbn=0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is thought to have no independent reality, but to derive its apparent reality from the fact that most thetans agree it exists.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book | last = Chryssides  | first = George D.  | authorlink = George D. Chryssides  | title = Exploring New Religions  | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]  | date = 1999  | location =   | page = 283  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-8264-5959-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists believe that thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation, rather than their original state of spiritual purity.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Eventually, they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans are believed to be reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called "assumption" which is analogous to [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Dell deChant and [[Danny Jorgensen]] liken Scientology to [[Hinduism]], in that both ascribe a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; With each rebirth, the effects of the "MEST" universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan are believed to become stronger.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Scientologists believe that the thetan has been “embodied on many occasions,” but they generally avoid the term “reincarnation.” They also reject the idea of transmigration, “i.e. the belief that the thetan would incarnate into any animal less than human.” Scientology’s first phase has to do with removing “encumbrances acquired in this life and in past existences,” J. Gordon Melton writes. These encumbrances are called “engrams,” “described as aberrations attached to the self that produce dysfunctional behavior patterns,” according to Melton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Atack]], whose book ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'' details how he reached [[Operating Thetan]] level V before leaving Scientology, describes Hubbard's doctrines about thetans:  "Thetans are all-knowing beings, and became bored because there were no surprises. Hubbard asserted that the single most important desire in all beings is to have a '[[game (Scientology)|game]]'. To have a 'game' it was necessary to 'not know' certain things, so certain perceptions were negated ('not-is-ed')."  Since thetans knew everything, this required them to abandon or suppress perceptions and knowledge. Over time, the loss of perception accumulated and certain thetans began to cause harm to others. MEST (physical) beings also sought to "trap" thetans in order to control them. Thetans came to learn contrition, punishing themselves for their own "harmful" acts.&lt;ref name=APoBS&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 9.2 --&gt;

According to Hubbard, an essential part of the thetans' game was the "conquest" of matter, energy, space, and time by the life force, theta. This has produced multiple universes which have ended and begun in succession, each new one being more solid and entrapping than the last. The thetans have by now become so enmeshed in the physical universe that many have identified themselves totally with it, forgetting their quadrillions&lt;ref name=thbill&gt;Thousands of billions in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]&lt;/ref&gt; of years of existence and their original godly powers.&lt;ref name=APoBS/&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 9.2 --&gt;

According to Scientology, thetan powers are said to remain potent and restorable. One of the Church of Scientology's stated goals is "the rehabilitation of the human spirit", by which it means the restoration of the thetan's original abilities. Hubbard claims that thetans are able to change reality through "postulates"—decisions made by the individual about the nature of the reality around them. Some thetans are said to have (mis)used this ability to "implant" others with hypnotic suggestions, forcing other thetans to "cluster" around bodies (hence [[body thetan]]s). This sort of directed control is referred to as "other-determinism". Scientology seeks to undo it and return the thetan to "self-determinism", where he can control himself and his environment. The eventual goal is to achieve "pan-determinism", where he acts for the good of all.

The Scientological notion of the thetan differs from other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, in three significant ways. While other belief systems “fuse the concept of the body and soul”, the thetan is “separate and independent.” Also unlike the Judeo-Christian tradition, Scientologists believe that the thetan has “lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes.” Third, different from the Christian notion of original sin, Scientology believes that the thetan is basically good, but “has lost touch with its true nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |last2=Bromley |first2=David G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_xgBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=scientology+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjexaC03ObMAhWBbCYKHQDGBoc4ChDoAQg_MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20religion&amp;f=false |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History, Wiley Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2015 |isbn=9781118722107 |accessdate=2016-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Richard Holloway writes that thetans were not created, but they created themselves, adopting and creating the human body as a vehicle or existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thetans and death==
Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos described in a 1990 article in the ''LA Times'' how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a "landing station" on the planet [[Venus]], where the thetan is [[Implant (Scientology)|re-implanted]] and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, "capsule" it, and send it back to Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set. And if you can find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you're OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Joel | last=Sappell |author2=Welkos, Robert W.  | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientologysidea062490,1,5476601,full.story?coll=la-news-comment | title=Defining the Theology | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | page=A36:1 | date=1990-06-24 | accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-1b.html|title=The Scientology Story&amp;nbsp;– Part 1B: Defining the Theology|work=cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cempa, Joe; "Petrolia's New Neighbors", ''North Coast Journal'', June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hubbard’s discovery of the thetan led to the development of an elaborate cosmology, the doctrinal structure he created is based on the following propositions: “Man is an immortal spiritual being. His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first1=Eugene V. |title=The New Religious Movements Experience in America |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating Thetan==
{{Main|Operating Thetan}}

According to Scientology doctrine, a thetan exists whether operating a human body or not. Scientology advertises itself as being able to "rehabilitate" the thetan of a practitioner to a state where the individual can operate with or without a "[[Scientology and sex#MEST and flesh|flesh body]]". The term "operating thetan" would then apply as it does when an individual is operating a body. The Operating Thetan (OT) levels are the upper level courses in Scientology.

The Church defines "Operating Thetan" as "knowing and willing cause over [[life]], [[thought]], and [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]] ([[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]])."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard's Congress Lectures: Glossary, [http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#ot "OT"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117035746/http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#ot |date=2006-01-17 }}, Bridge Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology states as a point of doctrine that an individual exists with or without a body.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology, [http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/catechism/pg008.html Scientology Beliefs], accessed 03/28/06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleared Theta Clear==
Even beyond the Operating Thetan levels comes the "Cleared Theta Clear", a godlike state which Hubbard describes this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move MEST and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Scientology 8-8008'', pg 114 (1st ed), pg. 151 (1990 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Body thetan==
{{Main|Body thetan}}

A body thetan is a disincarnate thetan who is "stuck" in, on or near a human body, and all human bodies are said to be infested by these disembodied thetans, or clusters of them. This information is not revealed until a Scientologist reaches Section III of the Operating Thetan levels (commonly referred to as "OT III"). Body thetans were said by Hubbard to be a result of a prehistoric [[Incident (Scientology)|"Incident"]] involving [[Xenu]].

{{Jewish feminism}}
'''Women of the Wall''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נשות הכותל, ''Neshot HaKotel'') is a multi-denominational feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=644}}: "The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists."&lt;/ref&gt; organization based in [[Israel]] whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the [[Western Wall]], also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the [[Torah]] and wearing religious garments (''[[tallit]]'', ''[[tefillin]]'' and ''[[kippah]]''). Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that place "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of those restrictions is that the Rabbi of the Western Wall has enforced gender segregation and limitations on religious garb worn by women.  When the "Women of the Wall" hold monthly prayer services for women on [[Rosh Hodesh]], they observe gender segregation so that Orthodox members may fully participate.  But their use of religious garb, singing and reading from a Torah have upset some members of the Orthodox Jewish community, sparking protests and arrests. In May 2013 a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html|title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=December 25, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-western-wall-prayer.html|title=Israel Approves Prayer Space at Western Wall for Non-Orthodox Jews|date=1 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]] in deference to the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-facing-crisis-as-Haredim-vow-to-quit-over-Western-Wall-pluralism-447102 Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism]. The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sales |first=Ben |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/26/suspension-of-western-wall-deal-leaves-jewish-leaders-feeling-betrayed/ |title=Suspension of Western Wall deal leaves Jewish leaders feeling betrayed – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2017-06-26 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/06/25/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/netanyahu-rescinds-pluralistic-western-wall-agreement |title=Israel freezes Western Wall compromise that was to create egalitarian prayer section &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronit Kampf, the group's struggle has been "the most covered women's issue in the history of the Israeli media."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haberman|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Western Wall before sunset.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western Wall (August 2012)]]
From the start, Women of the Wall included Orthodox members and opted to run their service according to "Orthodox standards." Nevertheless, some Orthodox individuals were offended, including some who call themselves Orthodox feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|p=184}}: "A third reason for choosing Orthodox services was out awareness that if we did not adopt Orthodox standards, Orthodox women would not attend our services or, in all likelihood, support our struggle. Non-Orthodox women who have been involved in the Kotel struggle have been most generous in allowing Orthodox practice to prevail, and our services at the Kotel as well as the solidarity services we sponsored elsewhere therefore have been conducted in accordance with Orthodox standards. Despite this many Orthodox women, even those who were active in women's ''tefillah'' groups and leaders of Orthodox feminism, remained reticent and ambivalent about our struggle to pray at the Kotel, and Orthodox rabbis, even those who permitted women's ''tefillah'' their synagogues, did not support our right to pray in an identical fashion at the Kotel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "The movement, which is controversial, even among Orthodox feminists, myself included..."&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational group, including Reform, Conservative and Orthodox members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.679974 Amid Violence, Women of the Wall Vote Not to Engage Police This Month] Haaretz, Oct 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the group has faced a legal battle for recognition of their right to pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the [[Fast of Esther]] 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults at the women, which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, police arrested two [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a ''tallit''. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from the Orthodox also stems from Halachic concerns and from a general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a ''[[minyan]]'' (prayer quorum) and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|Young|1999|p=207}}: "Known as "the Women of the Wall," these women, out of deference to the group's Orthodox members, have used traditional liturgical texts and have not considered themselves to be a ''minyan''. Halakhically, at least as understood by Orthodoxy, women cannot constitute or count as members of a prayer quorum. Nonetheless, they have become the target of great opposition and occasional violence from ultra Orthodox Jews. [...] Women of the Wall continue to face opposition from ultra Orthodox Jews who are against women's prayer groups in general.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|Rubio-Marin|2005|p=214}}: "The Women of the Wall organization represents a group of observant Jewish women who pray together in a ''minyan'' -  a religious quorum traditionally reserved for men. This form of collective worship is not acceptable to ultra-Orthodox Jews when practiced by women."&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambré|2002|p=12}}: "But, at the kotel, where tradition trumps individual choice, the guidelines have not changed because they are not only a matter of acknowledging the desires of this group, which itself would radically alter Jewish tradition, but because the group lacks the support of any major religious authority. At the same time, acceding to their requests might also mean giving parity to non-Orthodox denominations."&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters highlighted the fact that only in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "Supporters of the Women of the Wall note the irony that "only in Israel, and at the site most holy to Jews...are Jewish women prohibited from praying aloud in a group with a Torah."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|2005|p=552}}: "In 2003, the Women of the Wall, a group of more than 100 Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform women, lost their 14-year legal battle to hold formal women's prayer services at the Western Wall. The High Court ruled that the group could not hold prayer services at the Western Wall and instead would be permitted to hold them at nearby Robinson's Arch."&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 2013.

Some Orthodox feminist organisations have voiced support for their right to pray at the Kotel.&lt;ref name=Maltz0613&gt;{{cite news|last=Maltz|first=Judy|title= The new Orthodox face of Women of the Wall|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/the-new-orthodox-face-of-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.516416/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=April 19, 2013}}: "Although Women of the Wall is widely associated with the Reform movement, it is very much based on an Orthodox model, says Elana Sztokman, the executive director of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, an international organization based in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was created by Jewish women, including some from the diaspora,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}: "Initiated in 1988 by North American women, the Women of the Wall have been trying to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem with Torah reading as the women's tefillah (prayer) groups do in America."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=202}}: "The story of the Women of the Wall began on December 2, 1988, when a group of approximately 100 women participants in the First International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem held a prayer service at the Western Wall. American-born women for the most part, they were accustomed to the more egalitarian religious practises that characterize American Judaism."&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant number of participants are American immigrants or part of the English-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}: "The Israeli women, most of whom were American-born, pledged to return to the Wall on the first day of each month in order to carry out a prayer service."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-David|2003|p=26}}: "It is not surprising that a disproportionate number of the Women of the Wall are, like Ner-David, American immigrants, or part of the larger native English-speaking Israeli community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}: "While noted in Israel, these incidents receive far more attention in the United States. The main reason for the publicity is that the worshipers drawing ire are disproportionately American."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|1991|p=298}}: "Women of the Wall, organized to literally and metaphorically break down the barriers to women's prayer at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Most of the initiators and participants in these activities have been immigrants from English-speaking countries."&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the differing social conditions of Orthodox women in the United States and Israel respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Satlow|2006|p=67}}: "By and larger, Israeli Orthodox women focus their religious life domestically. The growing difference between the roles of women in Western and Israeli Orthodoxy is in part due to social conditions. Whereas in the United States, for example, the push toward increasing female participation in religious services is primarily driven by highly educated, professional women who experience a gap between their high-status place in the secular world and their confinement behind the mechitza in the synagogue, the achievement of higher education and high-status jobs by Orthodox women in Israel is far rarer."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Rosner]] describes the phenomena as an "American-imported battle" for religious pluralism, religious moderation and tolerance. He notes that civil rights and feminism are American imports, late in coming to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;(Renee Ghert-Zand). [http://www.timesofisrael.com/where-rock-star-anat-hoffman-turns-raging-feminist/ Where ‘rock star’ Anat Hoffman turns raging feminist], ''Times of Israel'',(April 20, 2013). ""The whole battle for the Western Wall is an Americanized and American-imported battle for religious moderation and tolerance," explains Shmuel Rosner, senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and L.A. Jewish Journal columnist. "Women wearing a tallit is not something Israelis are used to. They don't necessarily have negative feelings about it, but it's just strange and feels like it doesn't belong here."" and "Many Israelis dismiss Women of the Wall as foreign interlopers, "but there is something to be said about Women of the Wall appearing non-native," Sztokman offers. "Civil rights and feminism are American imports — and late in coming. But now these things are being adapted to the local context."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Twenty-five years after the founding of WoW, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute in May 2013 found that about half of the Israel public supports the Women of the Wall, and that men (51.5%) are more inclined to support the women's prayer group than women (46%) The poll was conducted by Professor Tamar Hermann, who noted that Women of the Wall received highest levels of support from educated, secular, Ashkenazi Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-half-of-israelis-support-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.523651|title=Poll: Half of Israelis support Women of the Wall|date=13 May 2013|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group was not always met with support from the majority of Israelis, as it is today.

Women of the Wall was founded in December 1988 at the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1988, during the conference, Rivka Haut organized a group of multi-denominational women to pray at the Western Wall. 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the [[Western Wall]], and Rabbi [[Deborah Brin]] led a prayer service for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahalatshalom.org/who-we-are/our-rabbi/78-about/163-women-of-the-wall-founding-rabbi-deborah-brin.html|title=Women of the Wall founding Rabbi Deborah Brin - Nahalat Shalom|author=Judy B|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Klagsbrun]] was the one chosen to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women led by Bonna Devora Haberman continued to meet at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/WOW.html |first=Sarah |last=Szymkowicz |title=Women Of The Wall |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall has fought a legal battle asserting a right to conduct organized prayer at the Kotel and challenging government and private intervention in its efforts. After demanding police protection, the government was given nine months to make arrangements that would allow them to pray unhindered. At the end of this period, the Ministry of Religion ruled that only prayer according to the "custom of the place" was to be permitted and that "the sensitivities of other worshippers" must not be offended.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women of the Wall then petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize their right to pray at the Wall. A temporary ruling was given which stated that the ''status quo'' should be enforced until they reached a final verdict.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"/&gt;

The legal battles between the High Court of Justice and the Women of the Wall continued between 1995 and 2000. The Israeli government did not uphold the position that they would find a way for the Women of the Wall to pray, which resulted in an appeal from the Women of the Wall to the High Court of Justice in 1995. This concluded in April 1996, determining the solution was to move the Women of the Wall's prayer from the Western Wall to the Robinson's Arch. Robinson's Arch was not in the area of main prayer. The Women of the Wall appealed this decision to the Ne'eman Committee in 1998, who reaffirmed the previous decision of the High Court Justice. The Women of the Wall accepted the decision on the condition that the area they were being moved to be set up to be a proper prayer area. The government did not do such preparations of the prayer area in Robinson's Arch, resulting in the appeal to the Supreme Court in 2000 by the Women of the Wall. In this appeal, the supreme court ruled that the Israeli government was required to allow the Women of the Wall to exercise their religious freedom and practices at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=2016-04-02|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=79–107|doi=10.1353/sho.2016.0001|issn=1534-5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle has led to two Israeli Supreme Court decisions and a series of debates in the [[Knesset]]. In its first decision, on May 22, 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that it is legal for Women of the Wall to hold prayer groups and read Torah in the women's section of the main Kotel plaza undisturbed. Four days later, [[Haredi]] political parties including [[Shas]] introduced several bills to overturn the decision, including a bill that would have made it a criminal offense for women to pray in non-traditional ways at the Western Wall, punishable by up to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; In response MK Naomi Chazan said "What have we become? Afghanistan? Iran?"&lt;ref name=LAT2000/&gt; Although the bill did not pass, the Israeli Supreme Court reconsidered its earlier decision. On April 6, 2003, the Court reversed itself and upheld, 5-4, the Israeli government's ban prohibiting the organization from reading Torah or wearing tallit or tefillin at the main public area at the Wall, on the grounds that such continued meetings represented a threat to public safety and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030423.html|title="The Israeli Supreme Court Denies Women The Right to Pray at the Western Wall", Findlaw.

Until recently, it was illegal for them to do so under Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/middleeast/22jerusalem.html?_r=0 Challenging Traditions at the Heart of Judaism], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2009. "After a lengthy legal battle, the court ultimately ruled against the women in the interest of public order. Consequently, it is illegal for them to read aloud from the Torah or to wear prayer shawls openly by the wall."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, following pressure from non-Orthodox US Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/women-of-the-wall-urge-jerusalem-police-to-refrain-from-arrests-at-upcoming-service.premium-1.514734 Women of the Wall urge Jerusalem police to refrain from arrests at upcoming service], ''Haaretz'', (April 10, 2013) "Under pressure from the non-Orthodox Jewish world, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Sharansky several months ago to draft .."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natan Sharansky]], the chairman of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], was asked by the Prime Minister to find a solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/10/western-wall-resolve-prayer-rights Western Wall plan unveiled to resolve 24-year-old prayer rights dispute], (10 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the detentions at the wall in February 2013, Sharansky said "When I listen to the very partial presentation, I am fully with them — when I listen to the other side, I have to accept that they also have logic.

This attempt was endorsed by the government to solve the controversy of the wall, but in actuality, this arrangement would have led to the emergence of a new conflict. Instead of ending the quarreling by granting women full rights to worship at the existing wall, the women would have had to fight for recognition among the public at their new area. The area for the women would have been located in what is known as the Robinson's Arch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, three women MKs used their [[parliamentary immunity]] to don prayer shawls and join the Women of the Wall in a show of support after 10 women had been arrested the previous month. MK [[Stav Shaffir]] ([[Israeli Labor Party|Labour]]) said "I usually do not wear a ''tallit'', but it is my honor and duty to stand here and protect the rights of all Jews from around the world to pray as they desire and believe." [[Tamar Zandberg]] ([[Meretz]]) said: "I demand to enter. The extremist stream's interpretation of the Holy Places Law is unacceptable to me, and I refuse to leave the prayer shawl outside. I am a secular woman but I identify with these women's struggle for freedom of expression and religion." Subsequently, a number of MKs condemned their actions. MK [[Aliza Lavie]] ([[Yesh Atid]]), who herself supports the right of the women to assemble, said she was "shocked" that fellow MKs decided to blatantly disobey the law and ignore Supreme Court rulings. MK [[Miri Regev]] ([[Likud]]) called the MKs attendance a "provocation" and referred to the groups "anarchistic actions" which had "turned into a national sport among the extreme Left in Israel." MK [[Uri Ariel]] ([[Bayit Yehudi]]) called the women radicals and suggested that their "gross violations" at the site may lead to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Sharon.

In May 2013, after bowing to pressure from non-Orthodox diaspora Jews, the government issued a directive for the legal dispute to be solved. A subsequent Appellate Court ruling gave permission&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10018346/Women-win-the-right-to-pray-like-men-at-Jerusalems-Western-Wall.html Women win the right to pray like men at Jerusalem's Western Wall], Robert Tait, Daily Telegraph, (April 25, 2013) "Women's rights campaigners won a potential landmark legal victory after a judge ruled that they should be allowed to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, in a manner previously deemed only fit for men."&lt;/ref&gt; for the Women of the Wall to hold services at the site after deciding that their prayer and ritual were not against the "local custom" and since the women did not use physical or verbal violence, they could not be held responsible for any resulting disturbances. The Rabbi of the Western Wall, however, continues to view their presence as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=162 Response of the Rabbi of the Western Wall to the Women of the Wall’s Provocative Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

They have the support of large American non-Orthodox denominations, which view the issue of women's rights to pray at the Wall as a high-profile opportunity to promote gender-egalitarian Jewish prayer, which most Israelis have never experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/176312/women-and-orthodox-waver-over-plan-for-egalitarian/?p=all Women and Orthodox Waver Over Plan for Egalitarian Prayer at Western Wall], Nathan Jeffay, ''Forward'', (May 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They also want to remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reform.org.il/eng/About/NewsItem.asp?ContentID=1323 Women of the Wall: The Controversy Continues], Israel Movement for Reform &amp; Progressive Judaism, (March 18, 2013) "In January, 2013, WOW, the IMPJ and IRAC joined other organizations in filing a petition with the High Court of Justice against the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, demanding that non-orthodox Jews and women receive equal representation for managing the Wall, and requested the court "remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi."&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests have been criticized by groups promoting religious pluralism in Israel. The Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), condemned the arrest of Anat Hoffman and called it a "desecration of God's name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Reform-Rabbis-Issue-Statement-Outrage-Israels-Arrest-Woman-Holding-Torah-Western-Wall-1289352.htm|title=Reform Rabbis Issue Statement of Outrage at Israel's Arrest of Woman for Holding Torah at Western Wall|work=Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Women of the Wall launched a campaign to encourage girls to have their bat mitzvah services at the Kotel. Unlike most diaspora Jewish girls, Israeli Jewish girls typically do not celebrate a bat mitvah by reading from their Torah portion. The ad campaign features girls wearing prayer shawls and holding a Torah scroll in front of the wall. The ad, placed on Israeli buses, has the caption, "Mom, I also want a bat mitzvah at the Kotel!" The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is controlled by the Orthodox and oversees events at the wall, not only runs a business of bar mitzvahs for boys that has excluded girls from their offerings, but has refused to permit women to carry Torah scrolls at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.620543|title=Women of the Wall bus ad campaign encourages bat mitzvahs at the Kotel|date=13 October 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campaign ads were soon vandalized in Orthodox neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/207262/women-of-wall-push-for-bat-mitzvahs-at-western-wal/|title=Women of Wall Push for Bat Mitzvahs at Western Wall|date=13 October 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad campaign received international publicity when religious extremists carried out violent attacks in Jerusalem.

Although the women have won the legal right to pray in their fashion at the wall, Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the Supervisor of the Western Wall, has refused to allow the women to use the Torah scrolls distributed in the men's section or to bring their own. The group said that a reading from the Torah scroll in the women's section was an historic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Women-of-the-Wall-smuggle-tiny-Torah-scroll-to-Western-Wall-for-Bat-Mitzva-379719|title=Women of the Wall smuggle tiny Torah scroll to Western Wall for Bat Mitzva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2014 Women of the Wall held a women's candle lighting at the Kotel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt; Wow sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section just as there is one in the men's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act." Initially, the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.'

In April 2015 Women of the Wall participated in reading from a full-size Torah scroll at the organization's service at the Western Wall. One hundred Torah scrolls are kept for the use of the men's side of the Western Wall and male supporters of Women of the Wall passed a Torah scroll across the barrier into the women's section for Women of the Wall's service.

Police intervened and stopped them. Following the Torah reading service, WoW members in the women's section danced with the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.652640 Women defy Western Wall ban and read from full-size Torah] Haaretz, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;"This is the first time that Women of the Wall can stand up and be counted as a part of the public," proclaimed Anat Hoffman, the chair of WoW. "Nothing you could say could tear me away from my Torah." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, the head of the rabbinic authority of the Western Wall, called the women's Torah reading a provocation and said "the Israel Police and employees of the Western Wall had to work hard in order to avoid bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-women-of-the-wall-pray-with-full-sized-torah-scroll/ In First, Women of the Wall pray with Full-Size Torah scroll] The Times of Israel, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; A group calling itself Original Women of the Wall, which includes founding members of WoW and which contends that WOW has broken away from the original and on-going charter of the group.

|In response to the ruling allowing the Women of the Wall to hold their services at the site, between 5,000-10,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] girls converged to prevent the women from approaching. Police in turn offered protection to around 400 women who formed the largest gathering in the group's history. The women prayed together with a group of male supporters, the first time a mixed service had been held by the organisation. They had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the women's prayer section, but reneged upon the request of Minister of Religious Affairs [[Naftali Bennett]]. Three Haredi men were arrested for disturbing the peace. Chair of Women of the Wall, [[Anat Hoffman]], said "We are continuing in the footsteps of the paratroopers who liberated the Western Wall."&lt;br /&gt;

|Threatening graffiti was sprayed on the front door of an executive board member of the Women of the Wall organisation. It read: "Peggy, you're the first. We know where you live. Jerusalem is holy. The Western Wall will not be forfeited. The Women of the Wall are villains." MK [[Michal Rozin]] ([[Meretz]]) blamed the attack on provocative statements by ultra-Orthodox MKs, and Jerusalem mayor [[Nir Barkat]] and his ultra-Orthodox deputy, Yitzhak Pindrus, denounced the act.

We will no longer practice restraint. We will re-liberate the Western Wall." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch had also received a similar letter.

| [[United Torah Judaism]] arranged for between 5,000-7,000 Haredi girls to assemble at the wall and for the first time in 25 years, police prevented the Women of the Wall from approaching the site. Male protesters numbered around 1,000. The women, numbering around 300, held their service at the entrance to the Western Wall plaza and were occasionally disturbed by shouting and targeted at least twice by water bombs and eggs.

In their struggle for civil rights and religious freedom, members of the group have been willing to engage in civil disobedience and become "prisoners of conscience.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|pp=56–57}}: "But we might also have to go outside both the legal and political system. Would women be willing to do civil disobedience, get arrested? A[nat]: Absolutely! We are hoping that Shas actually passes the bill that would put us in jail for seven years. P[hyllis]: You would sit in jail for seven years? A: We have quite a few women who are willing to become prisoners of conscience. P: Prisoners of conscience . . .

Several members of the group have been arrested for acts that Women of the Wall members say are legal under the Supreme Court ruling. Nofrat Frenkel was arrested for wearing a tallit under her coat and holding a Torah in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3807090,00.html|title=Police Arrest Woman Praying at the Western Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not charged, but she was barred from visiting the Wall for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/119509/,|title=The 'Crime' of Praying with a Tallit, and a Plea for Tolerance: First Person|date=24 November 2009|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's leader, [[Anat Hoffman]], was interrogated by the police in January 2010, fingerprinted, and told that she could be charged with a felony over her involvement with Women of the Wall.

==Women of the Wall's position==
The Women of the Wall have consistently claimed that there is no single "custom of the place" and that their right to pray is a religious freedom enshrined in Israeli law. They believe the Western Wall is a religious site as well as a national site and therefore belongs to the entire Jewish population. Their efforts to challenge the current customs at the Wall and break the ritual status quo continues as they believe that the Wall is a holy place for all Jews. They repeatedly stress that the group is not Reform Jews, but come from all affiliations and that their conduct strictly adheres to Orthodox Jewish Law and that their prayer is genuine and not a political stunt. Their central mission is to "achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall."  The women have made progress and as of 1988, the women have held occasional, uninterrupted prayer services wearing tallitot and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Orthodox establishment's position==
The Israeli Orthodox Jewish religious establishment is opposed to the services conducted by the Women of the Wall. Orthodox rabbis claim that even if such a manner of prayer is theoretically permitted by Jewish Law, it is against Jewish custom. Even if support can be found in Jewish legal sources for various activities, the force of custom is equal to absolute law and it is the custom which determines proper conduct. Various legal opinions recorded in Halacha cannot be manipulated to introduce new forms of prayer.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|pp=638–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], which is cited by Women of the Wall in support of their cause, is rejected by the establishment, as they view the Women of the Wall as being motivated by feminism rather than a sincere spiritual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Frimer, Arye and Dov, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm Women's Prayer Services Theory and Practice] ''Tradition'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Their struggle is also seen as an attempt to undermine their influence and as a strategy for non-Orthodox groups to gradually gain official recognition at state level, paving the way for the introduction of religious pluralism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012|p=}}: "The Israeli Orthodox establishment view the Women of the Wall as being a Trojan horse to introduce Jewish pluralism and establish the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist strains of Judaism in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the group, [[Yehuda Getz]], the government appointed rabbi of the Western Wall, urged them to stop "straying from the hallowed traditions of generations of Jews before you"&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"/&gt; and in 1989, the Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Avraham Shapiro]] and the Religious Affairs Minister suggested that the women "pray individually, silently, and preferably at home-not at the wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
From the outset, the Women of the Wall have been subjected to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose the Women of the Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment of Women of the Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

In 1996, UTJ MK [[Israel Eichler]] wrote: "No one prevents anyone else from praying at the wall in his own fashion, but the wall is the last place to carry out a battle for the right of a woman to wear a ''tallit'', read from the Torah, wear a ''kippa'' and grow a beard."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2000|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Yaakov Litzman]] stated that "there is no desecration greater than that of women who come to desecrate the holiness of the Western Wall with all kinds of provocations such as carrying a Torah scroll and other things reserved by Jewish law only to men"&lt;ref name= LAT2000&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/05/news/mn-37770 Israeli Women Defy Custom, Say a Prayer for Equality], June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ovadia Yosef said: "There are stupid women who come to the Western Wall, put on a tallit (prayer shawl), and pray... These are deviants who serve equality, not Heaven. They must be condemned and warned of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801872,00.html|title=Rabbi Yosef condemns Women of the Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]] suggested that it is "not religious need," but rather "religious politics" which motivates the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|Reinman|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Orthodox women have also disapproved of the group. [[Nehama Leibowitz]] likened their worship to a form of "sport,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterman|2009|p=296}}: "Nehama rejected the argument that women's spiritual needs must be met more fully than convention currently allows. Shira Leibowitz Schmidt recalls that Nehama "unsympathetically labeled as "sport" the untraditional, demonstrative prayer by Women of the Wall..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the widow of  Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] said the group had "gone completely mad" and their actions amount to "desecration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168688 Rabbanit Tzviya Eliyahu: Women of the Wall are 'Crazy'], ''Arutz Sheva'', (June 06, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-Orthodox former Jerusalem city councilwoman Mina Fenton said the women are "a fringe group that attracts people who read the prayer book upside down."&lt;ref name=USA10-05/&gt; The Religious Zionist leadership also voiced its concern in May 2013 when a group of influential rabbis issued a letter calling on public figures "not to let a small group offend the thousands of worshippers arriving to pray at this sacred place on a regular basis." They went on to state that "there are those who have been trying in recent years to change the present situation, offending many and tainting the special atmosphere of holiness of this sacred place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378184,00.html Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall], Kobi Nachshoni, ''ynet.com'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval included a wide range of name-calling, with Women of the Wall being called "witches," "prostitutes," "weird," "childish," and "provocateurs," for wanting to pray in their fashion. The Israeli state and Ministry of Religion referred to Women of the Wall as "witches," who were doing "Satan's work"; "more like prostitutes than women"; "misled, tainted, by modern secular feminism."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet indifference and condemnation for the women's plight came from all sectors of Israeli society, not just from the religious right. Even liberals saw their actions as a "provocation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2009|p=231}}: "However, even academics, intellectuals, and journalists generally committed to a liberal point of view were overtly hostile to the WOW. In newspaper articles and public discussion, they claimed that their actions were a "provocation."&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organisations in Israel viewed their behaviour as "weird and objectionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naveh|2003|p=130}}: "The WoW group has also failed to rally support from Israeli women's organizations: their struggle was and is still considered weird and objectionable."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Halkin]] called them "childish provocateurs"&lt;ref&gt;Halkin, Hillel.

They fail to see in the women's fight a struggle to open up orthodoxy and make it more egalitarian; if they do, they do not consider it to be of any significance because they do not have an interest in religion anyway."&lt;/ref&gt; and that those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] of the political spectrum ignore the women in an attempt to gain Orthodox support for their dovish positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "Politically, the secular majority is interested in the orthodox sector only in as much as it can support their views concerning the peace process. The Left is impatient with the Women of the Wall because they pose yet another obstacle on the road to some Orthodox support of the dovish resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Right supports the orthodox (against the women) because it wishes to strengthen its bond with the religious sector, thereby guaranteeing more support for it hawkish opposition to the formula of land for peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the women initially came mainly from Reform and Liberal communities in North America. In 1990, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] encouraged its members to support Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1990|p=160}}: "Therefore be, it resolved that the CCAR encourage its members and their constituencies to support the Women of the Wall by writing to the Ministers of Religion and Justice, the Prime Minister, the Chief rabbis, public figures, and President of Israel about... b) Women having the option of joining prayer groups at the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] declared it "warmly commends the Women of the Wall for its courageous and principled struggle to be allowed to pray at the Western Wall" and urged Reform congregations to "express solidarity with the Women of the Wall in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org//about/union/governance/reso//?syspage=article&amp;item_id=1945 In Support of Women of the Wall], URJ, (June 4, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a number of non-Orthodox gatherings and services have been held publicly in America in solidarity with the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/132071/nyc-prayer-service-supports-women-of-the-wall NYC Prayer Service Supports Women of the Wall], ''Tablet, (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Reform movement, WOW has faced both support and criticism. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], who is considered the leader of the Reform movement in Israel, argued that WOW's request of 11 hours a year{{clarify|date=December 2017}} did not indicate an urgency that required a change in policy, but he came to support WOW's goals because they align with the Reform movement's opposition to the exclusion of women from religious society in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2013, however, about half of Israeli Jews approved of Women of the Wall and their mission, with the greatest support coming from educated Ashkenazi Jews. Pollsters for the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) and Tel Aviv University surveyed Jews in Israel and found that a clear majority, 64%, of those who defined themselves as secular, and 53% of those who described themselves as traditional but not religious supported the right of Women of the Wall to worship in their fashion. A minority of those who described themselves as traditional religious or Ultra-Orthodox approved. The results showed that overall,  51.8% of men and 46% of women supported Women of the Wall and their right to pray in their fashion at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-back-women-of-the-wall/ Almost half of Israeli Jews back Women of the Wall] Times of Israel, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinions==
Some Jewish feminist activists in Israel have seen the Women of the Wall's activities as being inconsistent with their political activities. Leah Shakdiel of the anti-war group [[Women in Black]] describes the Wall as "all maleness and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakdiel maintains that Israeli society's general opposition to the Women of the Wall is a result of a religious and secular alliance against what they perceive as a feminist challenge. Ran Hirschl believes the conflict is "a contest for cultural hegemony between a secularist-libertarian elite and traditionally peripheral group," namely the ultra-Orthodox community. [[Frances Raday]] posits that the violent opposition by Orthodox Jews stems from the "desire of the Orthodox establishment to preserve religious patriarchal hegemony against the challenge of religious feminism," rather than an attempt to preserve Jewish Law itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Chesler]] of Women of the Wall wrote: "We asked for our rights under civil and religious law. When we prayed, other worshipers, both men and women, verbally and physically assaulted us. We asked the Israeli state to protect us so that we could exercise our rights. The state claimed it could not contain the violence against us, and that we ourselves had provoked the violence by "disturbing/offending" the "sensibilities of Jews at worship." Women are not seen as "Jews" or as "worshipers" with "sensibilities."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"/&gt;
