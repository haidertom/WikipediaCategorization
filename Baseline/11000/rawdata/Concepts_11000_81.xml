The '''Beacham Theatre''' is a [[Cinema (building)|cinema]] built in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr. in the city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]].  The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street.  The building's current lack of impressive [[architecture]] is offset by its significant [[cultural history]].&lt;ref name=Dezern1988&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-02-28/news/0020190106_1_tampa-theatre-beacham-theater-in-atlanta |title=Conflict Now Playing At Beacham Owner: Destroy It -- Activists: Save It |last1= Dezern |first1=Craig |date=February 28, 1988 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 11, 2016 |quote=But when preservationists look, they see a landmark.

An orchestra pit and the gentle slope of the auditorium floor wait, covered by modern alterations.  The debate between progress and preservation has played in old theaters throughout the South, and sometimes preservation has won. But for every theater saved, two more meet the wrecking ball. The Beacham soon may join the fallen theaters. Juarez, a developer and political consultant, has applied for permission to tear down the building at 46 N. Orange Ave., and the Beacham lacks key elements that saved movie palaces in Tampa, Atlanta and Lakeland.

The Beacham was once part of the [[vaudeville]] circuit and hosted celebrity acts such as [[John Phillip Sousa]], the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and [[W.C. Fields]], whose signature was once visible inside a dressing room.  In the eras of [[silent film]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema#Classical Hollywood cinema In the Sound Era (late 1920s – 1960)|Classical Hollywood cinema]], the Beacham was operated as a [[movie theater]] that utilized then-current [[state-of-the-art]] [[Film|motion picture]] technology.

'''The Beacham''', as it is currently named, has since been used as a series of [[concert venue]]s and [[nightclub]]s thus saving it from [[demolition]].  The Beacham Theatre was once home to the late-night [[Underground culture|underground]] [[discotheque]] '''Aahz''' that is recognized internationally as a birthplace and critical component of the [[electronic dance music]] [[Clubbing (subculture)|movement]].

==History==

===Construction===

[[file:Orange_County_Florida_Jail_(gaol)_photo.jpg|thumb|165px|left|The former Orange County Jail on the site of the Beacham Theatre]]

The Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=With "News" Correspondents (Florida) |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew23moti_7#page/3198/mode/2up |magazine=Motion Picture News|location=New York|publisher=Motion Picture News, Inc. |date=May–June 1921 |access-date=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had served as [[Mayor of Orlando]] during 1907.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;  In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500–$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the [[cemetery]] instead of purchasing the old jail.&lt;ref name=ActTwo /&gt;  The property he purchased had formerly served as the [[gaol|jail]] for [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] since about 1873.&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie Gaub Antequino|author2=Tana Mosier Porter|author3=Historical Society of Central Florida|title=Lost Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC|year=2012|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-9173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street).  The new building was then known as "Beacham's Block" and is now known the Beacham Building.  The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several [[Capital punishment|condemned]] prisoners were executed by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Schaal Hinson|first=Sandra|date=February 1983|title=A mover behind shakers|url=|magazine=Orlando Magazine|location=Orlando|publisher=Orlando Magazine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Beacham Has Come Long Way: Lillian Gish to Queen Esther|last=Ives|first=Sidney|date=December 23, 1953|work=The Orlando Evening Star|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981&gt;{{cite news |url= |title= Curtain rises on new act for Beacham|last1=Sweers |first1=Katheryn |date=July 12, 1981 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|last1=Andrews|first1=Mark|date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Means1982&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Requiem for the Beacham Theatre|last=Means|first=Howard|date=October 17, 1982|work=The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rajtar2006 /&gt;  According to local [[folklore]], the Beacham Building is reportedly [[ghost|haunted]].&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-16/entertainment/0102150519_1_gavin-tour-downtown-orlando |title=A Jaunt Into Haunts |last1=  Wallace Dickinson  |first1= Joy |date=February 16, 2001 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date= August 14, 2016|quote=Gavin's tour includes tales of a sensational murder across the street from the Angebilt in the vanished San Juan Hotel and of a secret tunnel connecting the Angebilt to the old Beacham Theater (now the Tabu night spot at 46 N.

The Beacham's [[auditorium]] features "square [[columns]] adorned with feathered [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] that climb gracefully to a high ceiling decorated with rectangles of intricate [[plasterwork]]."&lt;ref name=Dezern1988 /&gt;  When constructed, the theater was outfitted with [[Curtain|draperies]] that covered the plaster walls.  The draperies had "mild tan figures delicately woven into the broad white field with an occasional soft blue figure" that were selected by Mrs. Roberta Holland Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Sr.&lt;ref name="newbeacham1921" /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theater in 1921.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The Beacham Theatre shortly after construction in 1921]]

Beacham outfitted his theater with innovative state-of-the art equipment from the Southern Theater Equipment Company of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Glover1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-12-04/news/0090000006_1_bookhardt-beacham-sidewalks|title=1907: Beacham Elected Mayor|last1=Glover|first1=C.A.|date=December 4, 1988|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 16, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Beacham's box office in the lobby featured both an automatic [[admission ticket]] [[vending machine]] dispenser and ticket [[cutting|chopping]] machine.

The Beacham Building's construction featured numerous [[fireproofing]] and [[fire safety]] measures.  When the theater opened, the auditorium had an operating capacity of 1400.&lt;ref name=newbeacham1921&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=New Beacham is one of Refinement and Elegance: Equipment of New Beacham Theater is the Finest that is Obtainable.  |url= |newspaper= The Evening Reporter-Star.|location=Orlando. |date=December 8, 1921 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tunnels]] from the theater stage trap ran into the basements of two nearby hotels.  The tunnels had low ceilings and were sealed during new construction in the early 1980s.  The tunnels extended south into the [[San Juan Hotel]], where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office,&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt; and then east under Orange Avenue into the [[Angebilt Hotel]].  Historians reason that the purpose of the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area.&lt;ref name="Rajtar2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Rajtar|title=A Guide to Historic Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cZfqYU1B4cC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2006|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-198-0|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-02-10/news/HISTORYTRAILS_1_historic-trails-boy-scout-florida|title=Take a walk into Florida's past  |last1=Shrieves |first1=Linda |date=February 10, 2007|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel''|access-date= August 5, 2016|quote=Behind the theater's backstage is a trap door to a tunnel that runs underneath Orange Avenue to the 11-story brick building that was once the grand Angebilt Hotel.

===Vaudeville and Silent film era===

On December 9, 1921, Orlando's premier vaudeville and movie house opened by showing [[Norma Talmadge filmography|''The Wonderful Thing'']], starring [[Norma Talmadge]], a [[Pathé News]] [[newsreel]], and [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[The Boat (film)|The Boat]]''.&lt;ref name="ActTwo"&gt;Act Two: A Beacham History.  1985.

The senior Braxton Beacham died in 1924 after a long illness, and Roberta Holland Beacham died soon after in 1926.  Their [[Estate (law)|estate]] and [[real property]] were left to their [[child]]ren, Norma K. Hughes, Roberta Augusta Rogers, Braxton Beacham Jr., and his wife Roberta Branch Beacham.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

[[Florida]] and [[Orlando]] were on what was referred to by [[List of vaudeville performers: A–K|vaudeville performers]] as "[[Straw hat|The Straw Hat]] [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Circuit]]."  The Beacham Theatre was included on the [[Alexander Pantages]], [[Orpheum Circuit#Late circuit (1919–1928)|Orpheum]], and [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith-Albee]] vaudeville performance circuits (later combined as the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] circuit).&lt;ref name=Wilkening /&gt;&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;

Manager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included [[Raffle|Bank Night]], [[Talent show|Amateur Night]], and  [[General store|Country Store Night]], which was supported by dozens of local [[merchant]]s.  An [[magazine|advertisement]] for the Beacham in 1925 says,  "Don't talk about the hot weather.  Beat the heat in a Beacham seat.  'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort."&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;What's What, Here and There as Recorded by "Bobby" (1925) magazine. Theatrical section via LMS, Orange County Public Library. Orlando.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Bell served as manager of the theater with [[organist]] Herman Siewart and Ken Guernsey leading the community [[sing-along]] at [[Forum (legal)|open forum]] meetings that were held for several months during the winter on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The Beacham's "[[Film promotion|exploitation]] director" Frank H. Burns often designed and created large elaborate [[standee|standing displays]] that decorated the facade and lobby of the theater in order to [[Out-of-home advertising|advertise]] new film features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew00moti_7/motionpicturenew00moti_7_djvu.txt|title=Motion Picture News (May-Jun 1925)"|last=|first=|date=May 2, 1925|website=mediahistoryproject.org|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art Library coordinated by the Media History Digital Library|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/motionpicturenew00moti_7|archive-date=July 3, 2015|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconic displays that Burns created for the Beacham Theatre were sometimes complete with [[Costume coordination|coordinated costumes]] for the employees.

In 1928 [[Vitaphone]] and [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] [[Sound film|"talkie"]] equipment debuted during the city's first "Progress Week" during the last week of August.   "The queen of the [[Femme fatale|vamps]]," [[actress]] [[Theda Bara]], was in appearance at the Beacham as [[secondary education in the United States|students]] from [[Orange County Public Schools#High schools|Orlando High School]] sneaked into the balcony via the [[fire escape]].&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Sound was provided by two [[gramophone records|gramophone discs]] that accompanied each film.  Both [[phonograph]]s were played simultaneously in case the needle skipped during a film.  Output could be easily switched so that the film's sound could remain in [[synchronicity]] with the picture.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982/&gt;   William Booth succeeded Frank Bell as manager of the Beacham after Bell was transferred in 1928.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The city's "[[Blue law|Sunday closing law]]" was repealed by [[Voting|voters]] in 1929 by a majority of only 59 votes.  Movie theaters and other businesses in Orlando were then permitted to operate seven days a week.

Interest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into [[obsolescence]].  On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was [[raffle]]d with prizes of $50.  On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 [[Austin 7#Austin Seven Swallow|Austin 7 Sport Roadster]] was given away.
Vaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933.  Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville.

In 1933 following a bitter [[lawsuit]] against Orlando Enterprises over nonpayment of the lease for the building that had been originally negotiated with the senior Braxton Beacham in 1924, the theater was closed for almost three weeks.  $8000 in back taxes on Beacham's building was due.  Beacham Jr. claimed the closure was deliberate and malicious and sued for $100,000.  Two separate judgments were entered against Orlando Enterprises Inc. for $2291.67 each and a payment agreement was reached.  Litigation was then withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

As a result of the suit the lease was not renewed and Beacham's theater again became Orlando's only independent cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orlandoretro.com/2013/04/18/beacham-movie-line-up-in-september-1933/ Beacham Movie Line Up in September 1933] (April 18, 2013), retrieved February 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the theater was soon leased Florida State Theaters.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  Harry Vincent was named manager of the reopened theater in 1933; however, soon after, Vernon D.

In August 1937 the [[Orlando Police Department]] raided the Beacham Theatre.

''[[The Orlando Story]]'', filmed by Don Parrisher Motion Picture Productions of New York, contained images of daily life in Orlando.

In December 1949 ''The [[Tom Thumb]] [[Follies]]'' staged [[Radio in the United States#Local radio in the Golden Age|radio broadcast]] performances at the Beacham.  When a  [[Santa Claus]] from the [[Elks Lodge]] lifted one young elf into the audience for the last verse, the smell of [[bourbon whiskey]] caused her to ponder, "I wasn't just sure where the night's polka would land us.

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the Beacham Theatre had frequent [[Sit-in|stand-in protest]]s by [[African Americans|African American]] [[Citizenship|citizens]] of relegation to lesser "[[African-American|colored]] theaters" mandated by [[Jim Crow laws]] such as the [[Florida Constitution of 1885]].

In 1964 the theater was temporarily closed down while [[Cinerama]] equipment was installed.  A super-wide [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic movie screen]] was added to the auditorium and the stereophonic sound system was upgraded.  Two [[Philips DP70|Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projector]]s and a small restroom for the projectionist were installed in a newly built downstairs projection booth under the balcony that required the removal of two aisles and several seats.  Following the Beacham's upgrade to [[70 mm film]] technology, ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' had a continuous 14-month run between 1965 and 1966.&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;

====End of the first-run movie era====
[[File:Old Beacham Theatre logo sticker.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1990's logo depicting the Beacham Theatre's mid-century marquee.]]
During the 1970s Orlando, like many U.S. cites, was experiencing symptoms of [[urban decay]].  The rush from the city to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses.  As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ActTwo /&gt;   Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters.&lt;ref name=Treasures /&gt;  Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing [[exploitation films]] and [[B movie#1970s|B-movie]] [[action films]].&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  The next year, H. A. Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long-time [[lessee]] Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  After showing a Sunday double-feature of ''[[Return of the Street Fighter]]'', and [[The Scavengers (1969 film)|''The Scavengers'']], the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975.&lt;ref name=lastday&gt;Last picture Show: Beacham. September 28, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the monthly lease of $2700 until the theater was sold.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

===Live Entertainment era===

In 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter purchased the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr.  A [[great-granddaughter]] of Braxton Beacham,  Mrs. Bray, refused to sell the theater by itself without also selling the rest of the building as a package.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included stunning multi-colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story [[mural]] of a saxophone and its open case painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby [[Interstate 4]].  Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's [[Franchising|franchise]] location of '''The Great Southern Music Hall''' at the Beacham in 1976.&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;   The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a [[concert venue]] that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham.  The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented [[world cinema]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] films by [[film director]]s such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Federico Fellini]], and [[Mel Brooks]] during the week.  John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts.  As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable.  Nevertheless,  Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for [[Notability|notable]] musical acts and competition from larger venues.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

Roberta Branch Beacham died in 1980.

In 1981 Sherry Carpenter, then sole owner, leased the theater to Jeff Roberts.  Roberts opened '''Laser World''', a [[futuristic]] one- and one-half hour [[laser light show]] that featured [[lasers]], [[sound]], [[ballet]], costumed [[modern dance]] routines and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] [[illusion]], as well as [[outer space]] [[photographs]] that were projected onto a large viewing screen from behind.&lt;ref name="Sweers1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;  Laser World closed in 1982.&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

Other short-lasting entities followed such as a [[Tourism|tourist-oriented]] [[laser tag]] business.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  ''[[Orlando Sentinel|The Orlando Sentinel]]'' critic Howard Means, reminded readers, that the 1965 installation of "then-new [[Cinerama]] equipment at the Beacham was the latest testimony to the faith in the future of Downtown Orlando" and that, "The Beacham had long been seen as a bellwether of the health of the center city."  Upon further reflection, he lamented, "that the Beacham is simply a microcosm of modern downtown realities."  Means editorialized, by 1982 "The present state of the Beacham was the latest testament to decay," and, "In the way of dying enterprises, the Beacham's reincarnations became increasingly more short-lived."&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

In February 1983 Oscar F. Juarez, an Orlando [[Real estate development|property developer]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[strategist]], purchased the building for $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="Benedick1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-04-07/news/0030160194_1_beacham-juarez-board-members |title=Goodbye Voted For Beacham Board Says Owner May Tear Old Theater Down|last1=Benedick  |first1=Robin  |date=April 7, 1988 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the purchase, a plan was announced to lease it in order to open a [[bar]] and French restaurant "with a [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] flair" that later became Valentyne's Restaurant as well as a new nightclub inside the theater.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;

A vision for the theater announced in 1983 was for a New York-style nightclub dubbed '''Studio 46''' that emulated the spirit of the legendary "[[Studio 54]]."&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  Studio 46 did not come to fruition but the primordial description of Orlando's very own "Studio 54" at the Beacham Theater was soon realized just a few years later.&lt;ref name="Abbott2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-06-27/entertainment/os-jim-abbott-aahz-reunion-orlando-20130627_1_legacy-third-wave-dj-kimball-collins |title= Make a return to AAHZ once more|last1=Abbott |first1= Jim |date=June 27, 2013|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 5, 2016 |quote= Gazing upward at the high ceiling inside The Beacham, DJ Kimball Collins reflects on the role that the building itself had on the mystique of AAHZ, the progressive house-music parties that put Orlando on the international map as a hotbed of electronic music in the early 1990s..."We always wanted people to come experience it here," Collins says of the Beacham. "This is like our Studio 54; there's just something about this room."  Between roughly 1989 and 1992, AAHZ blossomed into a weekly all-night Saturday dance party that attracted devoted fans who would travel from across the state to dance until daylight. "There's a scene in the movie '54,' when one of the characters walks into the club for the first time and everything just slows down and it's sensory overload,"... That philosophy yielded AAHZ, a concept eternally beloved by its fans and those who created it..."It still has some sort of energy in here for them," Collins says, looking around the room. "We feel it." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was next leased by Ellen Hunt, of Orlando, and Roger Lopez, of [[France]] in August 1983.  Hunt and Lopez opened a [[cabaret]] club in the theater named '''[[Moulin Rouge|Moulin Orange]]''' that featured [[Las Vegas]]-style [[showgirl]]s.&lt;ref name="Hagstrom1984"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Curtain Call for Old Beacham Theater|last=Hagstrom|first=Suzy|date=November 5, 1984|work=The Orlando Sentinel|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moulin Orange was only open for several months during 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;

In December 1984 with the hope of operating an expansion to his [[dinner theater]] franchise, a five-year lease of the theater was granted to Theatre Management Corporation of Orlando consisting of [[actor]] Tom McKinney and Rick Allen, a producer of the [[Burt Reynolds#Other roles|Reynolds]] Theater.&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;  The Beacham served as a '''Celebrity Dinner Theater''' franchise location in conjunction with Valentyne's [[restaurant]] that was next door from 1985 until 1986.&lt;ref name="Hagstrom1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maupin1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-11-03/lifestyle/0080110137_1_beacham-liberace-belletto |title=Theater Revival At The Beacham Won't Last Long |last1= Maupin|first1=Elizabeth |date=November 3, 1988 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016|quote=The Beacham -- which closed as a movie house in 1975 -- has stood empty off and on for years, between incarnations as the Great Southern Music Hall, Celebrity Dinner Theater and a number of shorter-lived enterprises.

Despite the new recognition for the theater by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential.  Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new [[skyscraper]] that would be used as a combination office building and hotel.&lt;ref name=Snyder1987&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-07-13/business/0180230093_1_juarez-magnolia-avenue-orange-avenue |title=Juarez Building Finally Fills Up Developer Considers Building Second Office Project|last1=Snyder |first1= Jack|date=July 13, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=September 4, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrizio 1987"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-08-23/news/0140190075_1_historic-preservation-landmark-beacham |title=Historic Label No Guarantee Beacham Theater's Owner May Raze Old Downtown Building For New One |last1=Patrizio |first1= Ron |date=August 23, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016|quote=The Beacham Theater has served as a city hall, vaudeville playhouse and movie theater.

Additional parking could have contributed to a revitalized downtown area, but the market for office space in Downtown Orlando was nearly saturated in the late 1980s and there was a general lack of interest from prospective future [[tenants]].

In 1987 Brad Belletto and then-wife Lisa moved to Orlando from [[Louisiana]]. Brad Belletto, then owned a theatrical equipment manufacturing company and had formerly owned  Moon Sound, a [[New Orleans]] sound and lighting company. The Bellettos, intent on overhauling the music scene in Orlando, were looking for a new venue following operation of a successful club in [[Baton Rouge]].  They found the Beacham Theatre and immediately fell in love with it. At that time, the Beacham was being subleased to Clark J, a local record producer, and a brief partnership was formed.

Late in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathers1991&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathers |first=Sandra |date=December 22, 1991 |title=Theater Plans Holiday Treat For Homeless|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-22/news/9112200744_1_dinner-hammersmith-belletto|newspaper=''the Orlando Sentinel'' |location=Orlando |access-date= October 13, 2016|quote=The sit-down dinner is the brainchild of Brad and Lisa Belletto, whose Entertainment Investments company operates the theater and jazz club...Belletto said he patterned the dinner after a similar theater event he was involved with in New Orleans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease.  The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses.&lt;ref name=Mathers1991 /&gt;

The Bellettos planned to use the Beacham Theatre for [[Theatre|theatrical]] performances and concerts during the week and as a [[nightclub]] on the weekends.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;  Frank Carroll, served as the managing artistic director for theatre productions and starred in a [[Las Vegas]]-style musical [[revue]] tribute to [[Liberace]], ''Viva Liberace, Viva''.

In May 1989 the Beacham Theatre was sold by Oscar Juarez for $1.8 million to a [[property management]] firm owned by [[Longwood, Florida|Longwood]] businesswoman Missy Casscells and her husband Frank Hamby.&lt;ref name="Jackson1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-10-31/business/9210310587_1_blues-club-beacham-alcoholic-beverage |title=State Files To Revoke Club's Liquor License|last1= Jackson|first1=Jerry |date=October 31, 1992 |website= orlandosentinel.com|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 20, 2016 |quote=A Longwood businesswoman who owns the historic Beacham Theatre building in which the nightclub was located said she hopes to see some kind of similar club operation continue. "We want something in there that Orlando can be proud of," said Missy Casscells, a property manager who owns the Beacham building on Orange Avenue.  Casscells, 32, said she has owned the Beacham building since May 1989. She said it was acquired from Oscar Juarez, a well-known Orlando businessman and Republican party activist, for about $1.8 million. Casscells said she and her husband, Frank Hamby, manage their family-owned property}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late Night era: (1988–1994) Aahz  ====

Brad and Lisa Belletto scoured sources across the U.S. and Europe and traveled frequently for new and rare records. During the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that began in 1988, on Friday and Saturday nights the Beacham Theater housed a [[discothèque|discotheque]] that had a progressive dance music format with Lisa Belletto as resident DJ and lighting control operator and Brad Belletto as operating director. Initially the club was to be called "[[Special effect|'''F/X''' (or '''Effects''')]]"&lt;ref name=Belletto1989&gt;Beacham Theatre Returns! 1988. Brad Belletto.&lt;/ref&gt;  but it opened as [[Hi-NRG|'''Pure Energy''']].

The late nights at the Beacham featured [[disc jockeys|DJs]], [[Beatmatching|beat matching]], [[Rare groove|rare and obscure]] [[dance music]] on [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]], [[intelligent lighting]], and themed decor that at times included original [[painting]]s by local artist Rollo. The popularity of dancing throughout the night at the Beacham Theatre initially caught on slowly and many free passes were given out.   Soon, the entry queue for "Late Night" snaked around the block.

The conceptual themes for "Late Night" were frequently alternated (sometimes weekly) and occasionally repeated.  The various themes subsequently included '''[[World War III]]''', [[Land of Oz|'''Aahz''']], [[Last Train to Trancentral#Trancentral|'''Trancentral''']], '''[[Haunted house|The Haunted Theatre]]''', [[Egypt#Prehistory and Ancient Egypt|'''Egypt''']],  '''[[Alphabet City]]''', '''Psychedelic Babylon''',  '''[[Unity (mathematics)|Unity]]''', and '''[[family reunion|Reunion]]'''. The all-night [[Dance party|dance parties]] were eventually referred to using the [[umbrella term]] "'Late Night' at the Classic Beacham Theatre."

The Aahz nightclub concept was born after Lisa saw the name at a shop in [[Los Angeles]].  The Bellettos and Shayni Howen then created and developed the Aahz concept for the Beacham.  Shayni and her team created Aahz's iconic décor which included a painted yellow brick road and a giant [[paper mache]] [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] head behind the stage.  At midnight each night, the stage's curtain was raised and the glowing eyes and smoking mouth of the Wizard were revealed, at which point DJ Lisa always played Rhythm Device's ''Acid Rock''.

Eventually the combined tasks of simultaneously playing all of the music and operating the lights became overwhelming for Lisa and as a result Shayni's sister, "Late night" veteran Stacey "StaceBass" Howen, was brought in to operate the computerized [[lighting control console]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] the nightclub.  By the Summer of 1989, Lisa was expecting her first child and still resident DJ.  Only two months before the birth of her son she invited Kimball Collins, who was the DJ in the Beacham Buildings northern unit, to replace her and hired him as Aahz's resident Late Night DJ.  Joseph Jilbert (DJ Jo-Edd), Steve McClure (DJ Monk) and Paul Campbell (DJ Stylus) had brief stints as DJ at "Late Night" when they were hired to fill in for Lisa or Kimball Collins. Dave Cannalte was quickly brought in as "Late Night's" co-resident DJ.

At this point, [[Underground music]] such as [[Industrial dance music]] and [[Gothic rock]] was played during Orlando's normal [[bar]] operating hours from 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. until just after 2&amp;nbsp;a.m.
Upon an announcement at around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. (or an opening at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=Montes /&gt;) that said simply, "Welcome to Late Night," mixed [[New Beat]], [[Progressive house|Progressive dance]], [[Balearic beat]], and [[Acid house]] electronic dance music began that frequently lasted until 8 a.m. and occasionally lasted until as late as 11 a.m.&lt;ref name=ThumpDJThree /&gt;

Local DJ's Jerry Johnson (''the Reverend''),  Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, Eddie Pappa ([[DJ Icey]]) and DJ Lisa Belletto were occasional guests for special events such as the "DJ Unity for the World" dance party in December 1991.&lt;ref name=Unity&gt;{{cite news |last=Abbott |first= Jim|date=December 6, 1991 |title=Public Enemy To Play Orlando |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-06/entertainment/9112050582_1_ron-brooks-downtown-orlando-concert|newspaper=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |location= Orlando|access-date=October 12, 2016|quote=Saturday, the Beacham Theatre will host DJ Unity for the World, a dance party featuring the talents of Central Florida club deejays Jerry ''the Reverend'' Johnson, Lisa Belletto, Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, DJ Ice, the Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Fortier]] later joined the duo of Kimball and Dave Cannalte as an Aahz resident DJ.&lt;ref name="jive2005" /&gt;  As it evolved, "Late Night" boosted the careers of numerous DJs and producers such as Andy Hughes, [[Jimmy Van M]], [[AK1200]], [[DJ Icey]], [[DJ Baby Anne]], Sean Cusick, and [[Cosmic Baby]], as well as [[Dave Seaman]], [[Sasha (Welsh DJ)|Sasha]] and [[John Digweed]].&lt;ref name=Montes &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pandora.com/station/329fee63a4f3e82d33c4865fe69c7bea68f6545495cedc47 |title=John Digweed Radio |last1= Montes De Oca|first1=Mark |date= May 5, 2008|website=pandora.com |publisher=Pandora |access-date=September 2, 2016 |quote=Digweed came to the United States through Orlando, FL and had this to say about that night, "It wasn't until 1993, when I did a big party in Orlando, that it kicked things off for Sasha and I.

That party Digweed was speaking of took place at Aahz Nightclub in Orlando, Florida's Beacham Theater, a nightclub that was actually a functioning theater during its normal operating hours. However, at 3:00am on Saturday nights, Aahz would open its doors to the then hugely popular, and extremely underground, Rave scene of the early 90's.

AAHZ was a late night event that was held at The Beacham nightclub back in the late 80′s/early 90′s. It was so much more than just a night at a club though. It was more of a family reunion every time you walked through the doors. This was in the era where PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect) was still the main player at these sort of events. This was back in the day before distractions like cell phones and digital cameras were in everyone's hands and it was just you, the crowd, and the DJ.  The time when music connected people in a way that very few will ever understand.  People came from all over the state to attend the famed AAHZ events. This was a place where you could go and totally let loose without fear of judgment by others. People came to AAHZ for the music and the vibe. The way the DJ's were able to use their turntables to emotionally connect so many different people through their music could not be duplicated anywhere. They quite literally had the mood of the entire room in their hands behind the decks. People thrived off of this new underground culture that was being introduced to Orlando through these AAHZ events.  AAHZ was in a league of its own in the Orlando club scene, hosting international talents like Sasha and John Digweed, but, little did anyone know what AAHZ would do for its resident DJ's Kimball Collins and Dave Cannalate. Both have become international superstars and a slew of other AAHZ regular customers like Andy Hughes and DJ Icey were not too far behind them. There is no doubt that AAHZ and its DJ's helped put Orlando on the map and in the forefront of the entire Electronic Dance Music movement across the United States.  There really is no way to adequately convey the true meaning or raw emotion of what AAHZ was, or why so many people considered it to be "home." ... Unfortunately, AAHZ came to an end in 1992, and with that came the end of an era for the Orlando club scene and Orlando Electronic Dance Music as a whole. The days of AAHZ may never be able to be totally recreated as it once was, however, AAHZ holds their reunion in Downtown Orlando every year, where they make sure that old school vibe is still in full effect. People who were involved in it during its peak fly in from all around the country just to attend and reclaim their little piece of perfect that used to reside in the heart of Downtown Orlando.}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RPM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waxdj.com/djs/5215//info_16436.php |title=Aahz '89 Quintessential New Beat w/ DJ Joe Ed Info:|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 25, 2008 |website= waxdj.com|publisher=WaxDJ |access-date= September 1, 2016|quote=DJ Joe Ed was one of the founding fathers of Aahz (Orlando) with Stace-Bass and Steve McClure until he handed the reigns off to Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins who made Aahz what we remember to this day! ...

The final all-night Aahz-themed events (The Return of Aahz) were held at the Beacham between September 7, 1991, and July 4, 1992, and lasted until Dekko's opened.  However, "Aahz" was the theme that really stuck with patrons and among participants is still used as a [[nickname]] for "Late Night" reunion tour events and even for the Beacham Theatre itself.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/the-florida-winter-had-ju/Content?oid=2259479 |title=Wizards of Aahz: The Florida winter had ju... |last1= Kelemen |first1=Matt |date=September 2, 1998 |website=orlandoweekly.com |publisher=The Orlando Weekly |access-date=November 30, 2015 |quote=Collins could not be aware of it at the time, but those Saturday nights -- eventually known as "Aahz"-- would kick-start an underground culture and spawn countless DJ careers.

====Cultural impact====

The early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own [[Summer of Love]] between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the [[Clubbing (subculture)|subculture]] surrounding [[electronic dance music]] in Florida and subsequently in the United States.  "Late Night" organized several [[music festival]]s that were held at the [[Orange County Convention Center]] such as the "[[Infinity (philosophy)|Infonet]]" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the "Infonet 2" dance party on December 31, 1992, and "Infonet 3," "The Underground Explosion," on July 3, 1993.  Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events.  Although, "[[rave]]s" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called [[Electronic dance music#Popularization in the United States|rave-oriented]] nightclubs that followed it.&lt;ref name=Guinto1993&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-08-01/news/9308010603_1_rave-downtown-orlando-spinoffs |title= All The Rave|last1=Guinto |first1= Liesl  |date=August 1, 1993 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 16, 2016 |quote=The Orlando rave scene can trace its roots back almost five years to the old Beacham Theatre in downtown Orlando, also known as Aahz.

====End of the Late Night and Live Entertainment eras====

Inside "Late Night" at the Beacham was always very dark and the auditorium was absolutely filthy.  In contrast, initially the scene's "[[Energy (esotericism)|vibe]]" was pure and drugs such as [[MDMA]] that were available  were relatively unadulterated.  As time went on, the beloved Beacham was [[Beautification|beautified]] and remodeled into Dekko's.  While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall "vibe" of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of [[club drugs]] that were still available during that time became tainted.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

During the summer of 1994, at a "Late Night" event featuring a [[guest appearance]] DJ Sasha, two female revelers who were attending a Reunion  event at the Beacham Theatre collapsed just before sunrise.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt; The women were carried outside to Orange Avenue in front of Dekko's where [[CPR]] was administered by an [[Orlando Police Department]] officer and [[paramedics]] were dispatched.  Tragically, one of the young women [[death|expired]].  ''The Orlando Sentinel'' reported the May 1, 1994, passing of 20-year old Teresa Schwartz and that the other young woman was briefly in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-02/news/9405020286_1_lake-mary-downtown-nightclub-orlando |title=2 Women Fall Ill At Club In Orlando - 1 Is Dead |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 8, 2016 |quote=A 20-year-old Melbourne woman died and an 18-year-old Lake Mary woman is in critical condition after both collapsed from what Orlando police think were drug overdoses at a downtown nightclub Sunday morning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-06-18/news/9506150696_1_mdma-ecstasy-downtown-orlando |title=Drugs: Facing Agony Of Ecstasy |last1=  Leithauser|first1=Tom |date=June 18, 1995 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-07-06/news/9407060231_1_drug-overdose-schwartz-apparent-drug |title=Woman Dies Of Apparent Drug Overdose, Police Say |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=July 29, 2016 |quote=In the earlier death, 20-year-old Teresa Schwartz of Melbourne collapsed May 1 outside of Dekko's Night Club on Orange Avenue downtown.

The incident along with those at other venues in Orlando, shocked the underground dance club scene in Central Florida and were followed by a dramatic decrease in attendance.  "Late Night's" organizers made the responsible decision to end Reunion at Dekko's after their pleas for young club-goers to practice [[moderation]] were ignored.  The Dekko's concept was sold to a competitor in the following months.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=clubscene2015 /&gt;

On Saturday nights during 1995 "Late Night" briefly resumed in The Club at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] with DJ Robby Clark Kimball Collins, Dave Cannalte, StaceBass and friends.&lt;ref name=ThumpDJThree /&gt;  However, the City of Orlando subsequently created a "Rave Review Task Force" in 1997 and later passed a [[local ordinance]] that contributed to Florida's crackdown on after-hours nightclubs.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name="clubscene2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=

====Night Club exclusive use era====

By 1992 the future looked brighter for the Beacham Theatre when Mike Berry, staff writer, for ''The Orlando Sentinel'' wrote that, "The Beacham Theatre is the latest testament to [[reincarnation]]."  Concerts were no longer being held in the auditorium during this time period and the Beacham Theatre was used exclusively as night club through 2010.

It was 1992 when Orlando [[Lawyer|Attorney]] Mark NeJame leased the Beacham Theatre with the option to match the purchase price of any prospective buyers.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;   The Beacham underwent restoration at a cost of in excess of $1,000,000.  NeJame then opened "'''Dekko's'''," a mainstream "high-energy dance club."   "Dekko's" is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of [[Art Deco|Deco]] and [[Gekko]].    The "Dekko's" concept featured a rose-beige exterior with a newly [[Building restoration|restored]] [[Art Deco]] inspired facade with red [[neon lighting]].  Dekko's interior included extensive use of the color [[purple]] and a [[sushi]] bar in the balcony.  The inclusion of a [[terrarium]] ([[vivarium]]) with live subtropical [[geckos]] was planned.&lt;ref name=Berry1992&gt;{{cite news |last= Berry |first=Mike |date=October 14, 1992  |title=Another facade may soon grace historic Beacham: Beacham may get a Face Lift |url= |newspaper= The Orlando Sentinel|location=Orlando, FL |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Dekko's" was open from late 1992 until the "high-energy dance club" [[concept]] was bought out in 1994 by Bill Harmening who operated The Edge, a competing nightclub.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

"'''Zuma Beach Club'''" followed Dekko's and opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Early1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recently remodeled auditorium was gutted for the change.  Redecoration was complete with [[fishing net]]s, galvanized [[watering trough]]s for beer, and [[warning signs]] for [[sharks]].  On February 22, 1995, NeJame entered a new [[partnership]] with George Maltezos, John SanFelippo and brother, Joseph SanFelippo.  Zuma Beach was often described by NeJame as "the cheesiest club in America."  ''Rolling Stone'' in 1997 described Zuma Beach as a "cheesy dive."&lt;ref name=Weir1997 /&gt;  Zuma Beach even hosted an [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] "hardcore" [[professional wrestling]] match on January 29, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#012900 |title=ECW hardcore wrestling |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January–March 2000 |website=prowrestlinghistory.com |publisher=Pro Wrestiling History |access-date=November 22, 2016 |quote=January 29, 2000 in Orlando, FL; Zuma Beach Club drawing 800}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercifully, "Zuma Beach" closed its doors in late 2000.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-06-09/entertainment/0006080412_1_beacham-nejame-zuma|title=Beacham Theatre May live Again |last1= Emmons|first1=M.

Finally, after yet another remodeling of the auditorium, "'''Tabu''' opened in 2001."  Initially, Tabu was more of an upscale nightclub.  [[Backstreet Boy]] [[Howie Dorough]], who performed his first musical at the Beacham as one of the [[Munchkins]] in the [[Lollipop Guild]] for a [[theatre production]] of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', was a design and talent acquisition advisor for Tabu.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000 /&gt;  However, Tabu later became more [[mainstream]].  Tabu had a weekly lineup presentation that with the exception of hosting live music, was similar to the theater's current nightclub iteration.&lt;ref name=Tabunow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-01-06/entertainment/os-bars-rail-010711-20110106_1_tabu-hip-hop-sanfelippo-and-george-maltezos |title=Tabu is now The Beacham |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 6, 2011 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote= John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, co-owners of Tabu ... have partnered with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, co-owners of The Social, in opening the newly named venue at 46 N.

====Return of Live Entertainment====

[[File:Beacham logo 1.gif|thumb|115px|right|Beacham logo]]

In 2011 leases for the Beacham Theatre were renewed by John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, along with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, who leased the adjacent unit.  Their [[partnership]] is named 46/54 North Orange Ave, LLC, and both units are leased from building owners  Margaret Casscells and Frank Hamby, of Beacham Theater, LLC.

[[File:The Beacham logo.png|thumb|200px|left]]

Since 2011 "'''The Beacham'''" nightclub has operated in partnership with "The Social," a smaller venue next door at 54 North Orange Avenue.  The venues, are connected via a [[Passage (architecture)|passage]] and [[door]].  The Beacham features [[disc jockey]] entertainment and plays [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Top 40]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], and [[Reggaeton]]."&lt;ref name=Tabunow /&gt;

The Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social.  Prominent national and international musical acts perform with [[fidelity]] to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s.

==Description==

Beacham's Building is divided into seven rental units using wood frame, brick walls, different facades, and paint. The theater is the south-most unit. The two-story Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 in a simple 20th Century Commercial Style.  The structure is constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[brick]] with [[stucco]] out-surface.  Utilization of wood in the construction was minimized.&lt;ref name="newbeacham1921" /&gt;

===Historical===

The facade was decorated with multi-colored tile trim and impregnated with [[seashell]].  The first story originally contained two small storefronts, a [[boxoffice]], and lobby entrance to the theater as well the [[auditorium]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], dressing rooms, staff restrooms, and a [[green room]].  The second story of the theater contained [[Bathroom|restrooms]], windowed offices, a [[projection booth]], and [[balcony]] seating section as well as additional [[dressing room (theater)|dressing rooms]] accessible by a spiral staircase.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Above the stage was the [[fly system]] and [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]].

=== Modifications ===

In 1936 [[Art Deco]] styling with Mediterranean-style tile was added to the facade and extensive neon lighting was installed the on the entrance [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]].&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt; Inside, the theater was modernized to provide lighted stairs, air conditioning into the dressing rooms, an enlarged auditorium, and improved seating.  Capacity was reduced to 1,051.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  To diminish [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es from the projectors and recorded sound equipment, the auditorium was carpeted with a floral pattern and the plaster walls were covered with an Ozite material.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982&gt;{{cite interview|last=Robinson|first=Wendall|subject-link=|interviewer=B.T. Sherwood|title=Interview of Wendall O. Robinson (projectionist)|url=|location=Orlando|date=February 5, 1982|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon Hunter oversaw the modernization.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in 1991.jpg|thumb|170px|Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in March 1991.]]

In 1954 the look of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of [[parapets]], [[cornices]], and windows.  The marquee was replaced with a new [[Vitreous enamel|porcelain]] one.  The lobby was enclosed with glass doors and the [[boxoffice]] was moved to the right side of the lobby exterior and rebuilt.  An entirely new stucco sheeting was installed over the facade, a wide screen was installed, and new decorations and push-back seats were added with additional alterations to the floor plan and seating areas.  Capacity was reduced to 650.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boxoffice1954 /&gt;

In 1964 the [[proscenium]] was modified to accommodate the installation of [[Cinerama]] widescreen.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt; A new projection room was constructed under the balcony to accommodate 70-mm projectors.
      
By 1975 the theater was no longer being used as a feature cinema. For the 1976 opening of the Great Southern Music Hall, the theater's interior and stage were remodeled, the proscenium was rebuilt, balcony seating was added.   The facade was repainted with Art Deco graphics and a large mural was painted on the back of the theater.  Capacity was increased to 765.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre balcony restoration in 1991.jpg|thumb|180px|The balcony was remodeled in March 1991 revealing the theater's original 35 mm film projection  port.]]

The balcony was extended in 1981.

In 1984 the theater cinema's 765 seats were removed and sold  and the sloped auditorium floor was [[Terrace (stadium)|terraced]].&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  Buffet dinner tables for 400 and balcony tables for 100 were added.  The [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|backstage]] area was remodeled, and the balcony was restored back to its original shape.  Exterior [[drainage]] was improved.

The degraded ceiling plasterwork was repaired and repainted, the roof was replaced and wiring were upgraded in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maupin1988 /&gt;  External air conditioning was being pumped in.

By 1991 the balcony was renovated and re-extended and the [[70 mm film]] projection room under the balcony had been removed and the air conditioning repaired.  Opera boxes were installed on the second floor of either side of the stage and the DJ booth was relocated shortly thereafter.

[[File:Beacham Theatre restoration proposal.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Facade restoration proposal for the Beacham Theatre]]

As the Beacham was renovated to become Dekkos's in 1992, it was discovered that the stucco sheeting that was installed during a modernization in 1954 could not be economically removed without severely damaging the original facade underneath.  Restoration plans for the facade had to be modified.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;
An arched molding was then added to the facade.  A [[sunburst]] and red neon lighting was subsequently added.

Following an effort to "bring back the [[aesthetics]] of the old Beacham Theatre," in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate [[plaster]] ceiling moldings, [[facade]], and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated.  The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting [[Building restoration|restoration]] and is being stored on the roof.&lt;ref name= Emmons2000 /&gt;

Around 2005, the facade was modified by removing a small semi-circular molding in front of the sunburst.  The points of the [[sunburst]] were also removed leaving a large semi-circular molding and larger arch above it decorating the facade.

[[File:Beacham Theatre facade in 2015.jpg|thumb|180px|Beacham Theatre's facade was in poor condition between 2014 and 2016.]]

====Recent Changes====

The balcony and upstairs areas were [[Renovation|remodeled]] in 2011 with a beautifully painted ceiling and the addition of two [[chandeliers]].  [[Public toilet|Restroom]]s were installed in place of the theater's original office area and [[35 mm film]] [[projection booth]].  The theater's ornate plaster ceilings are in a state of disrepair with the decorative ceiling concealed behind a black cloth barrier that can retain any pieces of plaster that might fall.

During the summer months of 2016 the crumbling arched molding was removed from the facade.  The facade was then repaired and repainted and new red and blue neon lighting was installed.  Further restoration in the near future is in a discussion and planning stage.

==Notable performances ==

[[Vaudeville]] acts that have performed at the Beacham Theatre include the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], [[John Phillip Sousa]], [[W.C.

==Early life==
Baroni was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. [[Catholic Charities]] arranged for him to be adopted by William Sr. and Geraldine Baroni of [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey]] a few days later.

He attended [[wikipedia:Steinert_High_School#Notable_alumni|Steinert High School]] in Hamilton, New Jersey.

He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[George Washington University]] in history and was awarded a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].&lt;ref name=NJLEG&gt;[http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=298 Senator Baroni's legislative web page], [[New Jersey Legislature]]. Accessed April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Baroni became interested in politics as a teenager, working on the campaign of his hometown congressman, [[Christopher H. Smith]] (R), who was seeking re-election to his fourth term.  He was also a driver for Assembly Speaker [[Chuck Haytaian]] in his campaign for U.S. Senator against [[Frank Lautenberg]] in 1994 and worked on the advance staff for the 1996 presidential campaign of [[Steve Forbes]].

He served on the [[Mercer County Community College]] Board of Trustees from 1998 to 2003. He was a member of the [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton Township]] Planning Board from 1998 to 2000.

In 2003, Baroni mounted an aggressive campaign for the General Assembly, knocking on over 10,000 doors to defeat the Democratic incumbent Gary Guear.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Diane C. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=10109CF3BB695F2B&amp;p_docnum=2&amp;p_queryname=NaN&amp;p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_theme=aggregated4&amp;p_nbid=C60Q5EGVMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg "Getting votes one at a time: Baroni builds ties with constituents"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', February 29, 2004. Accessed August 10, 2007. "Knocking on more than 10,000 doors in Mercer and Middlesex counties helped Republican Bill Baroni win the 14th District Assembly race last fall when so many of his GOP colleagues were left by the wayside.... The hostilities from the fall campaign, when Baroni ousted Greenstein's running mate have faded somewhat. Greenstein's staffers even attended the meeting at Pierre's."&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected to the Assembly in 2005. In 2004 and 2005, he was the Assembly's Assistant Parliamentarian.&lt;ref name=NJLEG/&gt;

On November 6, 2007, he won election to become State Senator of the 14th Legislative District. He captured 62.3% of the vote, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] opponent Seema Singh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200711080314.htm "Indian-American Chivukula wins New Jersey Assembly polls"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026065811/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200711080314.htm |date=October 26, 2012 }}, ''[[The Hindu]]'', November 8, 2007.

Accessed March 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been speculation that Baroni would seek the Republican nomination for [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2008|2008]] against Frank Lautenberg,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/starledger/stories/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1168149037272840.xml&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=4/The Star Ledger "People to Watch in 2007: Bill Baroni"], accessed January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but his run for the [[New Jersey Senate]] effectively ended that speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politickernj.com/baroni-out-doherty-may-be-front-runner-08 |title=With Baroni out, Doherty may be front runner for '08 |work=PolitickerNJ.com |date=March 26, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, when U.S. Senator [[Robert Torricelli]] withdrew his candidacy for re-election five weeks before Election Day after the Senate admonished him on ethics charges, Baroni argued for the Republicans in the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] against a last-minute switch of candidates to Frank Lautenberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/07/elec02.nj.s.race/ Supreme Court won't intervene in N.J. case: 'Let the campaign begin'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716121808/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/07/elec02.nj.s.race/ |date=July 16, 2006 }}, [[CNN]], October 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie===
On February 19, 2010, the [[Governor of New Jersey]], [[Chris Christie]], announced that he was appointing Baroni to the position of Deputy Executive Director of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the new post on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Port Authority executive Bill Baroni starts powerful job, learns how to 'tweet' |url=http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2010/03/06/news/doc4b91d73416254754550304.txt |work=[[The Trentonian]] |date=March 6, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Goodwin (New Jersey politician)|Tom Goodwin]] was selected to fill the vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamilton councilman wins N.J.

On December 12, 2013, Christie announced that Baroni had resigned as Deputy Executive Director of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. This occurred after the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|scandal over lane closures at the George Washington Bridge]], perhaps to punish Democratic Fort Lee Mayor [[Mark Sokolich]] for not supporting Christie.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/state/Top_Christie_apointee_resigns_amid_escalating_probe_into_George_Washington_Bridge_lane_closuers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later email disclosures indicate that Baroni attempted to squelch press that the lane closures were improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soltis |first=Andy |date=January 10, 2014 | title=Christie appointee ordered officials’ silence on Bridgegate |url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/10/traffic-study-done-during-bridgegate-showed-chaos-it-caused/ |publisher=New York Post|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2014, Baroni was named as a defendant in a federal [[class action]] [[lawsuit]]s in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey]] which cited a [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]] and "willful, wanton, arbitrary, and egregious [[official misconduct]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|last=Markos |first=Kirbet |date=January 9, 2014 | url=http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Six_Bergen_County_residents_file_class-action_lawsuits_against_Christie.html| title=Six Bergen County residents file class-action lawsuits over GWB scandal|work=The Record |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2015 he was indicted on nine federal counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges.&lt;ref name=NJ.indicted/&gt; to which he pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/bridgegate_kelly_baroni_in_federal_court.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is contesting the District Attorney's decision not to release certain documents in the discovery process to mount his defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-scandal-baroni-lawyers-say-prosecutors-request-aimed-at-protecting-christie-inner-circle-1.1354255&lt;/ref&gt; A continuance for the trial was granted in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/bridgegate_corruption_trial_delayed_until_next_yea.html&lt;/ref&gt; Baroni was also a FBI informant, Baroni's secret life as an FBI informant came out in opening statements of his trial. He provided detail saying he met about every other month with an FBI agent to give him information and "context" about what was going on in Trenton for about 6 years starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/highlights_of_bill_baronis_bridgegate_testimony.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Fat Kid Got Fit'' ==

Along with a childhood friend, Baroni co-authored ''Fat Kid Got Fit, and So Can You'', a 2012 book chronicling Baroni's early struggles with obesity and his successful efforts to overcome the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2012/02/21/life/doc4f443281f14da358517433.txt "NY/NJ Port Authority boss and ex-fatso Bill Baroni pens book 'Fat Kid Got Fit, and So Can You'", Trentonian, Published 21 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Baroni wrote the book because he wants others to know that his successful weight loss came from “being healthy and working out” and that other people could share similar success.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Bunyip 1890.jpg|thumb|A bunyip depicted in 1890]]
'''Bunyip aristocracy''' is an Australian term satirising attempts to develop an aristocracy in the colonies now forming that country. It was first coined in 1853 by [[Daniel Deniehy]] who made a speech lambasting the attempt by [[William Wentworth]] to establish a titled [[aristocracy]] in the [[New South Wales]] government. This speech came to be known as the ''Bunyip Aristocracy speech''.

Deniehy made speeches opposing the new self-titled Australian aristocracy in the Victorian theatre and on the [[soapbox]] at [[Circular Quay]].

In response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary [[peerage]] in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: "''Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the [[platypus|duck-billed platypus]], and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a "bunyip aristocracy.''" (The [[bunyip]] is an Ancestral Being of [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Aboriginal Dreaming]].) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.

Among those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was [[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James MacArthur]] (1798–1867), the son of [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John MacArthur]], who had been nominated to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] (the lower house was only created in 1856): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to the [[Rum Rebellion]] in which [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] played a major role.&lt;/ref&gt; of a New South Wales order of chivalry.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The [[Order of Australia]] was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded [[British honours system|British honours]].

'Bunyip aristocracy' is now a [[pejorative]] term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bunyip aristocracy definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTLSSN?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dan Deniehy's Bunyip aristocracy speech ==

''Note: Deniehy had a habit of writing speeches and articles that addressed himself in the third person''

{{Quotation|Mr. Deniehy seconded the resolution [that this meeting pledges itself to resist, by every constitutional means in its power, the formation of a second chamber which is not based on popular suffrage]. Why he had been selected to speak to the present resolution he knew not, save that as a native of the colony he might naturally be expected to feel something like real interest, and to speak with something like real feeling on a question connected with the political institutions of the country. He would do his best to respond to that invitation 'Speak up,' and would perhaps balance deficiencies flowing from a small volume of voice by in all cases calling things by their right names.

He protested against the present daring and unheard-of attempt to tamper with a fundamental popular right – that of having a voice in the nomination of men who were to make, or control the making of, laws binding on the community – laws perpetually shifting and changing the nature of the whole social economy of a given state, and frequently operating in the subtlest forms on the very dearest interests of the citizen – on his domestic, his moral, perhaps his religious relations.

The name of Mr. Wentworth had frequently been mentioned there that day, and that on one or two occasions with an unwise tenderness, a squeamish reluctance to speak plain, English, and call certain nasty doings of Mr. Wentworth by the usual homely appellatives, simply because they were Mr. Wentworth's. He for one was nowise disposed, as preceding speakers had seemed, in tapping the vast shoulder of Mr. Wentworth's political recreancies, to '[[Damn with faint praise|damn him with faint praise]] and mistimed eulogy.

He had listened from boyhood upwards to grey tradition, Mr. Wentworth's demagogic Areopagitas – his speeches for the liberty of unlicensed printing regime of Darling; and for these and divers other deeds of a time when the honourable member for Sydney had to the full his share of the chivalrous pugnacities of five-and-twenty, he was as much disposed to give Mr Wentworth credit as any man. But with these perpetual fantasies, these everlasting variations on the 'Light of the other Days,' continually ringing in his ears, he [Dan Deniehy] was fain to enquire by what rule of moral and political appraisal, it was sought to throw in a scale opposite to that containing the flagrant and shameless political dishonesty of years, the democratic escapades, sins long since repented of in early youth.

The subsequent political conduct-rather the systemic political principles of Mr. Wentworth – had been such as would have been sufficient to cancel the value of even a century of action. The British Constitution had been frequently spoken of that afternoon in terms of unbounded laudation. That Constitution certainly deserved to be spoken of with respect; he [Dan Deniehy] respected it, no doubt they all respected it.

But his was a qualified respect at best, and in all presumed assimilations of the political hypotheses of our colonial Constitution-makers with the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|Constitution of Great Britain]], he warned them not be seduced by mere words and phrases-sheer 'talkee talkee.' Relatively, it was not only an admirable example of slowly growing and gradually elaborated political experience, applied, set in action, but it was also eminent and exemplary as a long history, still evolving, of political philosophy. But it was after all but relatively good for its wonderfully successful fusion of principles the most antagonistic.

Circumstances entirely alter cases, and he would warn them to be seduced by no mere vague association exhaled from the use of venerable phrases, that had, what phrases now-a-days seldom could boast, genuine meanings attached to them. The patrician element existed in the British Constitution as did the regal, for good reasons-it had stood in the way of all late legislatorial thought and operation as a great fact; as such it was handled, and in a deep and prudential spirit of conservatism allowed to stand-but as affecting the basis and foundation of the architecture of a Constitution-the elective principle neutralised for all detrimental influence, by conversion, practically, into a mere check upon the deliberations of the initiative section of the Legislature.

And having the right to frame, to embody, to shape it as we would, with no great stubborn facts to work upon as in England, there was nothing but the elective principle and the inalienable freedom of every colonist upon which to work out the whole organisation and body of our political institution.

But because it was the good pleasure of Mr. Wentworth and the respectable tail of that puissant Legislative body, whose serpentine movements were so ridiculous, we were not to form our own Constitution, but instead of this we were to have an Upper House and a Constitution cast upon us, upon a pattern which should suit the taste and propriety of political oligarchs who treated the people at large as if they were cattle to be bought and sold in the market; or as they indeed were in American slave States, and now in Australian markets, where we might find bamboozled coolies and kidnapped Chinamen.

And being in a figurative humour, he might endeavour to make some of the proposed nobility to pass before the stage of our imagination, as the ghost of Banquo walked along in the vision of Macbeth, so that we might have a fair view of these Harlequin aristocrats, these Botany Bay magnificos (laughter), these Australian mandarins.

Let them walk across the stage in all the pomp and circumstances of hereditary titles. First, then, in the procession stalks the hoary Wentworth. But he could not imagine that to such a head the strawberry leaves [a reference to the decoration on a Duke's coronet] would add any honour.

Next came the native aristocrat Mr. James Macarthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green- (great cheers and laughter) -and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry. There was also the colonial starred Terence Aubrey Murray, with more crosses and orders-not perhaps orders of merit-than a state of mandarinhood.

Another friend who claimed a colonial title was George Robert Nichols, the hereditary Grand Chancellor of all the Australias. Behold him in the serene and moody dignity of that portrait of Rodius' that smiled on us in all the public – house parlours – the gentleman who took Mr. Lowe to task for altering his opinions; this conqueror in the lists of jaw, and the victor in the realms of gab. It might be well to ridicule the doings of such a clique, but their doings merited burning indignation-yet, to speak seriously of such a project would too much resemble the Irishman's kicking at nothing, it wrenched one horribly.

But, though their weakness was ridiculous, he could assure them that these pygmies might do a great deal of mischief. They would bring contempt on a country whose interest he was sure they all had at heart, until even the poor Irishman in the streets of Dublin would fling his jibe at the Botany Bay aristocrats. In fact, he was puzzled how to classify them. They could not aspire to the miserable and effete dignity of the grandees of Spain.

They had antiquity of birth, but these he would defy any naturalist properly to classify them. But perhaps it was only a specimen of the remarkable contrariety that existed at the Antipodes. Here they all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulations of this degeneration, he supposed they were to be favoured with a '''bunyip aristocracy'''.

He trusted that this was only the beginning of a more extended movement, and from its auspicious commencement he augured the happiest results. A more orderly, united, and consolidated movement he had never witnessed. He must say that he was proud to belong to Botany Bay.

He took it as no term of reproach, when he saw that there was such a keen sensibility on the subject of their political sights – that the instant the liberties of their country were threatened, they could assemble, and with one voice, declare their determined and undying opposition.

But he would remind them that this was not a selfish consideration, there were wider interests at stake. In the present disturbed state of Europe, they must calculate on having to receive the poor Russian flying from the [[knout]] of his oppressor.

And also, looking at the gradually increasing pressure of political parties at home, they must prepare to open their arms and receive the fugitives from England, Scotland, and Ireland, who would hasten to gain a security and a competence, that appeared to be denied them in their own country.

The interests of these countless thousands were involved in their decision on this occasion, and they looked, and were entitled to look, for a heritage befitting the dignity of free men. Bring them not here with delusive hopes-let them not find a new-fangled aristocracy haunting these free shores.

But it is to yours to offer them a land, where man is rewarded for his labour, and where the law no more recognises the supremacy of a class, than it recognises the predominance of a religion. But there is an aristocracy worthy of our ambition. Wherever man's skill is eminent, wherever glorious manhood asserts its elevation, there is an aristocracy that confers honour on the land that possesses it. That is God's aristocracy.

That is an aristocracy that will grow and expand under free institutions, and bless the land where it flourishes. He hoped they would take into consideration the hitherto barren condition of the country they were legislating for. He was a native of this young but glorious continent. Its past was not hallowed in history by the achievements of men whose names reflected a light on the times in which they lived. They had no long line of poets, of statesmen, and warriors; in this country art had done nothing, but nature everything. It was theirs to inaugurate the future.

In no country had the attempt been successfully made to manufacture an aristocracy ''pro re nata''. It could not be done. They might as well expect honour to be paid to the nobles of King Kamehameha, or the ebony earls of the Emperor Soulouque of Hayti.

The aristocracy of England was founded on the sword. The men that came over with William the Conqueror were the masters of the Saxons, and so were the aristocracy. The soldiers of Cromwell were the masters of the Irish, and so became their aristocracy. But he should like to know how Wentworth and his clique had conquered the inhabitants of New South Wales – except in the artful dodgery of doctoring up a Franchise Bill.

If we were to be blessed with an aristocracy he would rather it should not resemble that of William the Bastard but of Jack the Strapper.

But he trespassed too long on their time and would only seek in conclusion, but to record two things. First, his indignant denunciation of any tampering with the purity of the elective principle, the only basis upon which good government could be placed; and, secondly, he wished them to regard the future destinies of their country.

Let them, with prophetic eye, behold the troops of weary pilgrims, from foreign despotism, which would, ere long, be floating to their shores, and let them now – give the most earnest assurance, that such men as composed the Wentworth clique, were not the representations of the spirit, the intelligence, of the freemen of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Martin1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Alfred Martin|title=The life and speeches of Daniel Henry Deniehy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjciBDj5JIgC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=18 December 2012|year=1884|publisher=McNeil and Coffee|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial peerage==

A Committee, consisting of Messrs. [[Charles Cowper]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray|T.A. Murray]], [[George Macleay]], [[Edward Deas Thomson|E. Deas Thomson]], J.H. Plunkett, Dr. Douglas, W. Thurlow, James Macarthur, [[James Martin (Australian politician)|James Martin]], and W.C. Wentworth, appointed on the motion of W.C.Wentworth, held its first meeting, Sydney, 27 May 1853. Fifteen meetings were called. Half the members did not attend the meetings. The Bill was reported 28 July 1853. It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs :
* A committee of the Legislative Council has framed a new Constitution for the colony, by which it is proposed 
**(1.) To create a colonial nobility with hereditary privileges.
**(2.) To construct an Upper House of Legislature in which the people will have no voice.
**(3.) To add eighteen new seats to the Lower House, only one of which is to be allotted to Sydney while the other seventeen are to be allotted among the country and squatting districts.
**(4.) To squander the public revenue by pensioning off the officers of the Government on their full salaries ! thus implanting in our institutions a principle of jobbery and corruption.
**(5.) To fix irrevocably on the people this oligarchy in the name of free institutions so that no future Legislature can reform it even by absolute majority. The Legislative Council has the hardihood to propose passing this unconstitutional and anti-British measure with only a few days notice, and before it can possibly be considered by the colonists at large.  
The meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, J.H. 1984, The Bedside Book of Colonial Doings, previously published in 1879 as 'Australian Dictionary of Dates containing the History of Australasia from 1542 to May 1879, pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Prospect theory}}
The '''certainty effect''' is the psychological effect resulting from the reduction of probability from certainty to probable {{harv|Tversky|Kahneman|1986}}. It is an idea introduced in [[prospect theory]]. 

Normally a reduction in the probability of winning a reward (e.g., a reduction from 80% to 20% in the chance of winning a reward) creates a psychological effect such as displeasure to individuals, which leads to the perception of loss from the original probability thus favoring a risk-averse decision. However, the same reduction results in a larger psychological effect when it is done from certainty than from uncertainty.

==Example==
{{harvtxt|Tversky|Kahneman|1986}} illustrated the certainty effect by the following examples.

First, consider this example:

Which of the following options do you prefer?
*A. a sure gain of $30
*B. 80% chance to win $45 and 20% chance to win nothing

In this case, 78% of participants chose option A while only 22% chose option B. This demonstrates the typical risk-aversion phenomenon in [[prospect theory]] and [[framing effect]] because the expected value of option B ($45x0.8=$36) exceeds that of A by 20%.

Now, consider this problem:

Which of the following options do you prefer?

*C. 25% chance to win $30 and 75% chance to win nothing
*D. 20% chance to win $45 and 80% chance to win nothing

In this case, 42% of participants chose option C while 58% chose option D. 

As before, the expected value of the first option ($30x0.25=$7.50) was 20% lower than that of option D ($45x0.2=9) however, when neither option was certain, risk-taking increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7827">'''Clinical equipoise''', also known as the '''principle of equipoise''', provides the ethical basis for medical research that involves assigning patients to different treatment arms of a [[clinical trial]]. The term was first used by Benjamin Freedman in 1987.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;Freedman, B. (1987) 'Equipoise and the ethics of clinical research'. ''The New England Journal of Medicine'', 317, (3):141–145.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, clinical equipoise means that there is genuine uncertainty in the expert medical community over whether a treatment will be beneficial. This applies also for off-label treatments performed before or during their required clinical trials.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

An ethical dilemma arises in a clinical trial when the investigator(s) begin to believe that the treatment or intervention administered in one arm of the trial is significantly outperforming the other arms. A trial should begin with a [[null hypothesis]], and there should exist no decisive [[Empirical evidence|evidence]] that the intervention or drug being tested will be superior to existing treatments or effective at all. As the trial progresses, the findings may provide sufficient evidence to convince the investigator of the intervention or drug’s efficacy. Once a certain threshold of evidence is passed, there is no longer genuine uncertainty about the most beneficial treatment, so there is an ethical imperative for the investigator to provide the superior intervention to all participants. Ethicists contest the location of this evidentiary threshold, with some suggesting that investigators should only continue the study until they are convinced that one of the treatments is better, and with others arguing that the study should continue until the evidence convinces the entire expert medical community.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The extent to which major research ethics policies endorse clinical equipoise varies. For instance, the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique/initiatives/tcps2-eptc2/Default/|title=Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans|last=TCPS2|first=|date=|website=Panel of Research Ethics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorses it; whereas, the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) does not. With regard to clinical equipoise in practice, there is evidence that industry-funded studies disproportionately favor the industry product, suggesting unfavorable conditions for clinical equipoise. In contrast, a series of studies of national cancer institute funded trials suggests an outcome pattern consistent with clinical equipoise.&lt;ref&gt;Djulbegovic, B. (2009) The Paradox of Equipoise: The Principle That Drives and Limits Therapeutic Discoveries in Clinical Research. ''Cancer Control'', 16, (4): 342–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shaw and Chalmers argued early on that "If the clinician knows, or has good reason to believe, that a new therapy (A) is better than another therapy (B), he cannot participate in a comparative trial of Therapy A versus Therapy B. Ethically, the clinician is obligated to give Therapy A to each new patient with a need for one of these therapies."&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, L., A.M. &amp; T. Chalmers, M.D. (1970) 'Ethics in Cooperative Clinical Trials'. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 169, 487–495.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers would thus face an ethical dilemma if they wanted to continue the study and collect more evidence, but had compelling evidence that one of the tested therapies was superior. They further stated that any results should be withheld from the researchers during the trial until completion to avoid this ethical dilemma and ensure the study’s completion.

This method proved to be difficult in modern research, where many clinical trials have to be performed and analyzed by experts in that field.  Freedman proposed a different approach to this ethical dilemma called '''clinical equipoise'''.  Clinical equipoise occurs "if there is genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community&amp;nbsp;— not necessarily on the part of the individual investigator&amp;nbsp;— about the preferred treatment."&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt; Clinical equipoise is distinguished from '''theoretical equipoise''', which requires evidence on behalf of the alternative treatments to be exactly balanced and thus yields a very fragile epistemic threshold for favoring one treatment over the other. Theoretical equipoise could be disturbed, for example, by something as simple as anecdotal evidence or a hunch on the part of the investigator. Clinical equipoise allows investigators to continue a trial until they have enough statistical evidence to convince other experts of the validity of their results, without a loss of ethical integrity on the part of the investigators.

Equipoise is also an important consideration in the design of a trial from a patient’s perspective. This is especially true in [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) for [[surgical]] interventions, where both trial and control arms are likely to have their own associated risks and hopes for benefits. The condition of the patient is also a factor in these risks. Ensuring that trials meet the standards of clinical equipoise is an important part of patient recruitment in this regard; it is likely that past trials that did not meet conditions of clinical equipoise suffered from poor recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Lilford, R. et al. 'Trials in surgery', ''British Journal of Surgery'', (2004), 91, 6–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Miller and Brody argue that the notion of clinical equipoise is fundamentally misguided. The ethics of therapy and the ethics of research are two distinct enterprises that are governed by different norms. They state, “The doctrine of clinical equipoise is intended to act as a bridge between therapy and research, allegedly making it possible to conduct RCTs without sacrificing the therapeutic obligation of physicians to provide treatment according to a scientifically validated standard of care. This constitutes [[therapeutic misconception]] concerning the ethics of clinical trials, analogous to the tendency of patient volunteers to confuse treatment in the context of RCTs with routine medical care.”&lt;ref&gt;Miller, F. G. and H. Brody. 'A Critique of Clinical Equipoise: Therapeutic Misconception in the Ethics of Clinical Trials', ''The Hastings Center Report'', (2003), 33, (3): 19–28&lt;/ref&gt; Equipoise, they argue, only makes sense as a normative assumption for clinical trials if one assumes that researchers have therapeutic obligations to their research participants. 
Further criticisms of clinical equipoise have been leveled by Robert Veatch&lt;ref&gt;Veatch, R. ‘The Irrelevance of Equipoise’, ''Journal of Medical Philosophy'', (2007), 32, (2): 167–183&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Ubel and Robert Silbergleit.&lt;ref&gt;Ubel, P. and Robert Silbergleit .‘Behavioral Equipoise: A Way to Resolve Ethical Stalemates in Clinical Research’, ''The American Journal of Bioethics'', (2011), 11, (2): 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Military Police Corps (United States)|United States Army Military Police Corps]] defines criminal intelligence in more detail; '''criminal intelligence''' is information gathered or collated, analyzed, recorded/reported and disseminated by law enforcement agencies concerning types of [[crime]], identified criminals and known or suspected criminal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm;jsessionid=2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ!99557122|title=Field Manual (FM) 3-19.50 - Police Intelligence Operations (2006)|work=rdl.train.army.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002859/https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm%3Bjsessionid%3D2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ%2199557122|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly useful when dealing with [[organized crime]]. Criminal intelligence is developed by using [[surveillance]], [[informant]]s, [[interrogation]], and [[research]], or may be just picked up on the "street" by individual [[police]] officers.

Some larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a [[computer]] system) which can be "mined" (searched) for specific information.

==US Army usage==
Criminal intelligence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential [[criminal]] threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (''CRIMINT'') and human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"&gt;FM 3-19.13 LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CRIMINT Process==
The CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into [[intelligence]] products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.

* CRIMINT planning and directing.
* CRIMINT collection and reporting.
* CRIMINT processing.
* Analysis and production.
* Dissemination and integration.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"/&gt;

== Criminal intelligence analysis ==
''Criminal intelligence analysis'' has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police ([[INTERPOL]]), European Police ([[EUROPOL]]) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071005230215/http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-05|title=International Police (INTERPOL) (2010)|work=interpol.int|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than [[criminology]].

== Criminal investigation analysis software ==
There are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is [[link analysis]] which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16092">'''Debiasing''' is the reduction of bias, particularly with respect to [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|judgment and decision making]]. [[List of cognitive biases|Biased judgment and decision making]] is that which systematically deviates from the prescriptions of objective standards such as facts, logic, and [[Rational choice theory|rational behavior]] or prescriptive [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Biased judgment and decision making exists in consequential domains such as medicine, law, policy, and business, as well as in everyday life. [[disposition effect|Investors, for example, tend to hold onto falling stocks too long and sell rising stocks too quickly]]. Employers exhibit considerable discrimination in hiring and employment practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=0 | title=Racial Bias, Even When We Have Good Intentions | work=The New York Times | date=January 3, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2016 | author=Mullainathan, Sendhil}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many parents continue to believe that vaccinations cause autism despite knowing that this link is based on falsified evidence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Morewedge|first1 = C.

Debiasing can occur within the decision maker. For example, a person may learn or adopt better strategies by which to make judgments and decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larrick|first1=Richard|title=Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-4051-0746-4|pages=316|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debiasing can also occur as a result of changes in external factors, such as changing the incentives relevant to a decision or the manner in which the decision is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunstein|first1=Richard H. Thaler, Cass R.|title=Nudge : improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300122237|edition=Revised and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three general approaches to debiasing judgment and decision making, and the costly errors with which biased judgment and decision making is associated: changing [[incentive]]s, [[Nudge theory|nudging]], and training. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses. For more details, see Morewedge and colleagues (2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== General approaches ==

=== Incentives ===
Changing [[incentive]]s can be an effective means to debias judgment and decision making. This approach is generally derived from [[Rational choice theory|economic theories]] suggesting that people act in their self-interest by seeking to maximize their utility over their lifetime. Many decision making biases may occur simply because they are more costly to eliminate than to ignore.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Costs and benefits of judgment errors: Implications for debiasing.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.486|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 486–498|volume = 110|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.486|first = Hal R.|last = Arkes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making people more accountable for their decisions (increasing incentives), for example, can increase the extent to which they invest cognitive resources in making decisions, leading to less biased decision making when people generally have an idea of how a decision should be made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lerner|first1=Jennifer S.|last2=Tetlock|first2=Philip E.|title=Accounting for the effects of accountability.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1999|volume=125|issue=2|pages=255–275|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "bias" might not be the appropriate term for these types of decision making errors.  These "strategy-based" errors occur simply because the necessary effort outweighs the benefit.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If a person makes a suboptimal choice based on an actual bias, then incentives may exacerbate the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An incentive in this case may simply cause the person to perform the suboptimal behavior more enthusiastically.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Incentives can be calibrated to change preferences toward more beneficial behavior. Price cuts on healthy foods increase their consumption in school cafeterias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=SA|title=Pricing effects on food choices.|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=2003|volume=133|issue=3|pages=841S-843S|pmid=12612165|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/3/841S.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soda taxes appear to reduce soda consumption by the public. People often are willing to use incentives to change their behavior through the means of a commitment device. Shoppers, for example, were willing to forego a cash back rebate on healthy food items if they did not increase the percentage of healthy foods in their shopping baskets.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=J.|last2=Mochon|first2=D.|last3=Wyper|first3=L.|last4=Maroba|first4=J.|last5=Patel|first5=D.|last6=Ariely|first6=D.|title=Healthier by Precommitment|journal=Psychological Science|date=3 January 2014|volume=25|issue=2|pages=538–546|doi=10.1177/0956797613510950|pmid=24390824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incentives can backfire when they are miscalibrated or are weaker than social norms that were preventing undesirable behavior. Large incentives can also lead people to choke under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariely|first1=Dan|last2=Gneezy|first2=Uri|last3=Loewenstein|first3=George|last4=Mazar|first4=Nina|title=Large Stakes and Big Mistakes|journal=Review of Economic Studies|date=April 2009|volume=76|issue=2|pages=451–469|doi=10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00534.x|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/SITE/archive/SITE_2006/Web%20Session%207/Ariely_Paper.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202540/http://web.stanford.edu/group/SITE/archive/SITE_2006/Web%20Session%207/Ariely_Paper.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nudges ===
[[Nudge theory|Nudges]], changes in information presentation or the manner by which judgments and decisions are elicited, is another means to debiasing. People may choose healthier foods if they are better able to understand their nutritional contents,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The impact of traffic light color-coding on food health perceptions and choice.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xap0000049|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|pages = 255–275|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/xap0000049|first = Remi|last = Trudel|first2 = Kyle B.|last2 = Murray|first3 = Soyoung|last3 = Kim|first4 = Shuo|last4 = Chen|date= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may choose lower-calorie meals if they are explicitly asked if they would like to downsize their side orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=J.|last2=Riis|first2=J.|last3=Elbel|first3=B.|last4=Ariely|first4=D.|title=Inviting Consumers To Downsize Fast-Food Portions Significantly Reduces Calorie Consumption|journal=Health Affairs|date=8 February 2012|volume=31|issue=2|pages=399–407|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of nudges include changing which option is the [[Default effect (psychology)|default]] option to which people will be assigned if they do not choose an alternative option, placing [[Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule|a limit on the serving size of soda]], or automatically enrolling employees in a retirement savings program.

=== Training ===
Training can effectively debias decision makers over the long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How a Video Game Helped People Make Better Decisions|url = https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-a-video-game-helped-people-make-better-decisions|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judgment and Decision Making as a Skill: Learning, Development and Evolution|last = Dhami|first = Mandeep|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9781107676527|location = |pages = |url = http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/judgment-and-decision-making-skill-learning-development-and-evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training, to date, has received less attention by academics and policy makers than incentives and nudges because initial debiasing training efforts resulted in mixed success (see Fischhoff, 1982 in Kahneman et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Debiasing|first1=Baruch|last1=Fischhoff|editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521284141|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Judgment_Under_Uncertainty.html?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;pg=PA422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Decision makers could be effectively debiased through training in specific domains. For example, experts can be trained to make very accurate decisions when decision making entails [[Recognition primed decision|recognizing patterns and applying appropriate responses]] in domains such as firefighting, chess, and weather forecasting. Evidence of more general debiasing, across domains and different kinds of problems, however, was not discovered until recently. The reason for the lack of more domain-general debiasing was attributed to experts failing to recognize the underlying "deep structure" of problems in different formats and domains. Weather forecasters are able to predict rain with high accuracy, for example, but show the same overconfidence in their answers to basic trivia questions as other people. An exception was graduate training in scientific fields heavily reliant on statistics such as psychology.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching reasoning|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/238/4827/625|journal = Science|date = 1987-10-30|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 3672116|pages = 625–631|volume = 238|issue = 4827|doi = 10.1126/science.3672116|first = R.

Experiments by Morewedge and colleagues (2015) have found interactive computer games and instructional videos can result in long-term debiasing at a general level. In a series of experiments, training with interactive computer games that provided players with personalized feedback, mitigating strategies, and practice, reduced six cognitive biases by more than 30% immediately and by more than 20% as long as three months later. The biased reduced were anchoring, bias blind spot, confirmation bias, fundamental attribution error, projection bias, and representativeness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Training in [[reference class forecasting]] may also improve outcomes. Reference class forecasting is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] calls the [[outside view]]. As pointed out by Kahneman in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] (p. 252), one of the reasons reference class forecasting is effective for debasing is that, in contrast to conventional forecasting methods, it takes into account the so-called "[[unknown unknowns]]." According to Kahneman, reference class forecasting is effective for debiasing and "has come a long way" in practical implementation since he originally proposed the idea with Amos Tversky (p. 251).

== Sometimes effective strategies ==

=== Incentives ===
* Paying people for optimal behavior through bonuses or by providing discounts (e.g., to exercise, to take their medication, to trade in fuel inefficient vehicles such as the "[[Car Allowance Rebate System|cash for clunkers]]" program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of accuracy motivation on anchoring and adjustment: Do people adjust from provided anchors?|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0021540|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 917–932|volume = 99|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/a0021540|first = Joseph P.|last = Simmons|first2 = Robyn A.|last2 = LeBoeuf|first3 = Leif D.|last3 = Nelson|pmid=21114351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxing people for suboptimal behavior (e.g., drinking soda, smoking tobacco, and weed).

=== Nudges ===
* Using [[default effect]] to [[nudge theory|nudge people]] towards decisions optimal for the decision maker or society.
* [[Commitment device]]s that makes it more costly to make suboptimal decisions (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2014&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;). 
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Reframing]] choice options in ways that make important attributes salient. Labeling hamburger meat 25% fat, for example, makes people more sensitive to fat content than labeling it 75% lean. 
* Presenting information in formats that make critical information easier to evaluate, such as displaying nutritional value using a "traffic light" system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Training ===
* Providing people with personalized feedback regarding the direction and degree to which they exhibit bias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Teaching a "consider-the-alternative" strategy, such as considering a plausible alternative reason for an event than cause one suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=Edward R.|last2=Markman|first2=Keith D.|title=Multiple explanation: A consider-an-alternative strategy for debiasing judgments.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1069–1086|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching people statistical reasoning and normative rules of which they are unaware.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Encouraging people to take the perspective of a person who will experience the consequences of their decision can reduce bias. Participants who were shown a "morphed" image of their face to resemble themselves upon retirement were more likely to save money for the future rather than elect to receive it in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Increasing Saving Behavior Through Age-Progressed Renderings of the Future Self|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S23|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = 2011-11-01|issn = 0022-2437|pmc = 3949005|pmid = 24634544|pages = S23-S37|volume = 48|issue = SPL|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S23|first = Hal E|last = Hershfield|first2 = Daniel G|last2 = Goldstein|first3 = William F|last3 = Sharpe|first4 = Jesse|last4 = Fox|first5 = Leo|last5 = Yeykelis|first6 = Laura L|last6 = Carstensen|first7 = Jeremy N|last7 = Bailenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage, incentivize, or make mandatory the use of [[reference class forecasting]]. [[Reference class forecasting]] was made mandatory in Great Britain and Denmark for large government infrastructure projects with the explicit purpose of eliminating [[optimism bias]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1694">A '''design competition''' is a [[competition]] in which an entity solicits design proposals from the public for a specified purpose.

==Architecture==
An [[architectural design competition]] solicits architects to submit design proposals for a building, bridge, or other structure. Such competitions may be ''open'', receiving bids internationally, domestically, or regionally. The competition may occur in a single stage, or involve two stages, the first of which eliminates non-viable candidates.

Famous early examples of design competitions were for the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in 448 BCE, and the dome of the [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1418.

==Coins and stamps==
Coin and stamp design contests solicit designs to appear on the face of stamps and usually the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of coins. In 1998, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] held the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a competition for the design of 24 [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarters]], one for each month of 1999 and 2000.&lt;!-- was this a project of the Millennium Bureau of Canada ? --&gt;

==Monuments and sculptures==
The design of artistic objects and monuments is a common subject in design competitions. A well-known example is the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]] designed by [[Maya Lin]].

==Urban space==
Urban and landscape projects may solicit design proposals in a competition. Among them are projects for urban parks, streetscapes, and rehabilitation of natural areas.

==Student design competition==
A [[student design competition]] is a [[student competition]] to introduce students to real-world engineering practices and design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10031">[[Image:Bergson-Nobel-photo.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|Henri Bergson in 1927.]]

'''Duration''' (French: ''la durée'') is a theory of [[time]] and [[consciousness]] posited by the [[France|French]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]]. Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of [[Herbert Spencer]], due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of [[mechanics]], which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete. For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same. Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]].&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt; Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture. It can only be grasped through a simple [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]] of the imagination.&lt;ref name="Henri Bergson pages 165"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 165 to 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson first introduced his notion of duration in his essay ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness''. It is used as a defense of [[free will]] in a response to [[Immanuel Kant]], who believed free will was only possible outside time and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''Time and Free Will has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to Kant and Zeno==
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|Immanuel Kant, who believed [[free will]] was only a pragmatic belief.]]

[[Zeno of Elea]] believed reality was an uncreated and indestructible immobile whole.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenides, ''On Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated [[Zeno's paradoxes|four paradoxes]] to present mobility as an impossibility. We can never, he said, move past a single point because each point is infinitely divisible, and it is impossible to cross an infinite space.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', VI:9, 239b10.&lt;/ref&gt; But to Bergson, the problem only arises when mobility and time, that is, duration, are mistaken for the spatial line that underlies them. Time and mobility are mistakenly treated as things, not progressions.  They are treated retrospectively as a thing's spatial trajectory, which can be divided ''ad infinitum'', whereas they are, in fact, an indivisible whole.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Matter and Memory'', pages 191 to 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson’s response to Kant is that free will is possible within a duration within which time resides. Free will is not really a problem but merely a common confusion among philosophers caused by the immobile time of science.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', Author's Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; To measure duration (''durée''), it must be translated into the immobile, spatial time (''temps'') of science, a translation of the unextended into the extended. It is through this translation that the problem of free will arises. Since space is a homogeneous, quantitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]], duration becomes juxtaposed and converted into a succession of distinct parts, one coming after the other and therefore "caused" by one another. Nothing within a duration can be the cause of anything else within it. Hence [[determinism]], the belief everything is determined by a prior cause, is an impossibility. One must accept time as it really is through placing oneself within duration where freedom can be identified and experienced as pure mobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''For Bergson — and perhaps this is his greatest insight — freedom is mobility.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images of duration==

In ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'', Bergson presents three images of duration. The first is of two spools, one unrolling to represent the continuous flow of ageing as one feels oneself moving toward the end of one's life-span, the other rolling up to represent the continuous growth of memory which, for Bergson, equals consciousness. No two successive moments are identical, for the one will always contain the memory left by the other. A person with no memory might experience two identical moments but, Bergson says, that person's consciousness would thus be in a constant state of death and rebirth, which he identifies with unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 164 to 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of two spools, however, is of a homogeneous and commensurable thread, whereas, according to Bergson, no two moments can be the same, hence duration is heterogeneous.

Bergson then presents the image of a spectrum of a thousand gradually changing shades with a line of feeling running through them, being both affected by and maintaining each of the shades. Yet even this image is inaccurate and incomplete, for it represents duration as a fixed and complete spectrum with all the shades spatially juxtaposed, whereas duration is incomplete and continuously growing, its states not beginning or ending but intermingling.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', page 163: ''Strictly speaking they do not constitute multiple states until I have already got beyond them, and turn around to observe their trail. [...] In reality, none of them begins or ends; they all dovetail into one another.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Instead, let us imagine an infinitely small piece of elastic, contracted, if that were possible, to a mathematical point. Let us draw it out gradually in such a way as to bring out of the point a line which will grow progressively longer. Let us fix our attention not on the line as line, but on the action which traces it. Let us consider that this action, in spite of its duration, is indivisible if one supposes that it goes on without stopping; that, if we intercalate a stop in it, we make two actions of it instead of one and that each of these actions will then be the indivisible of which we speak; that it is not the moving act itself which is never indivisible, but the motionless line it lays down beneath it like a track in space. Let us take our mind off the space subtending the movement and concentrate solely on the movement itself, on the act of tension or extension, in short, on pure mobility. This time we shall have a more exact image of our development in duration.''|20px|20px|[[Henri Bergson]]|''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 164 to 165.}}

Even this image is incomplete, because the wealth of colouring is forgotten when it is invoked.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt; But as the three images illustrate, it can be stated that duration is qualitative, unextended, multiple yet a unity, mobile and continuously interpenetrating itself. Yet these concepts put side-by-side can never adequately represent duration itself;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The truth is we change without ceasing...there is no essential difference between passing from one state to another and persisting in the same state. If the state which "remains the same" is more varied than we think, [then] on the other hand the passing of one state to another resembles—more than we imagine—a single state being prolonged: the transition is continuous.  Just because we close our eyes to the unceasing variation of every physical state, we are obliged when the change has become so formidable as to force itself on our attention, to speak as if a new state were placed alongside the previous one. Of this new state we assume that it remains unvarying in its turn and so on endlessly.''&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, Creative Evolution (1911) tr. Arthur Mitchell, Henry Holt and Company&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because a qualitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] is heterogeneous and yet interpenetrating, it cannot be adequately represented by a symbol; indeed, for Bergson, a qualitative multiplicity is inexpressible. Thus, to grasp duration, one must reverse habitual modes of thought and place oneself within duration by intuition.&lt;ref name="Henri Bergson pages 165"/&gt;

==Physics and Bergson’s ideas==
Bergson’s ideas concerning the [[philosophy of time]] were somewhat rediscovered after a paper 
on Zeno’s paradox was published in ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' and generated interest in 2003. The writer, Peter Lynds, was credited with producing an original new insight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/aug/14/research.highereducation ''The strange story of Peter Lynds''] - David Adam, The Guardian, Thursday 14 August 2003 02.41 BST&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was noted in a journal article shortly after that the ideas in this paper were preceded by Henri Bergson, evidently unbeknownst to Lynds or his paper's referees.&lt;ref&gt;S E Robbins (2004) On time, memory and dynamic form. Consciousness and Cognition 13(4), 762-788: "Lynds, his reviewers and consultants (e.g., J.J.C. Smart) are apparently unaware of his total precedence by Bergson"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecosocial Theory''', first proposed by name in 1994 by [[Nancy Krieger]] of the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]],&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?" Social Science and Medicine 1994; 39:887-903&lt;/ref&gt; is a broad and complex theory with the purpose of describing and explaining causal relationships in [[disease spread|disease distribution]].  While it incorporates biological and [[psychosocial]] influences on disease occurrence, the theory is also suited to analyze the relationships between social factors and disease development in [[public health]] research.  The core constructs of Ecosocial Theory are: Embodiment; Pathways to Embodiment; the cumulative interplay between exposure, resistance, and susceptibility; and agency and accountability.&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy"&gt;Krieger, Nancy (2011). Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the theory specifies that all constructs must be considered in concert, as they work together in a synergistic explanation of disease distribution.  The theory assumes that distributions of disease are determined at multiple levels and that analyses must incorporate historical, political economic, temporal, and spatial analyses.

== Key constructs ==

The key constructs of Ecosocial Theory are:&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy" /&gt;
# embodiment
# pathways to embodiment
# the cumulative interplay of exposure, susceptibility, and resistance
# agency and accountability
All of these constructs work together and must be understood in order to assess the impact of multiple levels of influence on the distribution of disease in populations.  Embodiment describes the literal physical incorporation of the social and biological world into an individual’s body.  Embodiment is an active process (a verb-like noun), in that the relationship between bodies and the world around them is reciprocal, cyclical, and synergistic.  Pathways to Embodiment describes the various ways that social, biological, and environmental forces may interact with an individual’s body in context.  Pathways must be explored on various spatio-temporal scales in order to understand the complex interplays that can occur through history, inter-generationally, across the lifecourse; as well as at global, national, societal, familial, and molecular levels.  Cumulative Interplay describes how patterns of disease occur within a social, ecological, and biological context.  It emphasizes how individuals in different socio-economic positions have different exposures, susceptibilities, and resistance (both biological and political) to disease, based on their unique histories and experiences over the lifecourse, based on spatio-temporal factors and the interaction with groups, power structures, discrimination, and inequality.  Agency and Accountability claims that the State is a responsible agent in the patterns of disease distribution in a given society.  In contrast to biomedical and lifestyle theories of disease distribution, the social system that creates discrimination and inequalities are also responsible for patterns of disease.  Further, Krieger expands this construct to include the accountability we as epidemiologists have in the identification and treatment of health disparities, and the obligation we have to explicitly identify our theoretical lens, as well as to become activists, not just researchers, when we observe injustice.

== History ==

The theory was influenced by the work of proponents of Social Medicine in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[Louis-René Villermé]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Karl Marx]]; as well as by the more recent work of [[Social Production of Disease]] (SPD) theorists, including [[Sydenstricker]], [[Daniel S. Goldberg|Goldberg]], and [[Davey-Smith]].  The theory of Social Production of Disease (SPD) explains the way that capitalist societies of the 21st century tend to value consumption over production and wealth over the well-being of their citizens.  The roots of SPD lie in the research and writings of Villerme, Virchow, and Engels, who discussed the poor working conditions and diseases of working class Europeans around the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 19th century.  In the U.S. in the 1930s, the statistician Sydenstrickker examined how poor living and working conditions could cause disease in impoverished populations, and used daily living data to determine proximal biological causes of these population-level disease distributions.  Thereafter, both medicine and epidemiology were overtaken by biomedical and lifestyle theories of disease, which explained population level patterns as mere aggregates of events taking place at the cellular level within individuals.  Social factors in epidemiology were largely ignored until Doyal, Navarro, and others proposed the theories of SPD and Political Economy of Health in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="DoyalLesley"&gt;Doyal, Lesley, and Imogen Pennell. The political economy of health. Pluto Pr, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and Krieger later integrated these theories into her writings on Ecosocial Theory (1994, 2011).  As described by Doyal, SPD consists of the following key constructs: (1) The distribution of disease in a population will pattern along social, economic, and political lines in a given society. (2) The State is at least partly responsible for the health of its citizens. (3) Increases in life expectancy in developed countries have been at the expense of the health of less developed countries. (4)  Societies valuing profit, consumption, capitalism, and wealth over the well-being of their people and environments will reflect these priorities in the unequal distribution of disease in the poor and disempowered classes.&lt;ref name="DoyalLesley" /&gt;

Ecosocial Theory builds on these theories by incorporating biological explanations, a lifecourse perspective, and a multilevel perspective over space and time, to describe associations between exposures and disease, with an explicit focus on inequalities in health status among subjugated groups.

According to Ecosocial Theory, as influenced by writings on SPD, it is both consumption and production at the societal level that contributes to patterns of disease.  The distribution of income, access to healthcare, education, and occupation is not equal in most societies; and often follows power dynamics that repress women, people of color, sexual minorities, and other discriminated groups.  Patterns of health and disease follow this socio-political ordering, and determine in part the distribution of disease in societies over time.&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy" /&gt;

== Examples of the application of Ecosocial Theory ==

As an example, rates of obesity are not evenly distributed in the United States.  People with lower [[socio-economic position]] (SEP) tend to have higher rates of obesity, on average; as do populations of African Americans, some Hispanics, and American Indians.  These differential rates by group cannot be explained by genetics or biology alone, as it is obvious that not all people with low SES or from racial/ethnic minority populations are obese, and there is no clear genetic link which could possibly explain the dramatic rise in obesity prevalence seen in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Rather, social factors must be used to explain these disparities.
Taking a historical perspective, we can begin to describe the high rates of obesity seen among African Americans in the so-called “stroke belt” of the Southern U.S.  The history of slavery in this region helps in part to explain food culture among African Americans, since high calorie and fat foods were essential to the enslaved ancestors working on plantations.  The culture of food created in this setting, and transmitted over the centuries, still exists today, however the social and physical environment in which people live has changed dramatically.  Rather than spending hours in the hot sun doing physical labor for work, 21st century Americans often have jobs which are largely sedentary.  Cities and suburbs have developed around automobiles as the major means of transportation rather than walking or biking.  And fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages, and television have overtaken many areas and lives.  In addition, U.S. government subsidies support corn growers in producing corn syrup, and successful corporations often market food that is easy, convenient, full of fat and calories, and cheap.  For African Americans in the South who still suffer from economic discrimination due to this history of racism, non-nutritious foods are often the only affordable options in the food deserts in which they live.  At multiple levels of political and social order then, we see using Ecosocial Theory that history, policy, culture, and the social and built environments drive the inequalities in the distribution of obesity seen in African Americans today.  This places agency and accountability at the structural and socio-historical level, rather than on obese individuals themselves.

Similar analyses can be examined in multiple generations of Hispanic immigrants as they acculturate to the United States, American Indians and their history of abuse and repression in this country, and people of low SEP.  Ecosocial Theory could also help us examine how these social forces and pathways become embodied and incorporated into the physiological outcome of obesity over the lifecourse, for example by looking at dietary patterns during pregnancy and how this affects risk of obesity to the fetus as it ages and grows into an adult with an altered metabolism from early exposure.

[[File:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[zipa]]'' used to cover his body in gold dust, and from his [[Muisca raft|raft]], he offered treasures to the ''[[Guatavita]]'' goddess in the middle of the sacred lake. This old Muisca tradition became the origin of the legend of El Dorado.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;This Muisca raft figure is on display in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá]], Colombia.&lt;/small&gt;]]
'''''El Dorado''''' ({{IPA-es|el doˈɾaðo|pron}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|ɛ|l|_|d|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|d|oʊ|}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the [[gold]]en one"), originally ''El Hombre Dorado'' ("The Golden Man") or ''El Rey Dorado'' ("The Golden King"), was the term used by the [[Spanish Empire]] to describe a [[mythical]] tribal chief (''zipa'') of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] native people in then Spanish colonial province of [[Colombia]], who, as an initiation rite, covered himself with [[gold]] dust and submerged in [[Lake Guatavita]]. The legends surrounding El Dorado changed over time, as it went from being a man, to a city, to a kingdom, and then finally to an empire.

A second location for El Dorado was inferred from rumors, which inspired several unsuccessful expeditions in the late 1500s in search of a city called Manõa on the shores of [[Lake Parime]]. Two of the most famous of these expeditions were led by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]. In pursuit of the legend, Spanish [[conquistadors]] and numerous others searched Colombia, Venezuela, and parts of Guyana and northern Brazil for the city and its fabulous king. In the course of these explorations, much of northern South America, including the [[Amazon River]], was mapped. By the beginning of the 19th century, most people dismissed the existence of the city as a myth.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"&gt;[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html Humboldt, Alexander von, ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799-1804,'' (chapter 25). Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several literary works have used the name in their titles, sometimes as "El Dorado", and other times as "Eldorado".

== Muisca ==
{{main|Muisca people|Muisca mythology}}

The Muisca occupied the highlands of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] departments of Colombia in two migrations from outlying lowland areas, one starting c. 1270 BCE, and a second between 800 BCE and 500 BCE. At those times, other more ancient civilizations also flourished in the highlands. The [[Muisca Confederation]] was as advanced as the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] civilizations.&lt;ref name="Ocampo"&gt;Ocampo López, Javier. 2007. ''Grandes culturas indígenas de América'' [Great indigenous cultures of the Americas], Plaza &amp; Janes Editores Colombia S.A..&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Muisca mythology|mythology of the Muisca]], Mnya the Gold or golden color, represents the energy contained in the trinity of [[Chiminigagua]], which constitutes the creative power of everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.culturarecreacionydeporte.gov.co/bogotanitos/cuenta-la-leyenda/chiminichagua-o-el-ser-supremo Chiminichagua, o el ser supremo]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiminigagua is related to [[Bachué]], [[Cuza (god)|Cuza]], [[Chibchacum]], [[Bochica]], and [[Nencatacoa]].

===The tribal ceremony===
The original narrative can be found in the rambling chronicle ''[[El Carnero]]'' of [[Juan Rodriguez Freyle]]. According to Freyle, the ''zipa'' of the Muisca, in a ritual at [[Lake Guatavita]] near present-day [[Bogotá]], was said to be covered with gold dust, which he then washed off in the lake while his attendants threw objects made of gold, emeralds, and precious stones into the lake - such as [[tunjo]]s.

In 1638, Freyle wrote this account of the ceremony, addressed to the ''[[cacique]]'' or governor of [[Guatavita]]:{{refn|"Era costumbre entre estos naturales que el que había de ser sucesor y heredero del señorío o cacicazgo de su tío, a quien heredaba, había de ayunar seis años metido en una cueva que tenían dedicada y señalada par esto, y que en todo este tiempo no había de tener parte con mujeres, ni comer carne, sal ni ají y otras cosas que les vedaban; y entre ellas que durante el ayuno no habían de ver el sol, sólo de noche tenían licencia para salir de la cueva y ver la luna y estrellas y recogerse antes que el sol los viese. Y cumplido este ayuno y ceremonias se metían en posesión del cacicazgo o señorío, y la primera jornada que habían de hacer era ir a la gran laguna de Guatavita a ofrecer y sacrificar al demonio ([[sic]]) que tenían por su dios y señor. La ceremonia que en esto había era que en aquella laguna se hacía una gran balsa de juncos, aderezábanla y adornábanla todo lo más vistoso que podían, metían en ella cuatro [[braseros]] encendidos en que desde luego quemaban mucho moque, que es el sahumerio de estos naturales, y trementina, con otros muchos y diversos perfumes. Estaba a este tiempo toda la laguna en redondo, con ser muy grande, y hondable de tal manera que puede navegar en ella un navío de alto bordo, la cual estaba toda coronada de infinidad de indios e indias, con mucha plumería, chagualas y coronas de oro, con infinitos fuegos a la redonda; y luego que en la balsa comenzaba el sahumerio lo encendían en tierra, en tal manera, que el humo impedía la luz del día.

A este tiempo desnudaban al heredero en carnes vivas y lo untaban con una tierra pegajosa y lo espolvoreaban con oro en polvo y molido, de tal manera que iba cubierto todo de este metal. Metíanle en la balsa, en la cual iba parado, y a los pies le ponían un gran montón de oro y esmeraldas para que ofreciese a su dios. Entraban con él en la balsa cuatro caciques, los más principales, sus sujetos, muy aderezados de plumería, coronas de oro, brazales y chagualas y orejeras de oro, también desnudos, y cada cual llevaba su ofrecimiento. En partiendo la balsa de tierra comenzaban los instrumentos, cornetas, fotutos y otros instrumentos, y con esto una gran vocería que atronaba montes y valles y duraba hasta que la balsa llegaba al medio de la laguna, de donde, con una bandera, se hacía señal para el silencio.

Hacía el indio dorado su ofrecimiento echando todo el oro que llevaba a los pies en el medio de la laguna, y los demás caciques que iban con él y le acompañaban hacían lo propio, lo cual acabado abatían la bandera, que en todo el tiempo que gastaban en el ofrecimiento la tenían levantada, y partiendo la balsa a tierra comenzaba la grita, gaitas y fotutos con muy largos corros de bailes y danzas a su modo, con la cual ceremonia recibían al nuevo electo y quedaba conocido por señor y príncipe.

De esta ceremonia se tomó aquel nombre tan celebrado del Dorado, que tantas vidas ha costado."|group=Note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Juan Rodríguez|last=Freyle|title=Conquista y descubrimiento del Nuevo Reino de Granada [El Carnero]|year=1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ceremony took place on the appointment of a new ruler. Before taking office, he spent some time secluded in a cave, without women, forbidden to eat salt, or to go out during daylight. The first journey he had to make was to go to the great lagoon of Guatavita, to make offerings and sacrifices to the demon which they worshipped as their god and lord. During the ceremony which took place at the lagoon, they made a raft of [[Juncaceae|rushes]], embellishing and decorating it with the most attractive things they had. They put on it four lighted braziers in which they burned much moque, which is the incense of these natives, and also resin and many other perfumes. The lagoon was large and deep, so that a ship with high sides could sail on it, all loaded with an infinity of men and women dressed in fine plumes, golden plaques and crowns. ... As soon as those on the raft began to burn incense, they also lit braziers on the shore, so that the smoke hid the light of day.

At this time, they stripped the heir to his skin, and anointed him with a sticky earth on which they placed gold dust so that he was completely covered with this metal. They placed him on the raft ... and at his feet they placed a great heap of gold and emeralds for him to offer to his god. In the raft with him went four principal subject chiefs, decked in plumes, crowns, bracelets, pendants and ear rings all of gold. They, too, were naked, and each one carried his offering ... when the raft reached the centre of the lagoon, they raised a banner as a signal for silence.

The gilded Indian then ... [threw] out all the pile of gold into the middle of the lake, and the chiefs who had accompanied him did the same on their own accounts. ... After this they lowered the flag, which had remained up during the whole time of offering, and, as the raft moved towards the shore, the shouting began again, with pipes, flutes and large teams of singers and dancers. With this ceremony the new ruler was received, and was recognised as lord and king.

This is the ceremony that became the famous El Dorado, which has taken so many lives and fortunes.}}

There is also an account, titled ''The Quest of El Dorado'', by poet-priest and historian of the Conquest [[Juan de Castellanos]], who had served under Jiménez de Quesada in his campaign against the Muisca, written in the mid-16th century but not published until 1850:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castellanos|first=Juan de|year=1850|title=Elejias de Varones Ilustres de Indias| section=Parte III, Canto II|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|An alien Indian, hailing from afar,
Who in the town of Quito did abide.
And neighbor claimed to be of Bogata,
There having come, I know not by what way,
Did with him speak and solemnly announce
A country rich in emeralds and gold.

Also, among the things which them engaged,
A certain king he told of who, disrobed,
Upon a lake was wont, aboard a raft,
To make oblations, as himself had seen,
His regal form overspread with fragrant oil
On which was laid a coat of powdered gold
From sole of foot unto his highest brow,
Resplendent as the beaming of the sun.

Arrivals without end, he further said,
Were there to make rich votive offerings
Of golden trinkets and of emeralds rare
And divers other of their ornaments;
And worthy credence these things he affirmed;
The soldiers, light of heart and well content,
Then dubbed him ''El Dorado'', and the name
By countless ways was spread throughout the world.}}

According to Spanish historian [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] (1478–1557):

&lt;blockquote&gt;He went about all covered with powdered gold, as casually as if it were powdered salt. For it seemed to him that to wear any other finery was less beautiful, and that to put on ornaments or arms made of gold worked by hammering, stamping, or by other means, was a vulgar and common thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Muisca territories, there were a number of natural locations considered sacred, including lakes, rivers, forests and large rocks. People gathered here to perform rituals and sacrifices mostly with gold and emeralds. Important lakes were [[Lake Guatavita]], [[Lake Iguaque]], [[Lake Fúquene]], [[Lake Tota]], the [[Siecha Lakes]], Lake Teusacá and [[Ubaque#Lake Ubaque|Lake Ubaque]].&lt;ref name="Ocampo" /&gt;

==From ritual to myth and metaphor==
El Dorado is applied to a legendary story in which precious stones were found in fabulous abundance along with gold coins. The concept of El Dorado underwent several transformations, and eventually accounts of the previous myth were also combined with those of a legendary lost city. The resulting El Dorado myth enticed European explorers for two centuries. Among the earliest stories was the one told on his deathbed by Juan Martinez, a captain of munitions for Spanish adventurer [[Diego de Ordaz]], who claimed to have visited the city of Manoa. Martinez had allowed a store of gunpowder to catch fire and was condemned to death, however his friends let him escape downriver in a canoe. Martinez then met with some local people who took him to the city:

{{quote|The canoa [sic] was carried down the stream, and certain of the Guianians met it the same evening; and, having not at any time seen any Christian nor any man of that colour, they carried Martinez into the land to be wondered at, and so from town to town, until he came to the great city of Manoa, the seat and residence of Inga the emperor. The emperor, after he had beheld him, knew him to be a Christian, and caused him to be lodged in his palace, and well entertained. He was brought thither all the way blindfold, led by the Indians, until he came to the entrance of Manoa itself, and was fourteen or fifteen days in the passage. He avowed at his death that he entered the city at noon, and then they uncovered his face; and that he traveled all that day till night through the city, and the next day from sun rising to sun setting, ere he came to the palace of Inga. After that Martinez had lived seven months in Manoa, and began to understand the language of the country, Inga asked him whether he desired to return into his own country, or would willingly abide with him. But Martinez, not desirous to stay, obtained the favour of Inga to depart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2272/2272-h/2272-h.htm Sir Walter Raleigh, ''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana''] (1596; repr., Amsterdam: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fable of Juan Martinez was founded on the adventures of Juan Martin de Albujar, well known to the Spanish historians of the Conquest; and who, in the expedition of Pedro de Silva (1570), fell into the hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Europeans, still fascinated by the New World, believed that a hidden city of immense wealth existed. Numerous expeditions were mounted to search for this treasure, all of which ended in failure. The illustration of El Dorado's location on maps only made matters worse, as it made some people think that the city of El Dorado's existence had been confirmed. The mythical city of El Dorado on [[Lake Parime]] was marked on numerous maps until its existence was disproved by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] during his Latin America expedition (1799–1804).

Meanwhile, the name of ''El Dorado'' came to be used metaphorically of any place where wealth could be rapidly acquired. It was given to [[El Dorado County, California]], and to towns and cities in various states. It has also been anglicized to the single word ''Eldorado'', and is sometimes used in product titles to suggest great wealth and fortune, such as the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] line of [[Luxury vehicle|luxury automobiles]].

[[File:1599 Guyana Hondius.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Nieuwe caerte van het Wonderbaer ende Goudrjcke Landt Guiana'' by Jodocus Hondius (1598) shows the city of Manoa on the northeastern shore of [[Lake Parime]]]]
El Dorado is also sometimes used as a metaphor to represent an ultimate prize or "[[Holy Grail]]" that one might spend one's life seeking. It could represent true love, heaven, happiness, or success. It is used sometimes as a figure of speech to represent something much sought after that may not even exist, or, at least, may not ever be found. Such use is evident in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem ''"El Dorado".'' In this context, El Dorado bears similarity to other myths such as the [[Fountain of Youth]] and [[Shangri-la]]. The other side of the ideal quest metaphor may be represented by ''Helldorado'', a satirical nickname given to [[Tombstone, Arizona]] (United States) in the 1880s by a disgruntled miner who complained that many of his profession had traveled far to find El Dorado, only to wind up washing dishes in restaurants.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The South African city [[Johannesburg]] is commonly interpreted as a modern-day El Dorado, due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the [[Witwatersrand]] on which it is situated.

== Gold and greed ==
Spanish conquistadores had noticed the native people's fine artifacts of gold and silver long before any legend of "golden men" or "lost cities" had appeared.  The prevalence of such valuable artifacts, and the natives' apparent ignorance of their value, inspired speculation as to a plentiful source for them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Prior to the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] and discovery of Lake Guatavita, a handful of expeditions had set out to explore the lowlands to the east of the Andes in search of gold, cinnamon, precious stones, and anything else of value. During the [[Klein-Venedig]] period in Venezuela (1528–1546), agents of the German [[Welser]] banking family (which had received a concession from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]) launched repeated expeditions into the interior of the country in [[Klein-Venedig#The search for El Dorado|search of gold]], starting with [[Ambrosius Ehinger]]'s first expedition in July 1529.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Spanish explorer [[Diego de Ordaz]], then governor of the eastern part of Venezuela known as Paria (named after [[Paria Peninsula]]), was the first European to explore the [[Orinoco river]] in 1531–32 in search of gold. A veteran of Hernán Cortés's campaign in Mexico, Ordaz followed the Orinoco beyond the mouth of the [[Meta River]] but was blocked by the rapids at [[Atures Municipality|Atures]]. After his return he died, possibly poisoned, on a voyage back to Spain.&lt;ref name = "Hemming"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Gold.html?id=_JEJAQAAIAAJ John Hemming, ''Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians, 1500-1760,'' Harvard University Press, 1978.] {{ISBN|0674751078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the death of Ordaz while returning from his expedition, the Crown appointed a new Governor of Paria, Jerónimo de Ortal, who diligently explored the interior along the [[Meta River]] between 1532 and 1537. In 1535, he ordered captain Alonso de Herrera to move inland by the waters of the Uyapari River (today the town of Barrancas del Orinoco). Herrera, who had accompanied Ordaz three years before, explored the Meta River but was killed by the indigenous [[Achagua people|Achagua]] near its banks, while waiting out the winter rains in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== The search for El Dorado ==

The earliest reference to the name ''El Dorado'' was in 1535 or 1536, before Spanish contact with the Muisca people.
[[File:Musterung-Welser-Armada.png|thumb|200px|Inspection of the Welser army by [[Georg von Speyer]] (right) and Philipp von Hutten (center) at [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]].]]
Between 1531 and 1538, the German conquistadors [[Nikolaus Federmann]] and [[Georg von Speyer]] searched the Venezuelan lowlands, Colombian plateaus, Orinoco Basin and [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]] for El Dorado.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, James Grant; Fiske, John, eds. (1900). [[s:Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography/Spire, Georg von|"Spire, Georg von"]]. in ''Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography.'' New York: D. Appleton.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Philipp von Hutten]] accompanied Von Speyer on a journey (1536–38) in which they reached the headwaters of the [[Rio Japura]], near the equator. In 1541 Hutten led an exploring party of about 150 men, mostly horsemen, from [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] on the coast of [[Venezuela]] in search of the Golden City. After several years of wandering, harassed by the natives and weakened by hunger and fever, he crossed the Rio Bermejo, and went on with a small group of around 40 men on horseback into [[Los Llanos (South America)|Los Llanos]], where they engaged in battle with a large number of [[Omaguas]] and Hutten was severely wounded. He led those of his followers who survived back to Coro in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz36173.html "Hutten, Philipp (Felipe Dutre, de Utre, de Ure), Conquistador, 1511 – 24.4.1546 in Venezuela." Deutsche Biographie]&lt;/ref&gt; On Hutten's return, he and a traveling companion, [[Bartholomeus VI. Welser]], were executed in [[El Tocuyo]] by the Spanish authorities.

In 1535, Captains Anasco and Ampudia were dispatched by Spanish conquistador [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], one of Francisco Pizarro's chief lieutenants, to discover the valley of ''Dorado'' in pursuit of the splendid riches of the Zaque, or chieftain of Cundinamarca, described by a wandering Indian of Tacumga.

In 1536 Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda had led an expedition to the lowlands to the east of [[Quito]] and had found cinnamon trees but no rich empire.

=== Quesada brothers' expeditions ===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}} 
In 1536, stories of El Dorado drew the Spanish conquistador [[Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada]] and his army of 800 men away from their mission to find an overland route to Peru and up into the Andean homeland of the Muisca for the first time. The southern Muisca settlements and their treasures quickly fell to the [[conquistador]]s in 1537 and 1538. On the [[Bogotá savanna]], the Spanish received reports from captured natives about El Dorado and the initiation rite of the new ''[[zipa]]'', which used to take place in Lake Guatavita.{{Specify|when?|date=February 2014}} The Spanish captured large amounts of gold from the Muisca, which led them to spread the word that El Dorado was near.

After his brother Gonzalo had left for Spain in May 1539, Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada]] set out a new expedition in September 1540, leaving with 270 Spanish soldiers and countless indigenous porters to explore the [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]]. One of his main captains on this journey was [[Baltasar Maldonado]]. Their expedition was unsuccessful and after reaching Quito, the troops returned to Santafe de Bogotá.&lt;ref name = "Hemming"/&gt;

=== Pizarro and Orellana's discovery of the Amazon ===
{{See also|Amazon River#History}}
In 1540, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], the younger half-brother of [[Francisco Pizarro]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] who toppled the [[Incan Empire]] in Peru, was made the governor of the province of [[Quito]] in northern [[Ecuador]].  Shortly after taking lead in Quito, Gonzalo learned from many of the natives of a valley far to the east rich in both [[cinnamon]] and gold.  He banded together 340 soldiers and about 4000 natives in 1541 and led them eastward down the [[Coca River|Rio Coca]] and [[Napo River|Rio Napo]]. [[Francisco de Orellana]] accompanied Pizarro on the expedition as his lieutenant. Gonzalo quit after many of the soldiers and natives had died from hunger, disease, and periodic attacks by hostile natives.  He ordered Orellana to continue downstream, where he eventually made it to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The expedition found neither cinnamon nor gold, but Orellana is credited with discovering the [[Amazon River]] (so named because of a [[Amazons|tribe of female warriors]] that attacked Orellana's men while on their voyage).

=== Expeditions of Pedro de Ursúa and Lope de Aguirre ===
In 1560, Basque ''conquistadors'' [[Pedro de Ursúa]] and [[Lope de Aguirre]] journeyed down the [[Marañón River (Peru)|Marañón]] and [[Amazon River]]s, in search of El Dorado, with 300 Spaniards and hundreds of natives;&lt;ref name="PastorCallau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beatriz Pastor|author2=Sergio Callau|title=Lope de Aguirre y la rebelión de los marañones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19ADt-_oYZIC&amp;pg=PA1524|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Parkstone International|isbn=978-84-9740-535-5|pages=1524–1525}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual goal of Ursúa was to send idle veterans from the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] away, to keep them from trouble-making, using the El Dorado myth as a lure. A year later, Aguirre participated in the overthrow and killing of Ursúa and his successor, Fernando de Guzmán, whom he ultimately succeeded.&lt;ref name="DouglassBilbao2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A.

While the existence of a sacred lake in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Andes, associated with Indian rituals involving gold, was known to the Spaniards possibly as early as 1531, its location was only discovered in 1537 by conquistador [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] while on an expedition to the highlands of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the [[Andes]] in search of gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saexplorers.org/system/files/magazine/sae-mag-8g-lake-guatavita.pdf John Hemming, "The Draining of Lake Guatavita."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conquistadores]] Lázaro Fonte and Hernán Perez de Quesada attempted (unsuccessfully) to drain the lake in 1545 using a "bucket chain" of labourers. After 3 months, the water level had been reduced by 3 metres, and only a small amount of gold was recovered, with a value of 3000–4000 [[peso]]s (approx. US$100,000 today; a peso or [[Spanish dollar|piece of eight]] of the 15th century weighs 0.88&amp;nbsp;oz of 93% pure silver).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A later more industrious attempt was made in 1580, by Bogotá business entrepreneur Antonio de Sepúlveda. A notch was cut deep into the rim of the lake, which managed to reduce the water level by 20 metres, before collapsing and killing many of the labourers. A share of the findings—consisting of various golden ornaments, jewellery and armour—was sent to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]]. Sepúlveda's discovery came to approximately 12,000 pesos. He died a poor man, and is buried at the church in the small town of [[Guatavita]].

In 1801, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] made a visit to Guatavita, and on his return to Paris, calculated from the findings of Sepúlveda's efforts that Guatavita could offer up as much as $300 million worth of gold.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt;

In 1898, the Company for the Exploitation of the Lagoon of Guatavita was formed and taken over by Contractors Ltd. of London, in a deal brokered by British expatriate Hartley Knowles. The lake was drained by a tunnel that emerged in the centre of the lake. The water was drained to a depth of about 4 feet of mud and slime.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This made it impossible to explore, and when the mud had dried in the sun, it had set like concrete. Artifacts worth only about £500 were found, and auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] of London. Some of these were donated to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=15311&amp;plaA=15311-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The company filed for bankruptcy and ceased activities in 1929.

In 1965, the Colombian government designated the lake as a protected area.  Private salvage operations, including attempts to drain the lake, are now illegal.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== Antonio de Berrio's expeditions ===
The Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Antonio de Berrio (nephew of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada), made three failed expeditions to look for El Dorado. Between 1583 and 1589 he carried out his first two expeditions, going through the wild regions of the Colombian plains and the Upper Orinoco. In 1590 he began his third expedition, ascending the Orinoco to reach the [[Caroní River]] with his own expeditionaries and another 470 men under command of [[:ne:Domingo de Vera|Domingo de Vera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Robert|title=Lives of the British Admirals: Robert Devereux.

Berrio took them to the territories he had previously explored by himself years before. After several months Raleigh's expedition returned to Trinidad, and he released Berrio at the end of June 1595 on the coast of [[Cumaná]] in exchange for some English prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Walter Ralegh's Discoverie of Guiana,'' Hakluyt Society, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. {{ISBN|0904180875}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Fernando de Berrío y Ourña (1577–1622) also made numerous expeditions in search of El Dorado.

{{Further|Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition}}

[[Walter Raleigh]]'s 1595 journey with Antonio de Berrio had aimed to reach [[Lake Parime]] in the highlands of [[Guyana]] (the supposed location of El Dorado at the time). He was encouraged by the account of Juan Martinez, believed to be Juan Martin de Albujar, who had taken part in Pedro de Silva's expedition of the area in 1570, only to fall into the hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco. Martinez claimed that he was taken to the golden city in blindfold, was entertained by the natives, and then left the city and couldn't remember how to return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washmapsociety.org/000/0/9/8/22890/userfiles/file/Lake_Parime.pdf Eliane Dotson, "Lake Parime and the Golden City."]&lt;/ref&gt; Raleigh had set many goals for his expedition, and believed he had a genuine chance at finding the so-called city of gold. First, he wanted to find the mythical city of El Dorado, which he suspected to be an actual Indian city named Manõa. Second, he hoped to establish an English presence in the Southern Hemisphere that could compete with that of the Spanish. His third goal was to create an English settlement in the land called Guyana, and to try to reduce commerce between the natives and Spaniards.

In 1596 Raleigh sent his lieutenant, [[Lawrence Kemys]], back to Guyana in the area of the Orinoco River, to gather more information about the lake and the golden city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter7.html "Raleigh's Second Expedition to Guiana."]&lt;/ref&gt; During his exploration of the coast between the Amazon and the Orinoco, Kemys mapped the location of Amerindian tribes and prepared geographical, geological and botanical reports of the country. Kemys described the coast of Guiana in detail in his ''Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana'' (1596)&lt;ref name = "Laughton"&gt;[[s:Kemys, Lawrence (DNB00)|John Knox Laughton, "Kemys, Lawrence" ''Dictionary of National Biography,'' 1885-1900, Volume 30.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that indigenous people of Guiana traveled inland by canoe and land passages towards a large body of water on the shores of which he supposed was located Manoa, Golden City of El Dorado.

Though Raleigh never found El Dorado, he was convinced that there was some fantastic city whose riches could be discovered. Finding gold on the riverbanks and in villages only strengthened his resolve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/raleighsam/283 ''Sir Walter Raleigh.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1617, he returned to the New World on a second expedition, this time with Kemys and his son, Watt Raleigh, to continue his quest for El Dorado. However, Raleigh, by now an old man, stayed behind in a camp on the island of [[Trinidad]]. Watt Raleigh was killed in a battle with Spaniards and Kemys subsequently committed suicide.&lt;ref name = "Laughton"/&gt; Upon Raleigh's return to England, [[James VI and I|King James]] ordered him to be beheaded for disobeying orders to avoid conflict with the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Drye, Willie. [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]. [http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/el-dorado ''El Dorado Legend Snared Sir Walter Raleigh.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  He was executed in 1618.

=== Post-Elizabethan expeditions ===
In early 1611 [[Sir Thomas Roe]], on a mission to the [[West Indies]] for [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], sailed his 200-ton ship, the ''Lion's Claw'', some {{convert|320|km|mi}} up the Amazon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-01882011000100016&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en#nt1 Alírio Cardoso, "The conquest of Maranhão and Atlantic disputes in the geopolitics of the Iberian Union (1596-1626)," ''Rev. Bras. Hist.'' vol.31 no.61, São Paulo,  2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; then took a party of canoes up the Waipoco (probably the [[Oyapock River]]) in search of Lake Parime, negotiating thirty-two rapids and traveling about one hundred miles before they ran out of food and had to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;James Seay Dean, ''Tropics Bound: Elizabeth's Seadogs on the Spanish Main,'' The History Press, 2013. {{ISBN|0752496689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/englishcoloniesi00will James Alexander Williamson, ''English colonies in Guiana and on the Amazon, 1604-1668,'' Oxford, 1923; p. 54.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Roe, Thomas (DNB00)|Roe, Thomas]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Brown, ''Itinerant Ambassador: The Life of Sir Thomas Roe,''  University Press of Kentucky, 2015; p. 15. {{ISBN|0813162270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1637-38, two monks, Acana and Fritz, undertook several journeys to the lands of the Manoas, indigenous peoples living in western Guyana and what is now [[Roraima]] in northeastern Brazil. Although they found no evidence of El Dorado, their published accounts were intended to inspire further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7gVQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq= Francis Alexander Durivage, ''A popular cyclopedia of history: ancient and modern, forming a copious historical dictionary of celebrated institutions, persons, places and things ...'' Case, Tiffany and Burnham, 1847, Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1739, Nicholas Horstman, a German surgeon commissioned by the Dutch Governor of Guiana, traveled up the Essequibo River accompanied by two Dutch soldiers and four Indian guides. In April 1741 one of the Indian guides returned reporting that in 1740 Horstman had crossed over to the Rio Branco and descended it to its confluence with the Rio Negro. Horstman discovered Lake Amucu on the [[North Rupununi]] but found neither gold nor any evidence of a city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/riseofbritishguiana01stor/riseofbritishguiana01stor_djvu.txt C. A. Harris and John Abraham Jacob De Villiers, ''Storm Van's Gravesande: The Rise of British Guiana, Compiled from his Works,''  Hakluyt Society, 1911; University of Michigan.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1740, Don Manuel Centurion, Governor of [[Ciudad Bolívar|Santo Tomé de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco]] in Venezuela, hearing a report from an Indian about Lake Parima, embarked on a journey up the [[Caura River (Venezuela)|Caura River]] and the [[Paragua River]], causing the deaths of several hundred persons. His survey of the local geography, however, provided the basis for other expeditions starting in 1775.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt;

From 1775 to 1780, Nicholas Rodriguez and Antonio Santos, two entrepreneurs employed by the Spanish Governors, set out on foot and Santos, proceeding by the [[Caroní River]], the [[Paragua River]], and the [[Pacaraima Mountains]], reached the [[Uraricoera River]] and [[Branco River|Rio Branco]], but found nothing.&lt;ref name = "Pierce"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Td4MAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq= Edward M. Pierce, ''The Cottage Cyclopedia of History and Biography: A Copious Dictionary of Memorable Persons, Events, Places and Things, with Notices of the Present State of the Principal Countries and Nations of the Known World, and a Chronological View of American History,'' Case, Lockwood, 1867, Harvard University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1799 and 1804, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] conducted an extensive and scientific survey of the Guyana river basins and lakes, concluding that a seasonally-flooded confluence of rivers may be what inspired the notion of a mythical [[Lake Parime]], and of the supposed golden city on the shore, nothing was found.&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"/&gt; Further exploration by [[Charles Waterton]] (1812)&lt;ref name = "Waterton"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31811/31811-h/31811-h.htm Charles Waterton, ''Wanderings in South America,'' Cassell &amp; Co, Ltd: London, Paris &amp; Melbourne. 1891.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Schomburgk]] (1840)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cuqRdT8zlxYC&amp;pg Peter Rivière, ed. ''The Guiana Travels of Robert Schomburgk, 1835-1844: Explorations on behalf of the Royal Geographical Society, 1835-1839,'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006; p. 274.] {{ISBN|0904180867}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Humboldt's findings.

== Gold strikes and the extractive wealth of the rainforest ==
By the mid-1570s, the Spanish silver strike at [[Potosí]] in Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) was producing unprecedented real wealth.

In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I of England died, bringing to an end the era of Elizabethan adventurism.  A bit later, in 1618, Sir Walter Raleigh, the great inspirer, was beheaded for insubordination and treason.
  
In 1695, ''[[bandeirantes]]'' in the south struck gold along a tributary of the São Francisco River in the highlands of State of [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.  The prospect of real gold overshadowed the illusory promise of "gold men" and "lost cities" in the vast interior of the north.

It appears today that the Muisca obtained their gold in trade, and while they possessed large quantities of it over time, no great store of the metal was ever accumulated.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Recent research ==
{{see also|List of Muisca research institutes}}
In 1987–1988, an expedition led by [[John Hemming (explorer)|John Hemming]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society of London]] failed to uncover any evidence of the ancient city of Manoa on the [[:pt:Reserva Biológica Ilha de Maracá|island of Maracá]] in north-central Roraima. Members of the expedition were accused of looting historic artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.alertaaustral.cl/articulo.php?id=222 Rafael Videla, "El Dorado: El Gran Descubrimiento de Roland Stevenson"]&lt;/ref&gt; but an official report of the expedition described it as "an ecological survey."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/5AA89B58-6EAE-4A56-9CA4-2CE555890EB5/0/Maracabibliography.pdf John Hemming, Steve Bowles, and Fiona Watson.

=== Evidence for the existence of Lake Parime ===
{{main|Lake Parime}}
Although it was dismissed in the 19th century as a myth, some evidence for the existence of a lake in northern Brazil has been uncovered. In 1977 Brazilian geologists Gert Woeltje and Frederico Guimarães Cruz along with [[Roland Stevenson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netium.com.br/parime/Parime_English.htm Roland Stevenson, "Parime: Finding the Legendary Lake"]&lt;/ref&gt; found that on all the surrounding hillsides a horizontal line appears at a uniform level approximately {{convert|120|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}} [http://www.arqueologiamericana.com.br/artigos/artigo_01.htm Dalton Delfini Maziero, "El Dorado Em busca dos antigos mistérios Amazônicos," ''Arqueologiamericana'']&lt;/ref&gt; This line registers the water level of an extinct lake which existed until relatively recent times. Researchers who studied it found that the lake's previous diameter measured {{convert|400|km|mi}} and its area was about {{convert|80000|km2|mi2}}. About 700 years ago this giant lake began to drain due to [[tectonic movement]]. In June 1690, a massive earthquake opened a bedrock [[Fault (geology)|fault]], forming a [[rift]] or a [[graben]] that permitted the water to flow into the Rio Branco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0001-37652014000301115&amp;script=sci_arttext Alberto V.

Ciênc.,'' vol. 86 no.3 Rio de Janeiro Sept. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century it had dried up completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://explorers.org/pdf/SHEA_FLAG_REPORT_V35-C_013014.pdf Jeff Shea, ''The March 2013 Paragua River Expedition: Penetration into The Meseta de Ichún of Venezuela,'' Explorers Club Report #60]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roraima's well-known [[Pedra Pintada, Roraima|Pedra Pintada]] is the site of numerous pictographs dating to the [[pre-Columbian era]].

A. Fonseca, "A Misteriosa Pedra Pintada (Roraima)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Gold, which was reported to be washed up on the shores of the lake, was most likely carried by streams and rivers out of the mountains where it can be found today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2009/archives/03/22/significant-gold-deposits-in-roraima-basin-study/ "Significant gold deposits in Roraima Basin – study," March 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic tagging''' is a form of [[surveillance]] which uses an electronic device, fitted to the person. For example, an [[ankle monitor]] is used for people who have been sentenced to electronic monitoring by a court, or are required to wear a tag upon release from prison. It is also used in healthcare settings with people with dementia and in immigration contexts in some jurisdictions. If the device is based on [[Global Positioning System|GPS technology]], it is usually attached to a person by a probation officer, [[law enforcement]] or a private monitoring services company field officer, and is capable of tracking the wearer's location wherever there is the satellite signal to do so. Electronic monitoring tags can be also used in combination with curfews to confine defendants or offenders to their home as a condition of bail, as a stand-alone order or as a form of early release from prison. The combination of electronic monitoring with a curfew usually relies on [[radio frequency]] (RF) technology, which differs from GPS technology.

==Background==

===Conceptual history===
The use of home detention as a means of confinement and control within the home can be traced back to biblical times when the Romans placed [[Paul the Apostle]], under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbs |first1=Anita |last2=King |first2=Denise |year=2003 |title=The electronic ball and chain? The operation and impact of home detention with electronic monitoring in New Zealand |journal=[[Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1375/acri.36.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidio-modelo2.JPG|thumb|Panopticon: Presidio Modelo prison, inside one of the buildings, 2005]]
In the 18th century, the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] designed the [[Panopticon]], a hypothetical prison.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"&gt;Wood (2010){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the Panopticon (the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "all-seeing"), the prisoners are arranged in a ring of cells surrounding their guard, who is concealed in a tower in the center. The idea is that the guard controls the prisoners through his presumed observation: they constantly imagine his eyes on them, even when he's looking elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

{{Quotation|"[T]he persons to be inspected should always feel themselves as if under inspection ... for the greatest proportion of time possible, each man should actually be under inspection."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, The Panopticon Writings 41 (Miran Bozovic ed., 1995) (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bentham promoted the concept of the Panopticon for much the same reasons that spur [[criminal]]-[[justice]] innovation today{{when|date=June 2017}}—a ballooning prison population and the need for a cheap solution with light manpower demands. when the modern prison emerged,{{when|date=June 2017}} it, too, was promoted as a reform, a positive replacement for corporal or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

Early prison reformers—many of them [[Quakers]] bent on repentance and redemption— had suggested that cutting people off from the rest of the world would bring them closer to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schenwar|first1=Maya|title=The Quiet Horrors of House Arrest, Electronic Monitoring, and Other Alternative Forms of Incarceration|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "penitentiary" comes, of course, from "penitence.") Whereas the guard in Bentham's day had only two eyes, today's watcher can be virtually all-seeing, thanks to [[GPS]] monitoring technology.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

=== Development ===
In 1964, Ralph Kirkland Schwitzgebel (family name later shortened to "Gable") headed a research team at the Science Committee on Psychological Experimentation at [[Harvard]] University. The technologies of electronic monitoring have their roots in his (1968) experiments with prototype electronic monitoring devices. Schwitzgebel and William S. Hurd were granted patent #3,478,344 and published an article informing how such monitoring devices could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gable|first1=Ralph K.|last2=Gable|first2=Robert S.|title=Electronic Monitoring: Positive Intervention Strategies|journal=Federal Probation|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He developed a one-kilogram Radio Telemetry Device that could be worn by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device transmitted signals to a modified missile-tracking unit up to 400 metres away, which determined the wearer's location on a screen.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard researchers invented and assessed a prototype monitoring system to use upon juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Gable, Left to Their Own Devices: Should Manufacturers of Offender Monitoring Equipment be Liable for Design Deject?, 2009 U. ILL. J.L. TECH. &amp; POLY 333, 335&lt;/ref&gt; The public responded unfavorably on the whole, fearing that the devices were overly intrusive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Even in 1966 it was noted that, in theory, the system could be modified to gather and transmit physiological data such as pulse rates, blood alcohol levels, brain waves, or information on other bodily functions of the wearer and, conversely, that information or stimulation could be sent back to the person wearing the transmitting device. It could also be easily adapted to serve as a listening device or two-way radio. The system was tested on volunteers who included students, parolees and mental patients, and experiments along these lines exploring its possibilities were conducted. in 1969 Schwitzgebel was granted a patent in relation to the system.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1978, in diversion from its criminal justice application, a company called BI Incorporated began selling systems that allowed dairy farmers to dispense feed to their cows automatically. The company fitted a [[radio-frequency]] tag on each cow's ear so that when the cow approached the feed dispenser, a sensor in the latter caused it to drop a ration of fodder. If the same cow returned, the sensor recognized the unique signal of the tag and prevented the cow from getting a second helping until after enough time had passed for her to digest the first.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1981, writer [[Tom Stacey]] took to the British [[Home Office]] a proposal for the electronic tagging of offenders to track their movements, or fix a home curfew, using cellular radio telephone technology. Stacey had been briefly imprisoned abroad in his former role as a foreign correspondent and had for several years served as a "Prison Visitor" in England. In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on 6 October 1982 he outlined the proposal and immediate founded the ''Offender's Tag Association'', composed of electronic scientists, [[penologist]]s and prominent citizens. The term 'tagging' thus entered the British English vocabulary in the penal context.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} 
In March 1983, the ''Offender's Tag Association'' held a national press conference.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Later in 1983, a district court judge in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Jack Love, persuaded Michael Goss, a computer salesperson, to develop a system to monitor five offenders. He sentenced offenders in what is considered the first court-sanctioned use of electronic monitoring at home.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Judge Love was supposedly inspired to act based upon a storyline in a ''[[Spider-Man]]'' comic, specifically the [[The Amazing Spider-Man|newspaper comic strip version]] where the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] puts an electronic bracelet on the superhero primarily to follow his movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm QI Transcript, Season 4 Episode 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153155/http://freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm |date=12 October 2007 }} [[QI]], Transcript on qitranscripts.com; Broadcast 2006; Accessed 25 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the widespread adoption of [[cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] Internet networks in the US in the mid-1990s, electronic monitoring devices were typically home-based, dependent on a dedicated land line, and able to report only whether or not the criminal being tracked, was remaining at home. This was useful for criminals on work-release, [[parole]], or [[probation]], for example [[DWI]] offenders who were allowed to leave home to go to work during daytime hours but had to return home and remain there after a certain time of the evening.

Since the mid-1990s, more recent technology such as GPS and cellular networks have permitted courts to order more specific restrictions, such as permitting a registered child sex offender to leave his home at any time of day, but alerting authorities if they come within 100 metres of a school, park, or playground.

== How it works ==

=== Big picture ===
[[Trilateration]] is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s or [[triangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605329/trilateration Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2-Dimension trilateration ====
If someone in the [[United States]] completely lost track of where he last was, asked directions in a nearby town and a local tells that he was 625 miles from [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he could be anywhere on a circle around Boise that has a radius of 625 miles. If he then asked another person and was told that he was 690 miles from [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], he could combine this with the Boise information in two circles that intersect. He would know that he was at one of the two intersection points. If a third person told him that he was 615 miles from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], he could then eliminate the other options, because the third circle would only intersect with one of these points. The same concept works in three-dimensional space, as well, where there is only spheres instead of circles.
&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Marshall|last2=Harris|first2=Tom|title=How GPS Receivers Work|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3-Dimension trilateration ====
[[File:Navstar-2F.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artist's impression of a Navstar-2F satellite in orbit.]]

If someone knows he is 10 miles from satellite A in the sky, he could be anywhere on the surface of a huge, imaginary sphere with a 10-mile radius. If he also knows he is 15 miles from satellite B, he could overlap the first sphere with another, larger sphere. If he then also knows the distance to a third satellite, he could get a third sphere, which intersects with this circle at two points.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The Earth itself can act as a fourth sphere—only one of the two possible points will actually be on the surface of the planet, so one can eliminate the sphere in space. The GPS receiver figures both of these things out by analyzing high-frequency, low-power radio signals from the GPS satellites.

Radio waves are [[electromagnetic]] energy, which means they travel at the speed of light (about 186,000 miles per second, 300,000&amp;nbsp;km per second in a vacuum). The receiver can figure out how far the signal has traveled by timing how long it took the signal to arrive.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The correct time value will cause all of the signals that the receiver is receiving to align at a single point in space. So the receiver sets its clock to that time value, and it then has the same time value that all the atomic clocks in all of the satellites have. When you measure the distance to four located satellites, you can draw four spheres that all intersect at one point. Three spheres will intersect even if your numbers are way off, but four spheres will not intersect at one point if you've measured incorrectly. The receiver does this constantly whenever it's on, which means it is nearly as accurate as the expensive atomic clocks in the satellites.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

In order for the distance information to be of any use, the receiver also has to know where the satellites actually are. Things like the pull of the moon and the sun do change the satellites' orbits very slightly, but the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] constantly monitors their exact positions and transmits any adjustments to all GPS receivers as part of the satellites' signals.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

For one thing, this method assumes the radio signals will make their way through the atmosphere at a consistent speed, the speed of light. Problems can also occur when radio signals bounce off large objects, such as skyscrapers, giving a receiver the impression that a satellite is farther away than it actually is. The station then broadcasts a radio signal to all DGPS-equipped receivers in the area, providing signal correction information for that area.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The most essential function of a GPS receiver is to pick up the transmissions of at least four satellites and combine the information in those transmissions with information in an electronic almanac, all in order to figure out the receiver's position on Earth.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

Once the receiver makes this calculation, it can compute the latitude, longitude and altitude (or some similar measurement) of its current position.
One can use maps stored in the receiver's memory, connect the receiver to a computer, which can hold more detailed maps in its memory, or one can on a detailed map of an area find one´s way using the receiver's latitude and longitude readouts. A standard GPS receiver will not only place one´s position on a map at any particular location, but also trace one´s path across a map as one moves. If the receiver is switched on, it can stay in constant communication with GPS satellites to see how one´s location is changing.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

===Small picture===
The portable device is operatively coupled to a monitoring system through a wireless telephone network. The portable device transmits periodically encrypted location information as well as status information across the wireless network to the monitoring system. The monitoring system tracks the location of the individual and alerts the appropriate authorities when the individual violates a rule, such as a condition for parole. The portable device increases the time between transmissions when the individual is within a specified home location and reduces the time between transmissions when outside the specified location.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

As a fail-safe against any technological glitch, whether accidental or malicious, a leading Electronic Monitoring operator is immensely proud of its backup systems, which boast an ultra-secure data room and extreme redundancy: For example, if a toxic-gas cloud were to wipe out the town of Anderson, the last act of the staff there would be to flip the switches diverting all call traffic to BI's corporate office in Boulder, Colorado, where a team capable of taking over instantly in case of disaster is always on duty.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

== Other designs ==

=== Medical and health use ===
The use of electronic monitoring in medical practice, especially as it relates to the tagging of the elderly and people with [[dementia]], is capable of generating controversy, and media attention.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Electronic tagging for Alzheimer's |date=27 September 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2284537.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elderly people in care homes can be tagged with the same electronic monitors used to keep track of young offenders. For persons suffering from dementia, electronic monitoring might be beneficially used to prevent them from wandering away.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"/&gt; The controversy in its medical use relates to two arguments, one as to the safety of the patients, and the other, as to their privacy and human rights.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"&gt;Julian C Hughes and Stephen J Louw, ‘Electronic Tagging of People with Dementia who Wander: Ethical Considerations are Possibly more Important than Practical Benefits' (2002) 325(7369) British Medical Journal 847﹘848 &lt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124366/ PubMed]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At over 40%, there is a high prevalence of wandering amongst patients with dementia. Of the several methods deployed to keep them from wandering, it is reported that 44% of wanderers with dementia have been kept behind closed doors at some point.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘Getting Lost in Dementia: A Longitudinal Study of a Behavioral Symptom' (1998) 5 International Psychogeriatrics 239﹘245&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions have included constant surveillance, use of makeshift alarms and, the use of various drugs that carry the risk of adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

Opinions as to the propriety of electronic tagging of the elderly and persons with dementia vary. Carers welcome the idea of electronic tracking devices so long as it allows wanderers to be found more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘The Feasibility of Electronic Tracking Devices in Dementia: A Telephone Survey and Case Series' (1998) 13 International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 556﹘563.&lt;/ref&gt; Some persons argue that a little liberty can be sacrificed in order to achieve safety and any concern about privacy only has force when we imagine that the person involved is trying to hide.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R, Hope T and Wilkinson J, ‘Tracking Patients Who Wander: Ethics and Technology' (1994) 343 Lancet 1274.&lt;/ref&gt; The thinking behind this argument is that, for wandering persons with severe dementia, being electronically tagged and monitored carries less stigma than being found half dressed, in the middle of the night, on a highway.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt; On the other side of the argument, it is contended that even in mild dementia, the need to protect a patient's right to privacy must be maintained. Even though electronic tagging and monitoring increases liberty, in a sense, it may potentially decrease the autonomy of the patient. Tracking may only settle the anxiety of Carers and family without necessarily attending to the needs of the person with dementia. What is important is to determine if persons with dementia have the capacity to make decisions, and if they do, their decisions should be respected. Where the person lacks the capacity, decisions need to be made in their best interest. Best interest in this sense does not simply mean the person's best medical interest. Deciding on their best interest will require careful inquiry, negotiation, and judgment.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

=== Commercial use ===
On an iPhone, "Location Services" allows location-based apps and websites (including Maps, Camera, Safari, and other Apple and third-party apps) to use information from Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202588&lt;/ref&gt;

Other similar applications in the U.S. have included mobile phones enabled with GPS tracking, to allow parents to track their school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffiths|first1=Sarah|title=No more lost children!|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2618645/No-lost-children-Smart-wristband-lets-parents-track-kids-using-GPS-makes-calls.html|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vehicular use ===
Public transit vehicles are outfitted with electronic monitoring devices that talk to GPS systems tracking their locations. App developers have integrated this technology with mobile-phone apps. Now, passengers are able to receive accurate public transit timetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shakibaei|first1=Bambui|title=Real time GPS locations on transport apps|url=https://transportsydney.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/real-time-gps-locations-on-transport-apps/|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

The use of ankle bracelets, or other electronic monitoring devices, have proven to be effective in research studies and even deterred crime. As such, they benefit society. When applied early, they may save otherwise habitual offenders from a life of crime.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"&gt;Stuart S Yeh,[http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/YEH_2010.pdf ‘Cost-benefit analysis of reducing crime through electronic monitoring of parolees and probationers'] (2010) 38 Journal of Criminal Justice 1090﹘1096.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors have been identified as necessary to render electronic monitoring effective: appropriately selecting offenders, robust and appropriate technology, fitting tags promptly, responding to breaches promptly, and communication between the criminal justice system and contractors.The Quaker Council for European Affairs thinks that for electronic monitoring to be effective, it should serve to halt a developing criminal career.&lt;ref name="Quaker Council for European Affairs 2010"&gt;Quaker Council for European Affairs,[http://www.qcea.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rprt-alternatives-en-jan-2010.pdf ‘Investigating Alternatives to Imprisonment'] (2010) .&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Audit Office in England and Wales commissioned a survey to examine the experiences of electronically monitored offenders and the members of their family. The survey revealed that there was common agreement amongst survey respondents that electronic monitoring was a more effective punitive measure than fines, and that it was generally more effective than community service. An interviewed offender is credited with saying: ‘You learn more about other crimes [in prison] and I think it gives you a taste to do other crimes because you've sat listening to other people'.&lt;ref&gt;National Audit Office, [http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/0506800.pdf ‘The Electronic Monitoring of Adult Offenders: Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General'] (1 February 2006) Appendix 4, accessed 30 May 2015, .&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Padgett, Bales and Bloomberg study ===

In 2006, Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Bloomberg conducted a well–controlled, large scale evaluation of 75,661 Florida offenders placed on home detention from 1998 to 2002.,&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt; a small percentage of whom were made to wear an electronic monitoring device, which allowed comparison between those who were electronically monitored and those who were not. The study controlled for  factors thought to influence the success or failure of community supervision: the type of placement, type of electronic monitoring device (GPS or radio frequency), criminal history, offender characteristics, type of primary offence committed by each offender, court- ordered conditions of supervision, the number of weeks absconded, weeks in treatment etc. with a total of 62 variables.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Blomberg, [http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Padgett_electronic_2006.pdf ‘Under Surveillance: An Empirical Test of the Effectiveness and Consequences of Electronic Monitoring'](2006) 5(1) Criminology and Public Policy 61–91 .&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers incorporated time-varying independent variables in the estimation of maximum-likelihood coefficients, and also applied proportional-hazards survival analysis to adjust for right-censoring.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt; As of 2010, compared to other studies, no previous study of electronic monitoring controlled such an array of variables nor involved such a large sample.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt;

Regarding their rate of compliance, violent offenders monitored by GPS were 91.2% less likely to abscond than those offenders not monitored at all.  Electronic monitoring also effectively prevented offenders from committing new offences while being monitored: monitored offenders were 94.7% less likely to commit new offences than unmonitored offenders. The researchers found ‘no clear evidence that, overall, the decision to monitor offenders on home confinement with enhanced electronic control mechanisms results in ‘front-end' [[net-widening]]. In other words, offenders sentenced to home confinement with EM seem to have posed a significantly higher risk to public safety and would have had a higher likelihood of receiving a prison sentence if not for the availability of EM as an enhanced control mechanism.' In the end, GPS monitored offenders are 90.2% less likely than offenders on home confinement without EM to be revoked for a technical violation.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt;

Another major advantage is the fact that wide deployment of electronic monitoring may lead to reduced prison populations. This is most likely where monitoring is used as an alternative to prison, rather than to enhance existing non-custodial orders. Major cost savings may be achieved through building fewer prisons as well as reducing the cost of administering custodial sentences.

Another is the possibility of improving rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Electronic monitoring may allow more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families. It also avoids any negative psychological effects of incarceration, although of course the wearing of a device carries its own psychological pressures.

===GPS jamming===
In late 2009, satellite-positioning receivers for a new navigation system at [[Newark airport]] in New Jersey were suffering brief daily breaks in reception.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Matyszczyk [http://www.cnet.com/au/news/truck-driver-has-gps-jammer-accidentally-jams-newark-airport/ Truck driver has GPS jammer, accidentally jams Newark airport]  Cnet, 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=No Jam Tomorrow|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18304246|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something was interfering with the signals from orbiting global positioning system (GPS) satellites. A driver who passed by on the nearby New Jersey Turnpike each day used a cheap GPS jammer in his truck. Jammers prevent tracking devices from determining (and then reporting) its location.

Some truck companies use [[fleet management]] software integrated with GPS in vehicles to monitor whether their drivers ever break speed limits, and in response, some delivery drivers buy illegal GPS jammers to subvert the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820114756/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html |date=20 August 2014 }} Telegraph Media Group, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Collier [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/taxi-driver-fined-over-use-of-illegal-gps-jammer-in-fare-scam/story-fni0fee2-1226799269681 Taxi driver fined over use of illegal GPS jammer in fare scam] HeraldSun, Australia January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Grubb [http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/illegal-mobile-phone-and-gps-jammer-crackdown-by-regulator-yields-results-20130716-2q2oo.html Illegal mobile phone and GPS jammer crackdown by regulator yields results] July 17, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of the technology exist - some "[[Law and order (politics)|Tough on Crime]]" groups argue that electronic tagging perceived as lenient, while other groups argue that the technology enables [[Net-widening]], where non-prison bound individuals are subject to increased monitoring.

Electronic monitoring does not physically restrain a person and dangerous offenders are still able to offend before authorities can intervene. Home detention with electronic monitoring is perceived by some people as lenient.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

As early as 1988, the Penal Affairs Committee of the Religious Society of Friends ([[Quakers]]), wrote a briefing in its Green Paper strongly opposing the adoption of electronic monitoring in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|pp=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee noted all the claims made in favour of electronic monitoring but insisted that all such claims could be ‘either demolished or rendered invalid' by arguments against it. The major argument or criticism against it was that on the basis of past experience, electronic monitoring would not absolutely be used on people at risk of custody, but on people who would otherwise have been granted probation or community service. This would lead to a widening of the net of control rather than reducing prison population; it would undermine constructive and supportive interventions. The Penal Committee concluded that the degrading monitoring of fellow human beings, electronically, was morally wrong and unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the system was inherently ‘retributive and punitive' and the wearing of an ankle monitor would be stigmatizing for women offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Nellis, ‘Quakers, Penal Reform and the Challenge of Electronically Monitoring Offenders' (2011) 25 (1–2) International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 95﹘105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US in 1990, Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx criticised the use of electronic monitoring in a paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Society of Criminology]], [[Baltimore]]. In the paper, which was later published in the Justice Quarterly, the authors described ‘the new surveillance' technology as sharing some ethos and the information-gathering techniques found in maximum-security prisons thereby allowing them to diffuse into the broader society. They remarked that ‘we appear to be moving toward, rather than away from, becoming a "maximum-security society."'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"&gt;Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx, ‘Critique: No Soul In The New Machine: Technofallacies In The Electronic Monitoring Movement' (1991) 8 (3) Justice Quarterly [http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/critique.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledged the data-mining capacity of electronic monitoring devices when they stated that ‘data in many different forms, from widely separated geographical areas, organizations, and time periods, can easily be merged and analyzed.'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"/&gt;

In 2013, it was reported that many electronic-monitoring programs throughout the US were not staffed appropriately.&lt;ref name="Osher"&gt;Christopher N Osher, ‘Electronic Monitoring of Colorado Parolees has Pitfalls', [[The Denver Post]] (Online), 6 September 2013 [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls &lt;http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; George Drake, a consultant who worked on improving the systems said ‘Many times when an agency is budgeted for electronic-monitoring equipment, it is only budgeted for the devices themselves.' He added that the situation was ‘like buying a hammer and expecting a house to be built. It's simply a tool, and it requires a professional to use that tool and run the program.' Drake warned that programs can get out of control if officials don't develop stringent protocols for how to respond to alerts and don't manage how alerts are generated: ‘I see agencies with so many alerts that they can't deal with them,' Drake said. ‘They end up just throwing their hands up and saying they can't keep up with them.' In [[Colorado]], a review of alert and event data, obtained from the Colorado Department of Corrections under an open-records request, was conducted by matching the names of parolees who appeared in that data with those who appeared in jail arrest records. The data revealed that 212 parole officers were saddled with the duty of responding to nearly 90,000 alerts and notification generated by electronic monitoring devices in the six months reviewed.&lt;ref name="Osher"/&gt;

According to an analysis in the Journal of Law and Policy, most of those placed on electronic monitors haven't committed serious or violent offenses and, were it not for monitoring, "at least some of these populations would not in fact be incarcerated or otherwise under physical control." Eighty-nine percent of probation officers surveyed by the Justice Department felt that "offenders' relationships with their significant others changed because of being monitored." Both officers and those monitored observed that the ankle band had a distinct impact on children. As one parent testified, "When it beeps, the kids worry about whether the probation officer is coming to take me to jail. The kids run for it when it beeps."

== Movies, literature and the arts ==

As a condition for her bail, Gabrielle Baillieux, the protagonist in Peter Carey's ''Amnesia'', had to wear an ankle monitor. Later a colleague took it off. The device was transferred to a dog, whose movements were instead tracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Peter|title=Amnesia|date=2015|publisher=Random House Canada|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Good Wife]]'', ("Bang") season 1 episode 15, Peter had been imprisoned for several months after being convicted of charges of corruption. He is allowed to return home under house arrest while his appeal is considered. Peter must wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the apartment or communicate with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bang (The Good Wife)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007 American mystery horror-thriller movie, [[Disturbia (film)|''Disturbia'']], a 17-year-old high school student, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf), is charged with aggravated assault after his teacher made a personal remark about his dad, who had died in a car accident, and Kale is sentenced to three months of house arrest. He is secured with an ankle monitor and allowed only 100 feet from his house.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Jurisdictions ==

=== USA ===

The U.S. correctional system is overwhelmed by the over-incarceration of nonviolent offenders such as drug users. Private-prison corporations themselves have begun to expand into the "alternatives" industry. The GEO Group now has an array of "community reëntry services" and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stillman|first1=Sarah|title=Get Out of Jail Inc.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/get-out-of-jail-inc|accessdate=Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it acquired the country's largest electronic-monitoring firm, BI Incorporated, for $415 million.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; For the most part, these companies deal not with felony probationers ("probation" as it is usually understood) but with people whose offenses are often too minor to merit jail time. The system is known as "offender-funded" justice.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

Jack Long, a Georgia attorney, filed a habeas petition on behalf of a client who, after stealing a two-dollar can of beer from a convenience store, was ordered to spend a year wearing an ankle bracelet operated by a company called [[Sentinel Offender Services]].&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; The man wound up owing more than a thousand dollars to the company in fees and late-payment penalties, and started selling his blood plasma to keep pace. Dozens of probationers are jailed because of electronic-monitoring bills, most of which were not authorized by any legal statute.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

Electronic monitoring of a curfew has become an integral part of the criminal justice system in the [[United Kingdom]], used at various stages of criminal cases used to monitor compliance with a curfew, requiring the curfewee to remain in their home for a specified number of hours a day or exclusion from specified areas (such as victim's homes and football grounds).

Those subject to electronic monitoring may be given curfews as part of [[Bail]] conditions, sentenced under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] in England and Wales (with separate legislation applying in Scotland). Alternatively offenders may be released from a prison on a [[Home Detention Curfew]]. Released prisoners under home detention allowed out during curfew hours only for:
#A wedding or funeral (service only) of a close relative
#A job interview
#Acting as a witness in court
#Emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offendersfamilieshelpline.org/index.php/hdc/ Home Detention Curfew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, electronic monitoring may be used for those subject to a curfew given under the [[Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011]] (previously known as [[Control order]] under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24803069&lt;/ref&gt;)

Since electronically monitored curfews were rolled out throughout England and Wales their use has increased sharply, from 9,000 cases in 1999-2000 to 53,000 in 2004-05. In 2004-05, the Home Office spent £102.3 million on the electronic monitoring of curfews and electronically monitored curfews are considered cheaper than custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-electronic-monitoring-of-adult-offenders/&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety days in [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]] (e.g., a prison) costs approximately five times more than the same amount of time on an electronically monitored curfew order.

Typically, offenders are fitted with an electronic tag around their ankle which sends a regular signal to a receiver unit installed in their home. Some systems are connected to a [[landline|fixed telephone line]] in the case where a [[GSM|GSM signal]] is not available, whilst most arrangements utilise the mobile phone system to communicate with the monitoring company. If the tag is not functioning or within range of the base station during curfew hours, or if the base is disconnected from the power supply, or the base station is moved then the monitoring company are alerted, who in turn, notify the appropriate authority such as the [[Police|Law enforcement in the United Kingdom]], [[National Probation Service]] or [[Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/criminology/msc/unit8/page_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Policy Exchange thinktank examined the use of electronic monitoring in England and Wales and made comparisons with technologies and models seen in other jurisdictions, particularly the United States. The report was critical of the Ministry of Justice's model of a fully privatised service - which gave little scope for police or probation services to make use of electronic monitoring. The report, Future of Corrections, also criticised the cost of the service, highlighting an apparent differential between what the UK taxpayer was charged and what could be found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Corrections-Exploring-Electronic-Monitoring/dp/1907689273|title=Future of Corrections: Exploring the Use of Electronic Monitoring|last=Geoghegan|first=Rory|last2=Miller|first2=Chris|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Policy Exchange|isbn=9781907689277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of publication the Ministry of Justice was completing a procurement exercise for a new generation of GPS tags - and the report described the exercise as flawed, calling on electronic monitoring to be commissioned locally via Police and Crime Commissioners.

Subsequently, there were a number of scandals in relation to electronic monitoring in England and Wales, with a criminal investigation opened by the Serious Fraud Office into the activities of Serco and G4S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2013/11/04/g4s-serco-investigation-2/|title=G4S and Serco investigation|date=2013-11-04|website=Serious Fraud Office|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, Serco agreed to repay £68.5 million to the taxpayer and G4S agreed to repay £109 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2015/06/25/moj-paid-g4s-serco-millions-for-electronic-tagging-during-fr|title=MoJ paid G4S &amp; Serco millions for electronic tagging during fraud investigation|last=Dunt|first=Ian|newspaper=politics.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duopoly were subsequently stripped of their contract, with Capita taking over the contract. In 2017, another criminal investigation saw police make a number of arrests in relation to allegations that at least 32 criminals on tag had paid up to £400 to Capita employees in order to have 'loose' tags fitted, allowing them to remove their tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/arrests-after-criminals-paid-163400-to-get-loose-electronic-tags-10755416|title=Criminals 'paid £400' for loose electronic tags|newspaper=Sky News|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monitoring of sex offenders via electronic tagging is currently in debate due to certain rights offenders have in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/aug/12/larry-murphy-electronic-tagging Electronic tagging of offenders raises rights concerns], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic tagging has begun being used on psychiatric patients, prompting concern from mental health advocates who state that the practice is demeaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackmentalhealth.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=789&amp;Itemid=117 GPS tracking mental health patients - human rights concerns], BMH UK, 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], those convicted of a serious sexual or violent crime, and are determined to pose a serious danger to the community, are to be given a sentence, known as an [[Order for Lifelong Restriction]], which means that the offender will be detained indefinitely, until the [[Parole Board for Scotland]] determines that the offender no longer poses a risk to the safety of others. If the offender is released on [[parole]], he or she is to be electronically tagged and kept under close supervision by the Scottish Parole Board for the remainder of the offender's life.

=== Australia ===

==== Pre-trial ====
In [[Western Australia]], The Bail Act 1982 (WA) specifically provides for electronic monitoring at the pre-trial stage. The Act allows only judicial officers to impose a home detention. This is done after first obtaining a suitability report, from a corrections officer, on accused persons aged over 17. The accused person may then be required to wear a device or permit the installation of a device in the place where he/she is required to remain.

In most Australian jurisdictions, the generally broad discretion available when imposing bail conditions may permit electronic monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Nacro Youth Crime 2002, "Electronic monitoring of children remanded on bail or to local authority accommodation", Youth Crime Briefing, June&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in section 11(2) of the South Australian Bail Act 1985, the bail authority may 'impose a condition requiring an accused person to remain at his or her residence except for authorised activities such as employment.'&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; The Supreme Court of South Australia, it is thought,&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; may have interpreted this as authority to order electronically monitored bail, at least where the applicant is willing.&lt;ref&gt;R v Blayney [2002] SASC 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primary sentencing ====
The [[Northern Territory]] and Western Australia have laws that specifically authorize electronic monitoring as a primary sentencing option for home detention. The ''Sentencing Act 1995'', of the Northern Territory, provides that a 'court which sentences an offender to a term of imprisonment may make an order suspending the sentence on the offender entering into a home detention order'. Such offenders may be required to 'wear or have attached an approved monitoring device in accordance with the directions of the Commissioner, and allow the placing, or installation in, and retrieval from, the premises or place specified in the order of such machine, equipment or device necessary for the efficient operation of the monitoring device'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 44 (3) (b), ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (NT).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Australia, the ''Sentencing Act 1995'' provides that a court may impose an intensive supervision order with a curfew requirement. The offender is required to submit to surveillance or monitoring as ordered;&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (1) (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; wear a device or have a device installed in his or her home.&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (10) (a) &amp; (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic monitoring 'may only be imposed for a term of six months or less'.

In [[New South Wales]], although the law does not specifically authorise electronic monitoring, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), however, grants the court the power to 'impose such conditions as it considers appropriate on any home detention order made by it'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 82 (1), ''Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, electronic monitoring is used to enforce these home detention orders.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, N. 2000, "Home detention: An alternative to prison?" Current Issues in Criminal Justice, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt; The general powers of court may also allow electronic monitoring in other States and Territories.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

=== Brazil ===
In August 2010, Brazil awarded a GPS Offender Monitoring contract to kick start its monitoring of offenders and management of the Brazilian governments early release programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://latinamerica.tmcnet.com/topics/brazil/articles/96256-securealert-signs-first-ever-gps-offender-monitoring-contract.htm SecureAlert Signs First-Ever GPS Offender Monitoring Contract in Brazil], TMCnet, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Electronic monitoring as a pilot project was started in March 2012, involving 150 offenders, mostly prisoners serving life terms. The project was rolled out to reduce the South Africa's prison population. It consequently would also reduce the taxpayer's burden on correctional facilities.&lt;ref name="DCS"&gt;Dept. of Correctional services: Rep of South Africa, South Africa's first ever Electronic of a Remand Detainee, 15/04/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa locks up more people than any other country on the continent.&lt;ref name="DCS"/&gt;

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

{{United States constitutional law}}

'''Executive privilege''' is the power of the [[President of the United States]] and other members of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[United States Government]] to resist certain [[subpoena]]s and other interventions by the [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial branch]]es of government in pursuit of information or personnel relating to the executive. The power of [[United States Congress|Congress]] or the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] to obtain such information is not mentioned explicitly in the [[United States Constitution]], nor is there any explicit mention in the Constitution of an executive privilege to resist such requests from Congress or courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald Cox|Cox, Archibald]].  [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol122/iss6/1 "Executive Privilege"], ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', Volume 122, page 1384 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has ruled this privilege may qualify as an element of the [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] doctrine, derived from the supremacy of the executive branch in its own area of Constitutional activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority in ''US v. Nixon'' noted: "Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 ''United States v. Nixon''], 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (Supreme Court opinion at FindLaw)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary, instead of emanating from Congress.&lt;ref name=USvNixon&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 ''United States v. Nixon''], 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (Supreme Court opinion at FindLaw)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a "sufficient showing" that the "Presidential material" is "essential to the justice of the case". [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger|Warren Burger]] further stated that executive privilege would most effectively apply when the oversight of the executive would impair that branch's national security concerns.&lt;ref name=USvNixon /&gt;  Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the [[Congressional Research Service]],&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;Garvey, Todd.  [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/R42670.pdf Presidential Claims of Executive Privilege: History, Law, Practice, and Recent Developments], [[Congressional Research Service]], p. 1 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; only two federal court cases had addressed the merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those cases reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://openjurist.org/498/f2d/725/senate-select-committee-on-presidential-campaign-activities-v-m-nixon Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon]'', 498 F.2d 725 (D.C. Cir. 1974); ''[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1810993/committee-on-jud-us-house-of-repres-v-miers/ Comm. on the Judiciary v. Miers]'', 558 F. Supp. 2d 53 (D.D.C. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to which branch of government is requesting the information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether it involves a "presidential communications privilege" or instead a "[[deliberative process privilege]]" or some other type of privilege.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt; The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in [[common law]], whereas the presidential communications privilege is often considered to be rooted in separation of powers, thus making the deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Narayan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4406&amp;context=flr|title=Proper Assertion of the Deliberative Process Principle|author=Narayan, S.| page= 6|website=fordham.edu|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual deference in view of previous practice and precedents regarding the exercise of executive privilege.

==Early precedents==
[[Deliberative process privilege]] is a specific instance of the more general principle of executive privilege.  It is usually considered to be based upon common law rather than separation of powers, and its history traces back to the English crown privilege (now known as [[public-interest immunity]]).&lt;ref name=Narayan /&gt;  In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is another specific instance of executive privilege, usually considered as being based upon separation of powers, and for that reason it is more difficult to overcome than deliberative process privilege.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;  A significant requirement of the presidential communications privilege is that it can only protect communications sent or received by the President or his immediate advisors, whereas the deliberative process privilege may extend further down the chain of command.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;

In the context of privilege assertions by United States presidents, law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] has written: "In 1796, President [[George Washington]] refused to comply with a request by the House of Representatives for documents related to the negotiation of the then-recently adopted [[Jay Treaty]] with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The Senate alone plays a role in the ratification of treaties, Washington reasoned, and therefore the House had no legitimate claim to the material. Therefore, Washington provided the documents to the Senate but not the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20020206.html|title=A Brief History Of Executive Privilege, From George Washington Through Dick Cheney|author=Dorf, Michael |date=February 6, 2002 |website=Findlaw|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] continued the precedent for this in the trial of [[Aaron Burr]] for [[treason]] in 1809. Burr asked the court to issue a ''[[subpoena duces tecum]]'' to compel Jefferson to testify or provide his private letters concerning Burr. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], a strong proponent of the powers of the federal government but also a political opponent of Jefferson, ruled that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] to the Constitution, which allows for these sorts of court orders for criminal defendants, did not provide any exception for the president. As for Jefferson's claim that disclosure of the document would imperil public safety, Marshall held that the court, not the president, would be the judge of that. Jefferson refused to personally testify but provided selected letters.

In 1833, President [[Andrew Jackson]] cited executive privilege when Senator [[Henry Clay]] demanded he produce documents concerning statements the president made to his cabinet about the removal of federal deposits from the [[Second Bank of the United States]] during the [[Bank War]].&lt;ref&gt;David and Jeanne Heidler, ''Henry Clay: The Essential American'' (2010) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War era==
During the period of 1947–49, several major security cases became known to Congress. There followed a series of investigations, culminating in the famous [[Alger Hiss|Hiss]]-[[Whittaker Chambers|Chambers]] case of 1948. At that point, the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration issued a sweeping secrecy order blocking congressional efforts from FBI and other executive data on security problems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Security files were moved to the White House and Administration officials were banned from testifying before Congress on security related matters. Investigation of the State Department and other cases was stymied and the matter left unresolved.

During the [[Army–McCarthy hearings]] in 1954, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] used the claim of executive privilege to forbid the "provision of any data about internal conversations, meetings, or written communication among staffers, with no exception to topics or people." Department of Defense employees were also instructed not to testify on any such conversations or produce any such documents or reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Blacklisted by History p. 575&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to refuse the McCarthy Committee subpoenas of transcripts of monitored telephone calls from Army officials, as well as information on meetings between Eisenhower officials relating to the hearings. This was done in the form of a letter from Eisenhower to the Department of Defense and an accompanying memo from Eisenhower Justice. The reasoning behind the order was that there was a need for "candid" exchanges among executive employees in giving "advice" to one another. In the end, Eisenhower would invoke the claim 44 times between 1955 and 1960.

==''United States v. Nixon''==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
The Supreme Court addressed "executive privilege" in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the 1974 case involving the demand by [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] [[special prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]] that President [[Richard Nixon]] produce the audiotapes of conversations he and his colleagues had in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] in connection with criminal charges being brought against members of the Nixon Administration. Nixon invoked the privilege and refused to produce any records.

The Supreme Court did not reject the claim of privilege out of hand; it noted, in fact, "the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties" and that "[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process." This is very similar to the logic that the Court had used in establishing an "executive immunity" defense for high office-holders charged with violating citizens' constitutional rights in the course of performing their duties. The Supreme Court stated: "To read the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of 'a workable government' and gravely impair the role of the courts under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]]." Because Nixon had asserted only a generalized need for confidentiality, the Court held that the larger public interest in obtaining the truth in the context of a criminal prosecution took precedence.

"Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced into the difficult task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and the Executive's Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive's claims of confidentiality and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers and checks and balances. These 'occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two branches' are likely to be avoided whenever possible. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=683 United States v. Nixon], supra, at 692."&lt;ref&gt;Holding, Reynolds. ''Time'', March 21, 2007. {{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1601450,00.html|title=The Executive Privilege Showdown|accessdate=2007-03-27 | work=Time | date=March 21, 2007 | first=Reynolds | last=Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Watergate era==
===Reagan administration===
In November 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a directive regarding congressional requests for information. Reagan wrote that if Congress seeks information potentially subject to executive privilege, then executive branch officials should "request the congressional body to hold its request in abeyance" until the president decides whether to invoke the privilege.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;Savage, Charlie.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/us/politics/executive-privilege-sessions-trump.html  "Explaining Executive Privilege and Sessions’s Refusal to Answer Questions"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===George H. W. Bush administration===
Prior to becoming Attorney General in 1991, [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William P. Barr]] issued guidance in 1989 about responding to congressional requests for confidential executive branch information. He wrote: "Only when the accommodation process fails to resolve a dispute and a subpoena is issued does it become necessary for the president to consider asserting executive privilege".&lt;ref&gt;Barr, William.  [https://www.justice.gov/file/24236/download "Congressional Requests for Confidential Executive Branch Information"], U.S. Department of Justice (June 19, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savage /&gt;

===Clinton administration===
The Clinton administration invoked executive privilege on fourteen occasions.

In 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] became the first president since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court, when a federal judge ruled that Clinton aides could be called to testify in the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Peter; and Schmidt, Susan. {{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/starr050698.htm|accessdate=2007-03-27|title=President is Denied Executive Privilege | work=The Washington Post | date=July 22, 1998}} ''The Washington Post'', May 6, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Clinton exercised a form of negotiated executive privilege when he agreed to testify before the grand jury called by [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] only after negotiating the terms under which he would appear. Declaring that "absolutely no one is above the law", Starr said such a privilege "must give way" and evidence "must be turned over" to prosecutors if it is relevant to an investigation.

===George W. Bush administration===
The Bush administration invoked executive privilege on six occasions.

President [[George W. Bush]] first asserted executive privilege in December 2001 to deny disclosure of details regarding former Attorney General [[Janet Reno]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29bush.html|title=Bush Asserts Executive Privilege on Subpoenas|first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|date=June 29, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=June 3, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal involving [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) misuse of organized crime informants [[James J. Bulger]] and [[Stephen Flemmi]], and Justice Department deliberations about President Bill Clinton's fundraising tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A16FC3B5B0C778DDDAB0994D9404482 |title=Bush Claims Executive Privilege in Response to House Inquiry |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |work=The New York Times|date=2001-12-14 |accessdate=2007-07-17 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush invoked executive privilege "in substance" in refusing to disclose the details of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]'s meetings with energy executives, which was not appealed by the GAO. In a separate Supreme Court decision in 2004, however, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] noted "Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power 'not to be lightly invoked.'" ''[[United States v. Reynolds]]'', 345 U.S. 1, 7 (1953).

Further, on June 28, 2007, Bush invoked executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas requesting documents from former presidential counsel [[Harriet Miers]] and former political director [[Sara Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19480518|title=White House refuses to answer subpoenas|date=June 28, 2007|website=msn.com|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reason for these distinctions rests upon a bedrock presidential prerogative: for the President to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice and that free and open discussions and deliberations occur among his advisors and between those advisors and others within and outside the Executive Branch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 9, 2007, Bush again invoked executive privilege to block a congressional subpoena requiring the testimonies of Taylor and Miers. Furthermore, [[White House Counsel]] [[Fred F. Fielding]] refused to comply with a deadline set by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain its privilege claim, prove that the president personally invoked it, and provide logs of which documents were being withheld. On July 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite Miers and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Joshua Bolten]] for [[contempt of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House inches toward constitutional showdown with contempt vote |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/25/house.contempt/index.html |work=Politics |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = House Judiciary Reports Contempt Citations to the House of Representatives |publisher = [[U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary]] |date = July 25, 2007 |url = http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=837 |accessdate = 2007-07-26 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070725214703/http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=837 |archivedate = July 25, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, less than a week after claiming executive privilege for Miers and Taylor, Fielding effectively claimed the privilege again, this time in relation to documents related to the 2004 death of [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Ranger]] [[Pat Tillman]]. In a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Fielding claimed certain papers relating to discussion of the [[friendly fire]] shooting "implicate Executive Branch confidentiality interests" and would therefore not be turned over to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House Rebuffs Congress on Tillman Papers |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003788310_webtillman13.html |work=Politics |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510231247/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003788310_webtillman13.html |archivedate=May 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2007, Bush invoked the privilege for the fourth time in little over a month, this time rejecting a subpoena for [[Karl Rove]]. The subpoena would have required Rove to testify before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] in a probe over fired federal prosecutors. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]], Fielding claimed that "Rove, as an immediate presidential advisor, is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure and that relate to his official duties in that capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush won't let aide Rove testify to Congress|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0141867220070801 |work=Politics |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leahy claimed that President Bush was not involved with the decision to terminate the service of U.S. attorneys. Furthermore, he asserted that the president's executive privilege claims protecting both Bolten and Rove were illegal. The Senator demanded that Bolten, Rove, Sara Taylor, and [[J. Scott Jennings]] comply "immediately" with their subpoenas. This development paved the way for a Senate panel vote on whether to advance the citations to the full Senate. "It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover-up and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that same effort", Leahy concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leahy: Bush not involved in firings |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071130/ap_on_go_co/senate_prosecutors_17 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

{{as of|2008|July|17}}, Rove still claimed executive privilege to avoid a congressional subpoena. Rove's lawyer wrote that his client is "constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rove ignores committee's subpoena, refuses to testify|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/10/rove.subpoena/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-07-10 | date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama administration===
On June 20, 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] asserted executive privilege in order to withhold certain [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] documents related to the [[Operation Fast and Furious]] controversy ahead of a [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] vote to hold Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in [[contempt of Congress]] for refusing to produce the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|title=Obama team: 'Fast and Furious' documents are privileged|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/06/obama-team-fast-and-furious-documents-are-privileged/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savage | first=Charlie | title=House Recommends Contempt for Holder | website=The New York Times | date=June 8, 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/us/obama-claims-executive-privilege-in-gun-case.html | access-date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, the House Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to hold Holder in contempt of Congress over not releasing the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madhani and Davis|first=Aamer and Susan|title=House panel votes to cite Holder for contempt of Congress|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-06-20/holder-contempt-House-vote/55717644/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive privilege was also used in a lawsuit stemming from the 2012 implementation of the "Net Worth Sweep" against [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]. The Obama administration did not disclose roughly 11,000 documents from the plaintiffs in the discovery process as they related to the reasoning behind the 2012 actions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====House investigation of the SEC====
Leaders of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) testified on February 4, 2009 before the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] subcommittee.

===Trump administration===
While investigating [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] subpoenaed former FBI Director [[James Comey]] to testify. Comey was [[Dismissal of James Comey|fired]] several weeks before being subpoenaed but had appeared before the committee once before in March while still serving as director. Less than a week before the scheduled hearing, it was reported that [[President Trump]] was considering invoking executive privilege to prevent Comey's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/politics/trump-james-comey-executive-privilege/index.html%3E|title=Error|website=CNN|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-02/trump-reviewing-whether-to-block-comey-testimony-spokesman-says|title=Trump Reviewing Whether to Block Comey Testimony to Senate|date=June 2, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 3, 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to attorney Page Pate, it seemed unlikely that executive privilege would be applicable, as Trump had publicly spoken about the encounters in question multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pate|first1=Page|title=Trump can't stop Comey with executive privilege|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/03/opinions/trump-cant-stop-comey-testimony-pate/index.html|accessdate=June 3, 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]], a White House spokesman, released a statement on June 5 stating: "The president's power to assert executive privilege is very well-established. However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey's scheduled testimony."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/05/comey-trump-239146|title=White House: Trump will not assert executive privilege to block Comey's testimony|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 2017, other officials in the Trump administration, including [[Dan Coats]] and [[Jeff Sessions]], declined to describe in congressional hearings conversations they had with President Trump, on the ground that they wanted Trump to have an opportunity to decide whether to invoke executive privilege.  According to [[Robert S. Litt]], former general counsel of the [[Director of National Intelligence|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] in the Obama administration, this argument may be legitimate under the presidential communications privilege:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he privilege belongs to the President, and inferior officers should not take it upon themselves to disclose such communications without express permission from the White House. Certainly that is how these issues were handled in the Obama Administration: when Congress asked an agency for information about presidential communications, as it often did, the agency consulted with the White House to see if there were objections to responding.&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Robert.  [https://www.lawfareblog.com/some-thoughts-coats-rogers-testimony-and-executive-privilege "Some Thoughts on the Coats-Rogers Testimony and Executive Privilege"], [[Lawfare (blog)]] (June 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Paul.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-08/why-trump-s-intel-chiefs-can-stonewall-congress "Why Trump’s Intel Chiefs Can Stonewall Congress"], [[Bloomberg News]] (June 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democratic members of Congress emphasized that they were not seeking classified information, and strongly objected to the rationale given by the Trump administration officials.&lt;ref&gt;Zapotosky, Matt.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jeff-sessions-finds-a-shield-in-executive-privilege--but-it-might-not-be-a-strong-one/2017/06/13/977677ce-5077-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html "Jeff Sessions finds a shield in executive privilege — but it might not be a strong one"], [[The Washington Post]] (June 13, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2018, [[Steve Bannon]], the former Trump political adviser, but who was no longer part of the Trump administration, appeared at the [[House Intelligence Committee]] under subpoena. According to committee members, he answered only 25 questions that had been pre-approved by the White House, in each to which he answered "no", and invoked the president's executive privilege in declining to answer any of the committee questions. Republican and Democratic members of the committee said they were considering seeking [[contempt of Congress]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/steve-bannon-scripted-questions-russia-probe-414755|title=Bannon limits answers to House after seeing Mueller|work=Politico|date=2018-02-15|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4230">In [[metaphysics]], '''extension''' signifies both 'stretching out' (Latin: ''extensio'') as well as later 'taking up space', and most recently, spreading one's internal mental cognition into the external world.

The history of thinking about ''extension'' can be traced back at least to Archytas' spear analogy for the infinity of space. How far can one's hand or spear stretch out until it reaches the edge of reality? “If I arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the nature of space] not to be able to extend it.”

[[René Descartes]] defined extension as the property of existing in more than one dimension, a property that was later followed up in Grassmann's n-dimensional algebra. For Descartes, the primary characteristic of [[matter]] is extension (''res extensa''), just as the primary characteristic of [[mind]] is [[thought]] (''res cogitans'').

This can be contrasted with {{According to whom|current conceptions in quantum physics|date=January 2014}}, where the [[Planck length]], an almost unimaginably tiny quantity, represents reaching that distance scale where, it has been theorized, all measurement seemingly breaks down to that which can be subsumed at this scale, as distance only, or extension.

[[John Locke]], in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', defined extension as "only the Space that lies between the Extremities of those solid coherent Parts" of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Volume 1 |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |year=1816 |publisher=B. Smith|page= 131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9sUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22only+the+space+that+lies+between+the+extremities+of+the+solid+coherent+parts%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the space possessed by a body. Locke refers to the extension in conjunction with ''[[solidity]]'' and ''[[impenetrability]],'' the other primary characteristics of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Volume 1 |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |year=1816 |publisher=B. Smith|pages= 131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9sUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22only+the+space+that+lies+between+the+extremities+of+the+solid+coherent+parts%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extension also plays an important part in the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]], who says that substance (that which has extension) can be limited only by substance of the same sort, i.e. matter cannot be limited by ideas and vice versa. From this principle, he determines that substance is infinite. This infinite substance is what Spinoza calls [[God]], or better yet [[nature]], and it possesses both unlimited extension and unlimited consciousness.

==Infinite divisibility==
''Infinite divisibility'' refers to the idea that extension, or quantity, when divided and further divided infinitely, cannot reach the point of zero quantity. It can be divided into very small or negligible quantity but not zero or no quantity at all.  Using a mathematical approach, specifically geometric models, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and Descartes discussed the infinite divisibility of extension. Actual divisibility may be limited due to unavailability of cutting instruments, but its possibility of breaking into smaller pieces is infinite.

==Compenetration==
''Compenetration'' refers to two or more extensions occupying the same space at the same time. This, according to [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers, is impossible; according to this view, only spirits or spiritualized matter can occupy a place occupied already by an entity (matter or spirit)

==Extended Mind Thesis==
In more recent work, philosophers David Chalmers and Andy Clark in 1998 published "[[The Extended Mind]]." This has opened a wide channel of new research at the nexus of epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive and neuro-science, dynamic systems thinking, science, technology &amp; innovation studies.

In [[geophysics]], a '''geopotential model''' is the theoretical analysis of measuring and calculating the effects of [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]].

==Newton's law==

[[Image:NewtonsLawOfUniversalGravitation.svg|150px|right|thumb|Diagram of two masses attracting one another]]

[[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] states that the gravitational force ''F'' acting between two [[point mass]]es ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with [[centre of mass]] separation ''r'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = - G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and '''r̂''' is the radial [[unit vector]]. For an object of continuous mass distribution, each mass element ''dm'' can be treated as a point mass, so the [[volume integral]] over the extent of the object gives:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\bar{F}} = - G \int\limits_V \frac{\rho }{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\,dx\,dy\,dz
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

with corresponding [[gravitational potential]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
u\ =\ -\int\limits_V \rho \frac{G}{r}\, dx\,dy\,dz
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where ρ = ρ(''x, y, z'') is the [[mass density]] at the [[volume element]] and of the direction from the volume element to the point mass.

===The case of a homogeneous sphere===

In the special case of a sphere with a spherically symmetric mass density then ρ = ρ(''s''), i.e. density depends only on the radial distance

:&lt;math&gt;s = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

These integrals can be evaluated analytically. This is the [[shell theorem]] saying that in this case:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\bar{F} = -\frac{GM}{R^2}\ \hat{r}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

with corresponding [[potential]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
u = -\frac{GM}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

where ''M'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;ρ(''s'')''dxdydz'' is the total mass of the sphere.

==The deviations of Earth's gravitational field from that of a homogeneous sphere==

In reality, Earth is not exactly spherical, mainly because of its rotation around the polar axis that makes its shape slightly oblate. If this shape were perfectly known together with the exact mass density ρ = ρ(''x, y, z''), the integrals ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) could be evaluated with numerical methods to find a more accurate model for Earth's gravitational field. However, the situation is in fact the opposite. By observing the orbits of spacecraft and the Moon, Earth's gravitational field can be determined quite accurately and the best estimate of Earth's mass is obtained by dividing the product ''GM'' as determined from the analysis of spacecraft orbit with a value for ''G'' determined to a lower relative accuracy using other physical methods.

From the defining equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) it is clear (taking the partial derivatives of the integrand) that outside the body in empty space the following differential equations are valid for the field caused by the body:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial F_x }{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y }{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_z }{\partial z} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\phi\ =\ R(r)\ \Theta(\theta)\ \Phi(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) are the [[spherical coordinates]] which satisfy the partial differential equation ({{EquationNote|6}}) (the [[Laplace's equation|Laplace equation]]) are called [[spherical harmonic function|spherical harmonic functions]].

They take the forms:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(x,y,z) &amp; =\frac{1}{r^{n+1}} P^m_n(\sin \theta) \cos m\varphi \,,&amp;\quad 0 \le m \le n \,,&amp;\quad n=0,1,2,\dots \\
h(x,y,z) &amp; =\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}  P^m_n(\sin \theta) \sin m\varphi \,,&amp;\quad 1 \le m \le n \,,&amp;\quad n=1,2,\dots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where [[spherical coordinates]] (''r'', θ, φ) are used, given here in terms of cartesian (''x, y, z'') for reference:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;x = r \cos \theta \cos \varphi \\
&amp;y = r \cos \theta \sin \varphi \\
&amp;z = r \sin \theta\,,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

also ''P''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Legendre polynomials]] and ''P&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for 1 ≤ ''m'' ≤ ''n'' are the [[Associated Legendre polynomials|associated Legendre functions]].

The first spherical harmonics with ''n'' = 0,1,2,3 are presented in the table below.

The model for Earth's gravitational potential is a sum

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
u = -\frac{\mu }{r} + \sum_{n=2}^{N_z}  \frac{J_n P^0_n(\sin\theta) }{r^{n+1}} + \sum_{n=2}^{N_t} \sum_{m=1}^n \frac{ P^m_n(\sin\theta) (C_n^m \cos m\varphi + S_n^m \sin m\varphi)}{r^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\mu=GM&lt;/math&gt; and the coordinates ({{EquationNote|8}}) are relative the standard geodetic reference system extended into space with origin in the center of the [[reference ellipsoid]] and with ''z''-axis in the direction of the polar axis.

The '''zonal terms''' refer to terms of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P^0_n(\sin\theta) }{r^{n+1}} \quad n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''tesseral terms''' terms refer to terms of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ P^m_n(\sin\theta) \cos m\varphi}{r^{n+1}}\,, \quad 1 \le m \le n \quad n=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ P^m_n(\sin\theta) \sin m\varphi}{r^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

The zonal and tesseral terms for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 are left out in ({{EquationNote|9}}).

The different coefficients ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', are then given the values for which the best possible agreement between the computed and the observed spacecraft orbits is obtained.

As ''P''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = −''P''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(−''x'') non-zero coefficients ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for '''odd ''n''''' correspond to a lack of symmetry "north–south" relative the equatorial plane for the mass distribution of Earth. Non-zero coefficients ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' correspond to a lack of rotational symmetry around the polar axis for the mass distribution of Earth, i.e. to a "tri-axiality" of Earth.

For large values of ''n'' the coefficients above (that are divided by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'' + 1)&lt;/sup&gt; in ({{EquationNote|9}})) take very large values when for example kilometers and seconds are used as units. In the literature it is common to introduce some arbitrary "reference radius" ''R'' close to Earth's radius and to work with the dimensionless coefficients

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{J_n} = -\frac{J_n}{\mu\ R^n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{C_{n}^m} = -\frac{C_{n}^m}{\mu\ R^n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{S_{n}^m} = -\frac{S_{n}^m}{\mu\ R^n}&lt;/math&gt;

and to write the potential as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
u = -\frac{\mu }{r} \left(1 + \sum_{n=2}^{N_z}  \frac{\tilde{J_n} P^0_n(\sin\theta) }{{(\frac{r}{R})}^n} + \sum_{n=2}^{N_t} \sum_{m=1}^n \frac{ P^m_n(\sin\theta) (\tilde{C_{n}^m} \cos m\varphi + \tilde{S_{n}^m} \sin m\varphi)}{{(\frac{r}{R})}^n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

The dominating term (after the term −μ/''r'') in ({{EquationNote|9}}) is the "''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; term":

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{J_2\ P^0_2(\sin\theta)}{r^3} = J_2 \frac{1}{r^3} \frac{1}{2} (3\sin^2\theta -1) = J_2 \frac{1}{r^5} \frac{1}{2} (3 z^2 -r^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Relative the coordinate system
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\hat{\varphi}=-\sin \varphi \hat{x} + \cos \varphi \hat{y} \\
&amp;\hat{\theta}=-\sin \theta\ (\cos \varphi\ \hat{x} + \sin \varphi \hat{y})+ \cos\theta \hat{z} \\
&amp;\hat{r}= \cos \theta\ (\cos \varphi\ \hat{x}\ +\ \sin \varphi\ \hat{y})+\ \sin\theta\ \hat{z}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

&amp;F_r = -\frac{\partial u }{\partial r} = J_3 \frac{1}{r^5} 2 \sin\theta \left(5\sin^2\theta - 3\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

and

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

The exact numerical values for the coefficients deviate (somewhat) between different Earth models but for the lowest coefficients they all agree almost exactly.

For JGM-3 the values are:

:μ = 398600.440 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
:''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.7555 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
:''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = −2.619 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;

With a "reference radius" ''R'' of 6378.1363&amp;nbsp;km corresponding dimensionless parameters are

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{J_2} = 1.0826 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{J_3} = -2.532 \times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, at a radius of 6600&amp;nbsp;km (about 200&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface) ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/(''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r'') is about 0.002, i.e.
the correction to the "''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; force" from the "''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; term" is in the order of 2 permille. The negative value of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; implies that for a point mass in Earth's equatorial plane the gravitational force is tilted slightly towards the south due to the lack of symmetry for the mass distribution of Earth's "north–south".

==Recursive algorithms used for the numerical propagation of spacecraft orbits==

Spacecraft orbits are computed by the [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations|numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion|equation of motion]]. For this the gravitational force, i.e. the [[gradient]] of the potential, must be computed.  Efficient [[Recursion (mathematics)|recursive algorithms]] have been designed to compute the gravitational force for any &lt;math&gt;N_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; (the max degree of zonal and tesseral terms) and such algorithms are used in standard orbit propagation software.

===Available models===

The earliest Earth models in general use by [[NASA]] and [[European Space Research Organisation|ESRO]]/[[European Space Agency|ESA]] were the "Goddard Earth Models" developed by [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] denoted "GEM-1", "GEM-2", "GEM-3", and so on. Later the "Joint Earth Gravity Models" denoted "JGM-1", "JGM-2", "JGM-3" developed by [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in cooperation with universities and private companies became available. The newer models generally provided higher order terms than their precursors. The [[EGM96]] uses ''N&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 360 resulting in 130317 coefficients. An EGM2008 model is available as well.

For a normal Earth satellite requiring an orbit determination/prediction accuracy of a few meters the "JGM-3" truncated to ''N&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 36 (1365 coefficients) is usually sufficient. Inaccuracies from the modeling of the air-drag and to a lesser extent the solar radiation pressure will exceed the inaccuracies caused by the gravitation modeling errors.

==Spherical harmonics==

{{Main|Spherical harmonics}}

The following is a compact account of the spherical harmonics used to model Earth's gravitational field. The spherical harmonics are derived from the approach of looking for harmonic functions of the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\phi\ =\ R(r)\ \Theta(\theta)\ \Phi(\varphi)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

where (''r'', θ, φ) are the [[spherical coordinates]] defined by the equations ({{EquationNote|8}}). By straightforward calculations one gets that for any function ''f''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\ +\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\ +\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}\ =\ {1 \over r^2}{\partial \over \partial r}\left(r^2 {\partial f \over \partial r}\right) 
  + {1 \over r^2\cos\theta}{\partial \over \partial \theta}\left(\cos\theta {\partial f \over \partial \theta}\right) 
  + {1 \over r^2\cos^2\theta}{\partial^2 f \over \partial \varphi^2} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

Introducing the expression ({{EquationNote|16}}) in ({{EquationNote|17}}) one gets that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{r^2}{\phi}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2}\right)\ =
\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\frac{1}{\Theta\cos\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{\Phi\cos^2\theta}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\varphi^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

As the term 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
only depends on the variable &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Theta\cos\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\Phi\cos^2\theta}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\varphi^2} &lt;/math&gt;

only depends on the variables θ and φ. One gets that φ is harmonic if and only if 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)\ =\ \lambda
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}
and
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\Theta\cos\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\Phi\cos^2\theta}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\varphi^2}\ =\ -\lambda
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}
for some constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

From ({{EquationNote|20}}) then follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Theta}\ \cos\theta\ \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right)\ + \lambda\ \cos^2\theta\ +\ \frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\varphi^2}\ =\ 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first two terms only depend on the variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and the third only on the variable &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

From the definition of φ as a spherical coordinate it is clear that Φ(φ) must be periodic with the period 2π and one must therefore have that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\varphi^2}\ =\ -m^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

and
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\Theta}\ \cos\theta\ \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right)\ + \lambda\ \cos^2\theta=\ m^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|22}}}}

for some integer ''m'' as the family of solutions to ({{EquationNote|21}}) then are 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(\varphi)\ =a\ \cos m\varphi\ +\ b\ \sin m\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|23}}}}

With the variable substitution 
:&lt;math&gt;x=\sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

equation ({{EquationNote|22}}) takes the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2) \frac{d\Theta}{dx}\right)+\left(\lambda -\frac{m^2}{1-x^2} \right)\Theta=0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|24}}}}

From ({{EquationNote|19}}) follows that in order to have a solution &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;R(r) = \frac{1}{r^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

one must have that

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = n (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is a solution to the differential equation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\ \frac{dP_n}{dx}\right)\ +\ n(n+1)\ P_n\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|25}}}}

one therefore has that the potential corresponding to ''m'' = 0

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\ P_n(\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

'''which is rotational symmetric around the z-axis''' is an harmonic function

If &lt;math&gt;P_{n}^{m}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to the differential equation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\ \frac{dP_{n}^{m}}{dx}\right)\ +\ \left(n(n+1) -\frac{m^2}{1-x^2} \right)\ P_{n}^{m}\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|26}}}}

with ''m'' ≥ 1 one has the potential

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\ P_{n}^{m}(\sin\theta)\ (a\ \cos m\varphi\ +\ b\ \sin m\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|27}}}}

where ''a'' and ''b'' are arbitrary constants is a harmonic function that depends on φ and therefore is '''not''' rotational symmetric around the z-axis

The differential equation ({{EquationNote|25}}) is the Legendre differential equation for which the [[Legendre polynomials]] defined
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; P_{0}(x) = 1 \\
&amp; P_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{2^n n!}\ \frac{d^n(x^2-1)^n}{dx^n} \quad n \ge 1 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|28}}}}

are the solutions.

The arbitrary factor 1/(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!) is selected to make ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(−1)=−1 and ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(1) = 1 for odd ''n'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(−1) = ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(1) = 1 for even ''n''.

The first six Legendre polynomials are:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; P_{0}(x) = 1 \\
&amp; P_{1}(x) = x \\
&amp; P_{2}(x)=\frac{1}{2} \left(3x^2-1\right) \\
&amp; P_{3}(x)=\frac{1}{2} \left(5x^3-3x\right) \\
&amp; P_{4}(x)=\frac{1}{8} \left(35x^4-30x^2+3\right) \\
&amp; P_{5}(x)=\frac{1}{8} \left(63x^5-70x^3+15x\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|29}}}}

The solutions to differential equation ({{EquationNote|26}}) are the associated [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre functions]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  P_{n}^{m}(x)\ = (1-x^2)^{\frac{m}{2}}\ \frac{d^m P_n}{dx^m} \quad 1 \le m \le n
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|30}}}}

One therefore has that

:&lt;math&gt;
  P_{n}^{m}(\sin\theta)=\cos^m \theta\ \frac{d^n P_n}{dx^n} (\sin\theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

{{POV|date=August 2017}}
The '''Gokhale Method''' or '''Primal Posture''' method is a postural awareness technique developed by [[acupuncturist]] and yoga instructor Esther Gokhale.&lt;ref name="Khaleeli 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khaleeli|first1=Homa|title=A simple cure for back pain: grow up in the Ecuadorian mountains|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/a-simple-cure-for-back-pain-grow-up-in-the-ecuadorian-mountains|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method proposes that certain patterns exist in the way people in pre-modern and less industrialized societies move and adopt posture. Gokhale claims that these patterns, which she calls ''{{dfn|primal posture}}'', can be learned through practice. The method became popular in the beginning of the 2010s among professionals in the [[Silicon Valley]], where Gokhale is located.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schoenfeld|first1=Amy|title=Soothing Back Pain by Learning How to Sit Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/business/soothing-back-pain-by-learning-how-to-sit-again.html|accessdate= February 11, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kriegman|first1=Mitchell|title=The Gokhale Method|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/may/13/gokhale-method/|accessdate=February 11, 2017|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Esther Gokhale teaching at Ancestral Health Symposium 2013.png|thumb|Esther Gokhale teaching at the [[Ancestral Health Symposium]] in 2013.|200x200px]]
Gokhale started searching for a method to cope with her own back pain,&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014" /&gt; including [[sciatica]] and [[spinal disc herniation]] which began with her first pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doucleff|first1=Michaeleen|title=Lost Posture: Why Some Indigenous Cultures May Not Have Back Pain|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/08/412314701/lost-posture-why-indigenous-cultures-dont-have-back-pain|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[NPR]]|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She based the method on training in the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and from a French organization for postural awareness called the Aplomb Institute.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref
name="Wallace 2013" /&gt; Gokhale also spent ten years observing and photographing people's posture in less industrialized societies.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Charles|title=Exercises to tackle bad posture can avert back surgery|url=https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=December 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|archivedate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaswani 2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/you/sit-up-smart/articleshow/56721166.cms|title=Sit up smart|date=January 23, 2017|work=[[Bangalore Mirror]]|publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman and Co]]|last1=Vaswani|first1=Anjana|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gokhale started teaching in a studio at [[Palo Alto]], California.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;

The method quickly caught on in the [[Bay Area]], as she has been described as the "posture guru of Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; Apart from the United States, the method has been taught in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013" /&gt;

However, one of the main assumptions of the Gokhale Method, that people in less industrialized societies have less back pain,&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; is incorrect: mainstream science states back pain occurs to a similar extent in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Duthey B.

A '''guideline''' is a statement by which to determine a course of action. A guideline aims to streamline particular processes according to a set routine or sound practice. By definition, following a guideline is never mandatory. Guidelines are not binding and are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, http://www.va.gov/trm/TRMGlossaryPage.asp  &lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines may be issued by and used by any organization (governmental or private) to make the actions of its employees or divisions more predictable, and presumably of higher quality.

{{Hermeticism}}

The '''''Hermetica''''' are [[Egypt]]ian-[[Greece|Greek]] [[Wisdom literature|wisdom texts]] from the 2nd century AD and later, which are mostly presented as [[Plato#The dialogues|dialogues]] in which a teacher, generally identified as [[Hermes Trismegistus]] ("thrice-greatest [[Hermes]]"), [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightens]] a disciple. The texts form the basis of [[Hermeticism]]. They discuss the [[Divinity|divine]], the [[cosmos]], [[mind]], and [[nature]]. Some touch upon [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and related concepts.

==Scope==
The term particularly applies to the '''''Corpus Hermeticum''''', [[Marsilio Ficino]]'s Latin translation in fourteen tracts, of which eight [[incunabulum|early printed]] editions appeared before 1500 and a further twenty-two by 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[George Sarton]], review of [[Walter Scott (scholar)|Walter Scott]]'s ''Hermetica'', ''Isis'' '''8'''.2 (May 1926:343-346) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, which includes ''[[Poimandres]]'' and some addresses of Hermes to disciples Tat, Ammon and Asclepius, was said to have originated in the school of [[Ammonius Saccas]] and to have passed through the keeping of [[Michael Psellus]]: it is preserved in fourteenth century manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The last three tracts in modern editions were translated independently from another manuscript by Ficino's contemporary [[Lodovico Lazzarelli]] (1447–1500) and first printed in 1507. Extensive quotes of similar material are found in classical authors such as [[Joannes Stobaeus]].

Parts of the ''Hermetica'' appeared in the 4th-century Gnostic library found in [[Nag Hammadi]]. Other works in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and other languages may also be termed ''Hermetica'' — another famous tract is the ''[[Emerald Tablet]]'', which teaches the doctrine "as above, so below".

All these are themselves remnants of a more extensive literature, part of the [[syncretism|syncretic]], intellectualized paganism of their era, a cultural movement that also included the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic philosophy]] of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and late [[Orpheus|Orphic]] and [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] literature and influenced [[Gnosticism|Gnostic forms]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]]. There are significant differences:&lt;ref&gt;[[Roel van den Broek|Broek, Roelof Van Den]]. "Gnosticism and Hermitism in Antiquity: Two Roads to Salvation." In Broek, Roelof Van Den, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff. 1998. ''Gnosis and Hermeticism From Antiquity to Modern Times.'' Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hermetica are little concerned with [[Greek mythology]] or the technical minutiae of metaphysical [[Neoplatonism]]. The Hermetica are heavily influenced by [[Judaism]] and explicitly refer to Genesis 1:28.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Everett. Backgrounds of early Christianity. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003: pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, Brian P. Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a new English translation, with notes and introduction. Cambridge University Press, 1995: pg. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However most of these schools do agree in attributing the creation of the world to a [[Demiurge]] rather than the supreme being&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and in accepting [[reincarnation]]. Although [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosophers, who quote apocryphal works of [[Orpheus]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Pythagoras]] and other figures, almost never cite [[Hermes Trismegistus]], the tracts were still popular enough in the 5th century to be argued against by [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ls.poly.edu/~jbain/mms/texts/mmsaugustine.htm vii.23&amp;ndash;26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and antiquity==
The extant Egyptian-Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices, such as the veneration of images. Their concerns are practical in nature, their end is a spiritual rebirth through the enlightenment of the mind:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing within myself an immaterial vision that came from the mercy of God, I went out of myself into an immortal body, and now I am not what I was before. I have been born in mind!&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Hermeticum'' XIII.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While they are difficult to date with precision, the texts of the ''Corpus'' were likely redacted between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. During the Renaissance these texts were believed to be of ancient Egyptian origin and even today some readers believe them to date from [[ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]]. Since [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] dwelt upon the great antiquity of the Egyptian teachings upon which the philosopher purported to draw, scholars were willing to accept that these texts were the sources of Greek ideas. However the classical scholar [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614) successfully argued that some, mainly those dealing with philosophy, betrayed too recent a vocabulary. Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of [[alchemy]] clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the ''Asclepius'', lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as intellectually eclectic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html Secretum secretorum – An Overview of Magic in the Greco-Roman World]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of [[Syncretism|syncretic]] cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, Garth, The Egyptian Hermes : a historical approach to the late pagan mind (Cambridge/New York : Cambridge University Press), 1986&lt;/ref&gt; There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian [[wisdom literature]], which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a "father" to a "son".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Mahé]], "Preliminary Remarks on the Demotic "Book of Thoth" and the Greek Hermetica" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''50'''.4 (1996:353-363) p.358f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (late Egyptian) [[Papyrus|papyri]] contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Jasnow and Karl-Th. Zausich, "A Book of Thoth?" (paper given at the 7th International Congress of Egyptologists: Cambridge, 3–9 September 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]] states that some texts in the Hermetic corpus date back to the 6th century BC during the Persian period.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical References in the Hermetic writings," Transactions of the Third International Congress of the History of Religions. Oxford I (1908) pp. 196-225 and Personal Religion in Egypt before Christianity. New York: Harpers (1909) pp. 85-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between the Demotic texts and Platonic philosophy could be the result of Plato and his followers' having drawn on Egyptian sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Bernal|Bernal, Martin]], "Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization", volume I, p. 465. n. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1996/96.04.05.html Martin Bernal's review of Mary Lefkowitz' "Not Out of Africa" (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
Many hermetic texts were lost to [[Western culture]] during the [[Middle Ages]] but rediscovered in Byzantine copies and popularized in [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]]. The impetus for this revival came from the [[Latin]] translation by [[Marsilio Ficino]], a member of the [[Cosimo de' Medici|de' Medici]] [[court (royal)|court]], who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as ''De potestate et sapientia Dei''.&lt;ref&gt;Among the treasures of the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam is this ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as published in 1471.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hermetica'' provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on [[alchemy]] and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir [[Thomas Browne]].

Although the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine Greek]]. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the ''Emerald Tablet'', known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic [[Nag Hammadi Library]], discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called ''[[The Ogdoad and the Ennead]]'', a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, ''Hermès en Haute Egypte'' 2 vols. (Quebec) 1978, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard editions==
[[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]]'s historically important 1650 translation into [[English language|English]] of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'', entitled ''The Divine Pymander in XVII books'' (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars. The modern standard editions are the Budé edition by A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugière (Greek and French, 1946, repr. 1991) and Brian P. Copenhaver (English, 1992).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''Historical theology''' as a branch of [[theology]] investigates the socio-historical and cultural mechanisms that give rise to theological ideas, statements, and systems.   The field focuses on the relationship between [[theology]] and its contexts, as well as on the major theological or philosophical influences upon the figures and topics studied. Its methodological foundation and aims are similar to those used by intellectual historians researching historical epistemology, particularly those such as Matthew Daniel Eddy, who investigate the cultural connections between theology and other disciplines that existed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Cognitive Unity of Calvinist Pedagogy in Enlightenment Scotland|journal=in Ábrahám Kovács (Ed.), Reformed Churches Working Unity in Diversity: Global Historical, Theological and Ethical perspectives|date=(Budapest: L’Harmattan, 2016)|pages=46–60.|url=https://www.academia.edu/28249746/_The_Cognitive_Unity_of_Calvinist_Pedagogy_in_Enlightenment_Scotland_in_Ábrahám_Kovács_Ed._Reformed_Churches_Working_Unity_in_Diversity_Global_Historical_Theological_and_Ethical_perspectives_Budapest_L_Harmattan_2016_46-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''illusion of external agency''' is a set of [[attributional bias]]es consisting of illusions of influence, insight and benevolence, proposed by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], [[Timothy D. Wilson]], Ryan Brown and Elizabeth Pinel.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Illusion of External Agency |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2000 |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=690–700 |url=http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20%28External%20Agency%29.PDF |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.690 |pmid=11079235 |last1=Gilbert |first1=Daniel T. |last2=Brown |first2=Ryan P. |last3=Pinel |first3=Elizabeth C. |last4=Wilson |first4=Timothy D. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085559/http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20%28External%20Agency%29.PDF |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Daniel|title=The vagaries of religious experience|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gilbert05/gilbert05_index.html|publisher=Edge.org|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of experiments, experimenters induced participants to [[cognitive dissonance|rationalize]] a choice or experience (called the "optimizing" condition) after which they were more likely to make certain attributions of an external agent, as follows:
* ''illusion of influence''. Subjects who had been induced to rationalize liking for a teammate were more likely to attribute this liking to the influence of "subliminal messages" which experimenters claimed to have attempted to influence them to the best outcome. In this experiment the experimenters were presumed to have "insight" into the problem and "benevolence" towards participants.
* ''illusion of insight''. Subjects listened to a song chosen for them by a "SmartRadio" that they were told was benevolent and effective. Some subjects were informed of and rated the song before listening, and these subjects rated the song more highly and were more likely to continue using it, attributing their liking to the device's "insight".
* ''illusion of benevolence''. Subjects were given a gift; some rated it before receiving it and some rated it afterwards. Those in the afterwards condition rated it more highly (''[[endowment effect]]''). All participants were told that they were given the gift by another (unseen) participant as the best gift for them based on a questionnaire; those in the afterwards condition were more likely to believe that their liking was due to the benevolence of the gift-giver.

Gilbert ''et al.'' argued that "participants confused their own optimization of subjective reality with an external agents' optimizing of objective reality. Simply speaking, participants mistook 'the magic in here' for 'the magic out there.'"&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

An '''indigenous language''' or '''autochthonous language''' is a [[language]] that is native to a region and spoken by [[indigenous people]]. This language would be from a linguistically distinct [[community]] that has been settled in the area for many generations. Indigenous languages are not necessarily [[national language]]s, and the reverse is also true.

Many indigenous peoples worldwide have [[endangered language|stopped passing on]] their ancestral languages to the next generation, and have instead [[language shift|adopted]] the [[majority language]] as part of their [[acculturation]] into the [[majority culture]]. Furthermore, many indigenous languages have been subject to [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing).&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 55-56 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing their vulnerability, the [[United Nations]] proclaimed 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages, "to draw attention to the critical loss of indigenous languages and the urgent need to preserve, revitalize and promote indigenous languages."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, 71st session, Third Committee, 16 November 2016 [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.3/71/L.17/Rev.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Many indigenous languages are disappearing as there are no longer any young people left to speak those languages, so their remaining speakers are dying out.&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "''In Defense of Difference''." 7 October 2008. Seed Magazine. 29 January 2009 [http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, since 1600 at least 52 [[Native American languages]] have disappeared. Globally, there may be more than 7,000 languages that exist in the world today, though many of them have not been recorded because they belong to tribes in rural areas of the world or are not easily accessible. It is estimated that 6,809 "living" languages exist in the world today, with 90% having fewer than 100,000 speakers. This means that roughly 6,100 languages are facing a risk of eventual extinction. Some languages are very close to disappearing. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Forty six languages are known to have just one native speaker while 357 languages have fewer than 50 speakers. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than more common ones.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Steve. "Alarm Raised on World's Disappearing Languages." 15 May 2003. Common Dreams. Org. 21 February 2009 [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/alarm-raised-on-worlds-disappearing-languages-104768.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Oklahoma]] provides the backdrop for an example of language loss in the developed world. It boasts the highest density of indigenous languages in the United States. This includes languages originally spoken in the region, as well as those of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes from other areas that were [[Indian removal|forcibly relocated onto reservations]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "''Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages''." 2009. National Geographic. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government drove the [[Yuchi]] from [[Tennessee]] to Oklahoma in the early 19th century. Until the early 20th century, most Yuchi tribe members spoke the language fluently. Then, government boarding schools severely punished American Indian students who were overheard speaking their own language. To avoid beatings and other punishments, Yuchi, and other Indian children abandoned their native languages in favor of English.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2005, only five elderly members of the Yuchi tribe were fluent in the language. These remaining speakers spoke Yuchi fluently before they went to school and have maintained the language despite strong pressure to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This situation was not limited to Oklahoma.  In the Northwest Pacific plateau there are no speakers left of the indigenous tribal languages from that area, all the way to [[British Columbia]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oregon's [[Siletz Reservation|Siletz reservation]], established in 1855, was home to the endangered language [[Tolowa language|Siletz Dee-ni]]. The reservation held members of 27 different Indian bands speaking many languages. In order to communicate, people adopted [[Chinook Jargon]], a [[pidgin]] or hybrid language. Between the use of [[Chinook Jargon]] and the increased presence of English, the number of speakers of indigenous languages dwindled.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other tribes of Native Americans were also forced into government schools and reservations. They were also treated badly if they did not become "civilized". This meant they were to go to Christian churches and speak English. They were forced to give up their tribal religious beliefs and languages. Now, these Native Americans are trying to regain some of their lost heritage. They gather at "[[Pow-wow]]" to share culture, stories, remedies, dances, music, rhythms, recipes and heritage with anyone who wants to learn them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In January 2008, in Anchorage, Alaska, friends and relatives gathered to bid their last farewell to 89 year old Marie Smith Jones, a beloved matriarch of her community. "As they bid her farewell to her, they also bid farewell to the [[Eyak language]] as Marie was the last fluent speaker of the language."&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "In Defense of Difference." 7 October 2008. ''Seed Magazine''. 29 January 2009 2009[http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Isle of Man]], following the decline in the use of [[Manx language|Manx]] during the 19th century, {{lang|gv|Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly [[Language revitalization|revival]] had begun to spread and many people had learned Manx as a second language. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers.

==Learning==
Hundreds of indigenous languages around the world are taught by traditional means, including vocabulary, grammar, readings and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6,000 others can be learned to some extent by listening to recordings made for other purposes, such as religious texts, where translations are available in more widely known languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries of the World|url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/countries|publisher=Global Recordings Network|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE MUSEUM|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Treasure language"==
The term "treasure language" was proposed by the [[Rama people]] of Nicaragua as an alternative to [[Heritage language]], Indigenous language and "ethnic language", names that are considered pejorative in the local context.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grinevald |first1=Colette |last2=Pivot |first2= Bénédicte |editor-last1=Jones |editor-first1=Mari |editor-last2=Ogilvie |editor-first2=Sarah |title=Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2013 |chapter=On the revitalization of a ‘treasure language’: The Rama Language Project of Nicaragua |chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/5387106/The_Revitalization_of_a_Treasure_Language_the_Rama_Language_Project_of_Nicaragua |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139245890.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now also used in the context of public storytelling events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Languages Treasured but Not Lost  |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/languages-treasured-but-not-lost/Content?oid=4679610 |work=East Bay Express |location=Oakland |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "treasure language" references the desire of speakers to sustain the use of their mother tongue into the future:
{{Quote|text=[The] notion of treasure fit the idea of something that had been buried and almost lost, but was being rediscovered and now shown and shared. And the word treasure also evoked the notion of something belonging exclusively to the Rama people, who now attributed it real value and had become eager and proud of being able to show it to others.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"/&gt;}}

Accordingly, the term may be considered to be distinct from [[Endangered language]] for which objective criteria are available, or [[Heritage language]] which describes an end-state for a language where individuals are more fluent in a dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hale |editor-first1=Kenneth |editor-last2=Hinton |editor-first2=Leanne |title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |date=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4870">The term "'''inverse consequences'''"&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; or the "'''Law of Inverse Consequences'''"&lt;ref name=NCSU/&gt; refers to results that are the opposite of the expected results as initially intended or planned.&lt;ref name="NCSU"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
One consequence is in the "reverse predicament" of the other.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;

==History==
The term "inverse consequences" has been in use for over 175 years (since at least 1835).&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;

  states "the influence of which upon them will be manifested
  by inverse consequences; the one being in the reverse
  predicament of the other."
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term was also used by [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) in his book ''System of Positive Polity'' (published 1875), stating, "Inevitable increase in Complication, in proportion with the decrease of Generality, gives rise to two inverse consequences."

==Documented examples==
The term "inverse consequences" has been applied in numerous situations, for example:

  -- or speculate. All opinions must have reliable sources.
  --&gt;
* In treatment of drug addiction, medications intended to reduce one type of addiction might trigger another addiction: long-term treatment with [[opiate]] medications (such as [[morphine]]) has ''inverse consequences''.&lt;ref name="ALaak"&gt;

  to sensitized response; long-term treatment with opiates
  (such as morphine) also has inverse consequences".
&lt;/ref&gt;
* In management of work tasks, a total sequential execution, of work tasks, has inverse consequences, such as a decrease of the workload with an increase of the lead time.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;

'''José Antonio Offerman Dono''' (born November 8, 1968) is a Dominican retired professional [[baseball]] player who played professional baseball for nearly 20 years. He played for 15 seasons in the [[Major League Baseball]] and has played 4 seasons of [[Independent league baseball|independent]] and [[Mexican League]] baseball since leaving MLB.

He most recently managed the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAX17wMMuC4&amp;feature=channel Video of José Offerman hitting an umpire] [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz]] of the [[Mexican League]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman looks to coach in MLB again after legal trouble|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2014/03/30/offerman-looks-to-coach-in-mlb-again-after-legal-trouble/|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After attending [[Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School]] in [[San Pedro de Macorís]], Offerman signed with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as an amateur [[free agent]] in 1986. In {{Baseball year|1988}}, he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]]. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the [[Montreal Expos]] on August 19, {{Baseball year|1990}} becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a [[home run]] in his first major league [[at-bat]].

==Major leagues==
By {{Baseball year|1992}}, Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the [[Florida Marlins]], striking out against [[Charlie Hough]]. He made his first appearance in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1995]] but was traded to the [[Kansas City Royals]] after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting [[second baseman]] job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in {{Baseball year|1998}}, when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in [[1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1999]].

Known more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in {{Baseball year|2000}}. He was sent to the [[Seattle Mariners]] during the {{Baseball year|2002}} season, but was released afterwards. In {{Baseball year|2003}}, he joined the [[Montreal Expos]] in [[spring training]] but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]]. In {{Baseball year|2004}}, he won a spot on the [[Minnesota Twins]] roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started {{Baseball year|2005}} with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the [[New York Mets]] and was called back up to the majors in June.

==Post-USA major leagues==
Most recently, Offerman played in the [[2008 Caribbean World Series]] for the [[Licey Tigers]] – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title.  During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 [[Rojos del Águila de Veracruz|Veracruz Red Eagles]] of the [[Mexican Summer League]].

In December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]].  With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao.  As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.)

On January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the [[Licey Tigers]] of the [[Dominican Winter League]], replacing Mike Guerrero.  With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido.  As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager.  At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament.

===Bat incident===
He has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. 
On August 14, {{Baseball year|2007}}, Offerman was thrown out of a Ducks game against the [[Bridgeport Bluefish]] for charging Bluefish pitcher [[Matt Beech]] with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher [[John Nathans]] was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career.&lt;ref name="ESPN-arrest"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beech and Nathans were taken to Bridgeport Hospital where they were treated and released.  After being removed from the game, Offerman was arrested by the [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] Police.&lt;ref name="CT-Post-arrest"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspension to remain in effect until legal proceedings finish|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2979699|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2007, Offerman pleaded not guilty to two second degree assault charges.&lt;ref name="ESPN-plea"&gt;{{cite news

His case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II.  On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called "[[Accelerated Rehabilitation]] ('AR')."  The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature.  The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future.&lt;ref name="ESPN-probation"&gt;{{cite news

Nathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has [[post-concussion syndrome]] and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3902057 Jose Offerman Sued By John Nathans] ESPN.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2009/05/12/a_dizzying_turn/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A dizzying turn | first=Stan | last=Grossfeld | date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offerman ordered to pay nearly $1M|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11282853/jose-offerman-ordered-pay-nearly-1-million-bat-attack-case|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominican Republic Winter League incident===
On 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/01/16/sports/s205458S68.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122003905/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2010%2F01%2F16%2Fsports%2Fs205458S68.DTL |archivedate=January 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerman, manager of the [[Licey Tigers]], came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the [[Cibao Giants]], to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire [[D.J. Reyburn]]. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not.

A day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |title=Levantan suspensión a José Offerman por golpear árbitro – Almomento.net: Periodico Digital Dominicano |publisher=Almomento.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809201348/http://www.almomento.net/articulo/130505/Levantan-suspension-a-Jose-Offerman-por-golpear-arbitro |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing [[Dave Jauss]] as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4836498 |title=José Offerman banned for life by Dominican league – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36828">The '''just-world hypothesis''' or '''just-world fallacy''' is the [[cognitive bias]] (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring [[morality|morally]] [[justice|fair]] and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic [[justice]], [[destiny]], [[divine providence]], [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], [[Balance (metaphysics)|stability]], or [[cosmos|order]], and has high potential to result in [[informal fallacy|fallacy]], especially when used to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] people's misfortune on the grounds that they "deserve" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the [[English language]] in various [[figures of speech]] that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: "[[wikt:get what's coming to one|you got what was coming to you]]", "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]", "[[wikt:chickens come home to roost|chickens come home to roost]]", "everything happens for a reason", and "[[wikt:reap what one sows|you reap what you sow]]". This hypothesis has been widely studied by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] since [[Melvin J. Lerner]] conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="An Overview"&gt;Lerner, M.J. &amp; Montada, L. (1998). An Overview: Advances in Belief in a Just World Theory and Methods, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeiPBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World]'' (1–7). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has continued since then, examining the predictive capacity of the hypothesis in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade"&gt;Furnham, A. (2003). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727 Belief in a just world: research progress over the past decade]. ''Personality and Individual Differences''; 34: 795–817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
Many philosophers and social theorists have observed and considered the phenomenon of belief in a just world, going back to at least as early as the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] writing around 180 CE who argued against this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism", Book 1, Chapter 13, Section 32&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner's work made the just-world hypothesis a focus of research in the field of social psychology.

===Melvin Lerner===
Lerner was prompted to study [[justice]] beliefs and the just-world hypothesis in the context of social psychological inquiry into negative social and societal interactions.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface"&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M.J. (1998). Preface, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. vii–viii). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner saw his work as extending [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiments|work on obedience]]. He sought to answer the questions of how regimes that cause cruelty and suffering maintain popular support, and how people come to accept [[social norms]] and laws that produce misery and suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=M. |last2=Simmons |first2=C. H. |year=1966 |title=Observer's Reaction to the 'Innocent Victim': Compassion or Rejection? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1037/h0023562 |pmid=5969146 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerner's inquiry was influenced by repeatedly witnessing the tendency of observers to [[victim blaming|blame victims]] for their suffering. During his clinical training as a psychologist, he observed treatment of mentally ill persons by the health care practitioners with whom he worked. Although he knew them to be kindhearted, educated people, they often blamed patients for the patients' own suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental"&gt;Lerner (1980). ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''. Plenum: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner also describes his surprise at hearing his students [[wikt:derogate|derogate]] (disparage, belittle) the poor, seemingly oblivious to the [[structural violence|structural forces]] that contribute to poverty.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; In a study on rewards, he observed that when one of two men was chosen at random to receive a reward for a task, that caused him to be more favorably evaluated by observers, even when the observers had been informed that the recipient of the reward was chosen at random.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking"&gt;Lerner, M. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1978). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26009-001 Just world research and the attribution process: Looking back and ahead]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 85(5), 1030–1051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Existing social psychological theories, including [[cognitive dissonance]], could not fully explain these phenomena.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages"&gt;Maes, J. (1998) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_10 Eight Stages in the Development of Research on the Construct of BJW?], in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. 163–185). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.

==Early evidence==
In 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female subjects were made to watch a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, subjects were upset by observing the apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to derogate the victim. Derogation was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when subjects were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, subjects did not derogate the victim.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver" /&gt; Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

==Theory==
To explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of "contract" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt;

Lerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.{{citation needed|date = December 2011}}

There are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt; Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;

An additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Linden, M. &amp; Maercker, A. (2011) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives].'' Wien: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. (1984). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-04021-001 Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 47(3), 494–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Veridical judgment===
{{See also|Veridicality}}
Others have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, B. &amp; Lowe, C. (1975). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-26823-001 Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 31, 944–951.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay &amp; L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205–229). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt reduction===
Another alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. &amp; Jones, E. (1960). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Davis3/publication/9847296_Changes_in_Interpersonal_Perception_as_a_Means_of_Reducing_Cognitive_Dissonance/links/00b7d519bfb9563e9e000000.pdf Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance]. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 61, 402–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. (1964). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression]. ''Journal of Personality'', 1964, 32, 531–549.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Kenrick, D. T., &amp; Hoerig, J. H. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-26028-001 Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(6), 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

===Discomfort reduction===

Alternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169–170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.&lt;ref name="Hafer2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=Bègue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429–444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional evidence==
After Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character.&lt;ref&gt;Reichle, B., Schneider, A., &amp; Montada, L. (1998). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_4 How do observers of victimization preserve their belief in a just world cognitively or actionally?] In L. Montada &amp; M. J. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 55–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, social psychologists [[Zick Rubin]] and Letitia Anne Peplau developed a measure of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, A. (1973). [https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00104.x Belief in a just world and reactions to another's lot: A study of participants in the national draft lottery]. ''Journal of Social Issues'', 29, 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure and its revised form published in 1975 allowed for the study of individual differences in just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name = "RubinPeplau1975"&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, L.A. (1975). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073011/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Publications_files/Rubin%20%26%20Peplau%201975s.pdf Who believes in a just world?] ''Journal of Social Issues'', 31, 65–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the subsequent research on the just-world hypothesis used these [[psychometrics|measurement scales]].

===Violence===
Researchers have looked at how observers react to victims of [[rape]] and other [[violence]]. In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R., Timko, C., &amp; Carli, L. L. (1985). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Timko/publication/223081344_Cognitive_biases_in_blaming_the_victim/links/59dd3d88aca272b698e141ab/Cognitive-biases-in-blaming-the-victim.pdf Cognitive biases in blaming the victim]. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 21(2), 161–177.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carli, L. L. (1999). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.830.8628&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(8), 966–979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]]. One study found that observers' labels of blame of female victims of relationship violence increase with the intimacy of the relationship. Observers blamed the perpetrator only in the most significant case of violence, in which a male struck an acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, G., &amp; Feldman, N. S. (1984). [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1984.2.4.339 Blaming the victim versus blaming the perpetrator:An attributional analysis of spouse abuse]. ''Symposium A Quarterly Journal In Modern Foreign Literatures'', 2(4), 339–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
Researchers have employed the just-world hypothesis to understand [[bullying]]. Given other research on beliefs in a just world, it would be expected that observers would derogate and blame bullying victims, but the opposite has been found: individuals high in just-world belief have stronger anti-bullying [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, C. L., Elder, T., Gater, J., &amp; Johnson, E. (2010). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000709909X479105 The association between adolescents' beliefs in a just world and their attitudes to victims of bullying]. ''The British journal of educational psychology'', 80(Pt 2), 183–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that strong belief in a just world is associated with lower levels of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2008). School Bullying. ''European Psychologist'', 13(4), 248254.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in keeping with Lerner's understanding of belief in a just world as functioning as a "contract" that governs behavior.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt; There is additional evidence that belief in a just world is protective of the well-being of children and adolescents in the school environment,&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., Kamble, S. V., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2009). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615800902729242 Belief in a just world and well-being of bullies, victims and defenders: a study with Portuguese and Indian students]. Anxiety, stress, and coping, 22(5), 497–508.&lt;/ref&gt; as has been shown for the [[#Positive health effects|general population]].

===Illness===
Other researchers have found that observers judge sick people as responsible for their illnesses. One experiment showed that persons suffering from a variety of illnesses were derogated on a measure of attractiveness more than healthy individuals were. In comparison to healthy people, victim derogation was found for persons presenting with indigestion, pneumonia, and stomach cancer. Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruman, J. C., &amp; Sloan, R. P. (1983). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp0401_4 Disease as Justice: Perceptions of the Victims of Physical Illness]. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 4(1), 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of [[AIDS]] victims.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS"&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1992). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679204500303 Sphere-specific just world beliefs and attitudes to AIDS]. Human Relations, 45, 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
More recently, researchers have explored how people react to [[poverty]] through the lens of the just-world hypothesis. Strong belief in a just world is associated with blaming the poor, with weak belief in a just world associated with identifying external causes of poverty including world economic systems, [[war]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., Wagstaff, G. F., Newton, J. T., &amp; Harrison, K. R. (1990). [http://inesad.edu.bo/developmentroast/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Harper-1990-Poverty-Explanations.pdf Lay causal perceptions of third world poverty and the just world theory]. ''Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal'', 18(2), 235–238. Scientific Journal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., &amp; Manasse, P. R. (1992). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-29152-001 The Just World and the Third World: British explanations for poverty abroad]. ''The Journal of social psychology'', 6. Heldref Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self as victim===
{{See also|Psychological response to rape|Self blame}}
Some research on belief in a just world has examined how people react when they themselves are victimized. An early paper by Dr. Ronnie Janoff-Bulman found that rape victims often blame their own behavior, but not their own characteristics, for their [[victimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R. (1979). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22629118_Characterological_versus_behavioral_self-blame_Inquiries_into_depression_and_rape/links/54244b5b0cf238c6ea6eac09.pdf Characterological versus behavioral self-blame: inquiries into depression and rape]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 37(10), 1798–809.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that this may be because blaming one's own behavior makes an event more [[locus of control|controllable]].

These studies on victims of [[#Violence|violence]], [[#Illness|illness]], and [[#Poverty|poverty]] and others like them have provided consistent support for the link between observers' just-world beliefs and their tendency to blame victims for their suffering.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; As a result, the existence of the just-world hypothesis as a psychological phenomenon has become widely accepted.

==Theoretical refinement==
Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world,&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C., Lipkus, I. M., Sallay, H., &amp; Goch, I. (2001). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000556 A just and unjust world: Structure and validity of different world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 30, 561–577.&lt;/ref&gt; beliefs in [[immanent]] [[justice]] and ultimate justice,&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J. (1998). Immanent justice and ultimate justice: two ways of believing in justice. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.),  ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 9–40). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hope for justice, and belief in one's ability to reduce injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Mohiyeddini, C., &amp; Montada, L. (1998).

Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 43–53). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS" /&gt; An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with [[Just-world hypothesis#Positive mental health effects|positive mental health]].&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal" /&gt;

==Correlates==
Researchers have used measures of [[belief]] in a just world to look at correlates of high and low levels of belief in a just world.

Limited studies have examined ideological correlates of the belief in a just world. These studies have found sociopolitical correlates of just-world beliefs, including [[right-wing authoritarianism]] and the [[protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A. J., Burroughs, T., &amp; Nguyen, T. (1999). [https://sites.google.com/site/alambertpsychology/publications/Lambertetal-riskperception.pdf Perceptions of risk and the buffering hypothesis: The role of just world beliefs and right wing authoritarianism]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(6), 643–656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1989). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1989.tb00880.x Belief in a just world: review and critique of the individual difference literature]. ''British Journal of Social Psychology'', 28, 365–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of [[religiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900002245 Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375–382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07654-003 Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events]. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of demographic differences, including [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]] differences, have not shown systematic differences, but do suggest racial differences, with blacks and African Americans having the lowest levels of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, L., &amp; Cann, A. (1994). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1994.9923011 Differences in assumptions about a just world: ethnicity and point of view]. ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 134, 765–770.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, M. (2000). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864385 Status, religion, and the ''belief in a just world'': comparing African Americans, Latinos, and Whites]. ''Social Science Quarterly'', 81, 325–343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of measures of just-world beliefs has also allowed researchers to assess cross-cultural differences in just-world beliefs. Much research conducted shows that beliefs in a just world are evident cross-culturally. One study tested beliefs in a just world of students in 12 countries. This study found that in countries where the majority of inhabitants are powerless, belief in a just world tends to be weaker than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1993). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1993.9712149 Just world beliefs in twelve societies]. ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 133, 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the theory of the just-world hypothesis because the powerless have had more personal and societal experiences that provided evidence that the world is not just and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1992). Relationship knowledge and attitudes towards AIDS. ''Psychological Reports'', 71, 1149–1150.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=I assume you mean to say 'neither just nor predictable.'|date=February 2014}}

Belief in unjust world has been linked to increased self-handicapping, criminality, defensive coping, anger and perceived future risk. It may also serve as ego-protective belief for certain individuals by justifying maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lench|first1=Chang|title=Belief in an Unjust World: When Beliefs in a Just World Fail|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2007|volume=89|issue=2|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/00223890701468477|pmid=17764390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=Dariusz|title=The belief in an unjust world: An egotistic delusion|journal=Social Justice Research|date=1996|volume=9|issue=3|pages=213–221|doi=10.1007/BF02197248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

===Positive mental health effects===
Although much of the initial work on belief in a just world focused on its negative social effects, other research suggests that belief in a just world is good, and even necessary, for [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C. (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sbKCnhCPaSgC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20justice%20motive%20as%20a%20personal%20resource%3A%20dealing%20with%20challenges%20and%20critical%20life%20events%22 The justice motive as a personal resource: dealing with challenges and critical life events].'' New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a just world is associated with greater [[life satisfaction]] and well-being and less depressive affect.&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal"&gt;Lipkus, I. M., Dalbert, C., &amp; Siegler, I. C. (1996). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167296227002 The Importance of Distinguishing the Belief in a Just World for Self Versus for Others: Implications for Psychological Well-Being]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 22(7), 666–677.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, C., Benson, D. E., &amp; Snyder, C. (1990). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1389045 Belief in a just world and depression]. ''Sociological Perspective'', 25, 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are actively exploring the reasons why the belief in a just world might have this relationship to mental health; it has been suggested that such beliefs could be a personal resource or [[coping (psychology)|coping strategy]] that buffers [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with daily life and with [[psychological trauma|traumatic events]].&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner"&gt;Hafer, C., &amp; Olson, J. (1998). Individual differences in beliefs in a just world and responses to personal misfortune. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 65–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that belief in a just world can be understood as a [[positive illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., &amp; Brown, J. (1988). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c6/b13d227783a3466d7a0903d9ebb111904502.pdf Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies also show that beliefs in a just world are correlated with internal [[locus of control]].&lt;ref name="RubinPeplau1975" /&gt; Strong belief in a just world is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life.&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner" /&gt; This may be one way in which belief in a just world affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs in a just world for oneself. Beliefs in a just world for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R., &amp; Douglas, K. (2005). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690500070X Justice for all, or just for me? More evidence of the importance of the self-other distinction in just-world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39(3), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International research===
More than 40 years after Lerner's seminal work on belief in a just world, researchers continue to study the phenomenon. Work continues primarily in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Researchers in Germany have contributed disproportionately to recent research.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; Their work resulted in a volume edited by Lerner and German researcher Leo Montada titled ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World''.&lt;ref&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M. (Eds.) (1998) ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">The '''''Ker''-''Frisbie'' doctrine''' is applied in the context of [[extradition]] and generally holds that criminal defendants may be prosecuted in [[United States]] courts regardless of whether their presence has been obtained through the use of applicable extradition treaties.

== History ==
In ''[[Ker v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|119|436|1886}}, a messenger forcibly kidnapped the defendant from [[Peru]] and brought him back to the United States, even though he had been sent to Peru with a valid [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] and instructions to obtain the defendant with the cooperation of the local authorities. Addressing Ker's [[due process]] challenge, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that "such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when brought within the jurisdiction of the court which has the right to try him for such an offence, and presents no valid objection to his trial in such court".

''[[Frisbie v. Collins]]'', {{ussc|342|519|1952}}, presented a case in which the defendant was tried in [[Michigan]] after being abducted by Michigan authorities in [[Chicago]]. Applying its decision in ''Ker'', the Supreme Court upheld the conviction over challenges based on [[due process]] and federal [[kidnapping]] laws. 

More recently, the Supreme Court relied on the Ker–Frisbie doctrine in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', {{ussc|504|655|1992}}. Álvarez Machaín, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen, was abducted and brought to the United States at the direction of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. The Court rejected the argument that such abductions undermine the usefulness of extradition treaties, and it refused to read general principles of [[international law]] weighing against such abductions into the Mexican extradition treaty.

"'''Language speaks'''" (in the original [[German language|German]] ''Die Sprache spricht''), is a famous saying by [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger first formulated it in his 1950 lecture "Language" (''Die Sprache''),&lt;ref name="Lyon06"&gt;Lyon (2006) pp.128-9&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently repeated it in later works.&lt;ref name="Philipse98"&gt;Philipse (1998) p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] expressed a related idea when he said that language "acquires a voice" and "speaks itself."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Strathausen (2003) The look of things: poetry and vision around 1900, Volume 8, Issue 126, p.148-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Language" lecture==
The saying was first formulated by Heidegger in the lecture ''Language" ("Die Sprache") in memory of [[Max Kommerell]], first delivered on October 7, 1950 at the [[Bühlerhöhe]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1959) ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'', references section, p.259, quote:{{quotation|Vortrag vom 7. Oktober 1950 auf Bühlerhöhe zum Gedächtnis von Max Kommerell und am 14. Februar 1951 bei der Württembergischen Bibliotheksgesellschaft in Stuttgart wiederholt.}} translation by [[Albert Hofstadter]] in Heidegger (1971), p.xxv, quote: 
{{quotation|"Language" &lt;br&gt;
"Die Sprache," in ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'' (Pfullingen: Neske, 1959). In this volume's references Heidegger writes: "The lecture was given on October 7, 1950, at Bühlerhöhe in memory of Max Kommerell and was repeated on February 14, 1951, at the Württembergischen Bibliotheksgesellschaft in Stuggart. The lecture, hitherto unpublished, has become known in the form of many transcripts and notes."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture was translated in English by [[Albert Hofstadter]] in the 1971 Heidegger collection ''Poetry, Language, Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;"Language", in Heidegger (1971) pp.187-ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting a [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]]'s 1784 letter to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], Heidegger talks of language as an "[[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]."

{{Descartes}}
'''Mental substance''' is the idea held by [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] and [[idealism|idealists]], that minds are made-up of non-physical substance. This substance is often referred to as [[consciousness]].

This is opposed to the [[materialism|materialists]], who hold that what we normally think of as mental substance is ultimately physical matter (i.e., brains).

[[René Descartes|Descartes]], who was most famous for the assertion "[[I think therefore I am]]", has had a lot of influence on the [[mind–body problem]]. He describes his theory of mental substance (which he calls '''''res cogitans''''' distinguishing it from the ''[[res extensa]]'') in the ''Second [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditation]]'' (II.8) and in ''[[Principia Philosophiae]]'' (2.002).

He used a more precise definition of the word "substance" than is currently popular: that a substance is something which can exist without the existence of any other substance. For many philosophers, this word or the phrase "mental substance" has a special meaning.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]], belonging to the generation immediately after Descartes, held the position that the mental world was built up by [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s, mental objects that are not part of the physical world (see ''[[Monadology]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29782">'''Modernization theory''' is used to explain the process of modernization within societies. Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' society. Modernization theory originated from the ideas of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920), which provided the basis for the modernization paradigm developed by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979). The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse.  It made a comeback after 1991 but remains a controversial model.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Knobl, "Theories That Won’t Pass Away: The Never-ending Story." in  Gerard Delanty, Engin F. Isin, eds. ''Handbook of Historical Sociology'' (2003): 96–107 esp p. 97 [http://193.231.20.29/seminarii/locuire/Upload/syllabus09/C09b.%20Knobl%20(2003).pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[world-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalization]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies.
Modernization theory maintains that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production, it is argued, make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique of modern difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. It also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.&lt;ref name="HttpwwwbritannicacomEBcheckedtopicmodernization"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization modernization Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians link modernization to the processes of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] and the spread of education. As Kendall (2007) notes, "Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization."&lt;ref&gt;Diana Kendall, ''Sociology in Our Times'' (2007) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociological]] [[critical theory]], modernization is linked to an overarching process of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society.

==Origins==
Sociological theories of the late 19th century such as [[Social Darwinism]] provided a basis for asking what were the laws of evolution of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Henry. "Modernization theory and the sociological study of development" ''Journal of Development Studies'' 7#2 (1971): 141–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The current modernization theory originated with the ideas  of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) regarding the role of rationality and irrationality in the transition from traditional to modern society. Weber's approach provided the basis for the modernization paradigm as popularized by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979), who translated Weber's works into English in the 1930s and provided his own interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremiah I. Dibua|title=Modernization and the Crisis of Development in Africa: The Nigerian Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRLBjz2pWQMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate|pages=20–22|isbn=9780754642282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon H. Mayhew, ed., ''Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution: selected writings'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945 the Parsonian version became widely used in sociology and other social sciences.  By the late 1960s opposition developed because the theory was too general and did not fit all societies in quite the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization and modernization ==
[[Globalization]] can be defined as the integration of economic, political and social cultures. It is argued that globalization is related to the spreading of modernization across borders.

Global trade has grown continuously since the European discovery of new continents in the [[Early modern period]]; it increased particularly as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the mid-20th century adoption of the [[shipping container]].

Annual trans-border tourist arrivals rose to 456 million by 1990 and almost tripled since, reaching a total of over 1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;(Knowles, 1994: FT,7 January 1997: V11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.unwto.org/press-release/2017-01-17/sustained-growth-international-tourism-despite-challenges|title=Sustained growth in international tourism despite challenges {{!}} World Tourism Organization UNWTO|website=www2.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication is another major area that has grown due to modernization. Communication industries have enabled capitalism to spread throughout the world. Telephony, television broadcasts, news services and online service providers have played a crucial part in globalization. Former U.S president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was a supporter of the modernization theory and believed that television had potential to provide educational tools in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindo-Fuentes|first=Héctor|date=2009|title=Educational Television in El Salvador and Modernisation Theory|jstor=27744205|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=41|issue=4|pages=757–792|doi=10.2307/27744205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the many apparent positive attributes to globalization there are also negative consequences. The dominant, neoliberal model of globalization often increases disparities between a society's rich and its poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/feminism-globalization/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Parekh|first=Serena|last2=Wilcox|first2=Shelley|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} In major cities of developing countries there exist pockets where technologies of the modernised world, computers, cell phones and satellite television, exist alongside stark poverty. Globalists are globalization modernization theorists and argue that globalization is positive for everyone, as its benefits must eventually extend to all members of society, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.

== Democratization and modernization ==
The relationship between modernization and democracy is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. “Lipset’s observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,” (Przeworski and Limongi, 1997).

Larry Diamond and Juan Linz, who worked with Lipset in the book, ''Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America'', argue that economic performance affects the development of democracy in at least three ways. First, they argue that economic growth is more important for democracy than given levels of socioeconomic development. Second, socioeconomic development generates social changes that can potentially facilitate democratization. Third, socioeconomic development promotes other changes, like organization of the middle class, which is conducive to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;(Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America, pp 44-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, "All the various aspects of economic development — industrialization, urbanization, wealth and education — are so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man'' (1963), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument also appears in Walt W. Rostow, ''Politics and the Stages of Growth'' (1971); A. F. K. Organski, ''The Stages of Political Development'' (1965); and David Apter, ''The Politics of Modernization'' (1965). In the 1960s, some critics argued that the link between modernization and democracy was based too much on the example of European history and neglected the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gunder Frank, ''Latin America: Underdevelopment or Revolution'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent demonstrations of the emergence of democracy in [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[South Africa]] have been cited as support for Lipset's thesis.

One historical problem with that argument has always been [[German Empire|Germany]] whose economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the democratization after 1918. Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for "during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development".&lt;ref&gt;Sheri E. Berman, "Modernization in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany,"  ''World Politics'' v.53#3 (2001) 431–62 quote at p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] (2009) contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]], "How Development Leads to Democracy," ''Foreign Affairs'' Mar/Apr2009, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp. 33–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Peerenboom (2008) explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]] and [[India]], which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom, ''China Modernizes: Threat to the West or Model for the Rest?'' (2008) p, 63. He suggests [[China]] will grant democratic rights when it is as modern and as rich as the West per capita.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Przeworski]] and others have challenged Lipset's argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Epstein, et al., "Democratic Transitions," ''American Journal of Political Science'' 2006 50(3): 551–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly contentious is the idea that modernization implies more human rights, with China in the 21st century being a major test case.

==Technology==
New [[technology]] is a major source of social change. (Social change refers to any significant alteration over time in behavior patterns and cultural values and norms.) Since modernization entails the social transformation from agrarian societies to industrial ones, it is important to look at the technological viewpoint; however, new technologies do not change societies by itself. Rather, it is the ''response'' to technology that causes change. Frequently, technology is recognized but not put to use for a very long time such as the ability to extract metal from rock.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Although that initially went unused, it later had profound implications for the developmental course of societies. Technology makes it possible for a more innovated society and broad social change. That dramatic change through the centuries that has evolved socially, industrially, and economically, can be summed up by the term modernization. Cell phones, for example, have changed the lives of millions throughout the world. That is especially true in [[Africa]] and other parts of the [[Middle East]], where there is a low cost communication infrastructure. With cell phone technology, widely dispersed populations are connected, which facilitates business-to-business communication and provides internet access to remoter areas, with a consequential rise in literacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Development and modernization==
Development, like modernization, has become the orienting principle of modern times. Countries that are seen as modern are also seen as developed, which means that they are generally more respected by institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and even as possible trade partners for other countries. The extent to which a country has modernized or developed dictates its power and importance on the international level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Modernization of the health sector of developing nations recognizes that transitioning from '[[traditional]]' to 'modern' is not merely the advancement in technology and the introduction of Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agenda and, in turn, an increase in funding by feeders and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of [[industrialization]] or [[colonialism]], underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. That has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through '[[barefoot doctors]]'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the DE-emphasis of medical institutions was [[Halfdan T. Mahler]], the [[WHO]] General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as [[Alma Alta Declaration|Alma-Ats]] and the "Health and Population in Development" conference, sponsored by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in [[Italy]] in 1979, and selective primary healthcare and [[GOBI-FFF|GOBI]] were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, this is not to say that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well-intention programs, foundations, and charities that target epidemics such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people and impeded future development.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1864–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization theorists often saw traditions as obstacles to economic growth. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, economic conditions are heavily determined by the cultural, social values present in that given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elites in Latin America|last=Lipset|first=Seymour Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=New York|page=3|chapter=Chapter 1: Values, Education, and Entrepreneurship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while modernization might deliver violent, radical change for [[traditional society|traditional societies]], it was thought worth the price. Critics insist that traditional societies were often destroyed without ever gaining the promised advantages if, among other things, the economic gap between advanced societies and such societies actually increased. The net effect of modernization for some societies was therefore the replacement of traditional poverty by a more modern form of [[wikt:misery|misery]], according to these critics.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, ''Quand la misère chasse la pauvreté'', Arles: Actes Sud 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to improvements in living standards, physical infrastructure, education and economic opportunity to refute such criticisms.

==Criticism==
From the 1960s, modernization theory has been criticized by numerous scholars, including  [[Andre Gunder Frank]] (1929 – 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sing Chew and Pat Lauderdale, eds. ''Theory and methodology of world development: The writings of Andre Gunder Frank'' (Springer, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (born 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol, "Wallerstein's world capitalist system: a theoretical and historical critique." ''American Journal of Sociology'' (1977) 82#5 pp. 1075–90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2777814 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition, ''modern'' simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern and argue that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. That view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non western society. Others argue that [[Japan]] has become distinctly more western as a result of its modernization.

As Tipps has argued, by conflating modernization with other processes, with which theorists use interchangeably (democratization, liberalization, development), the term becomes imprecise and therefore difficult to disprove.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has also been criticised empirically, as modernization theorists ignore external sources of change in societies. The binary between traditional and modern is unhelpful, as the two are linked and often interdependent, and 'modernization' does not come as a whole.

Modernization theory has also been accused of being [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], as modernization began in Europe, with the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (Macionis 953) and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe. Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further and say that the view is ethnocentric and is specific to [[Western culture]].

===Dependency theory===
One alternative model on the left is [[Dependency theory]]. It emerged in the 1950s and argues that the underdevelopment of poor nations in the Third World derived from systematic imperial and neo-colonial exploitation of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Abhijeet Paul, "Dependency theory." in John Mackenzie, ed.   ''The Encyclopedia of Empire'' (2016) {{doi|10.1002/9781118455074.wbeoe242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its proponents argue that resources typically flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theorists such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, and Barry K. Gills, eds. ''Andre Gunder Frank and global development: visions, remembrances, and explorations'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency models arose from a growing association of southern hemisphere nationalists (from Latin America and Africa) and Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Smith,  "The underdevelopment of development literature: the case of dependency theory." ''World Politics'' 31#2 (1979): 247–88.&lt;/ref&gt; It was their reaction against modernization theory, which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm |date=2009-07-14 }}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">'''Molecular cellular cognition''' ('''MCC''') is a branch of  [[neuroscience]] that involves the study of cognitive processes with approaches that integrate molecular, cellular and behavioral mechanisms. Key goals of MCC studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes, as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for [[cognitive disorder]]s.

Although closely connected with [[behavioral genetics]], MCC emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behavior, instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior.

Unlike [[cognitive neuroscience]], which historically has focused on the connection between [[human brain]] systems and behavior, the field of MCC has used model organisms, such as mice, to study how molecular (i.e. receptor, [[kinase]] activation, [[phosphatase]] regulation), intra-cellular (i.e. [[Dendrite|dendritic]] processes), and inter-cellular processes (i.e. [[synaptic plasticity]]; network representations such as place fields) modulate cognitive function.

Methods employed in MCC include (but are not limited to) [[transgenic organism]]s (i.e. mice), [[viral vector]]s, [[pharmacology]], ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' [[electrophysiology]], [[optogenetics]], ''in vivo'' imaging, and behavioral analysis. Modeling is becoming an essential component of the field because of the complexity of the multilevel data generated.

==Scientific roots==
The field of MCC has its roots in the pioneering pharmacological studies of the role of [[NMDA receptor]] in [[long-term potentiation]] and [[spatial learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris RG, Anderson E, Lynch GS, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411 |doi=10.1038/319774a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v319/n6056/abs/319774a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in studies that used [[Knockout mouse|knockout mice]] to look at the role of the [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|alpha calcium calmodulin kinase II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silva AJ, Paylor R, Wehner JM, Tonegawa S |title=Impaired spatial learning in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=206–11 |year=1992 |pmid=1321493 |doi= 10.1126/science.1321493|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silva AJ, Stevens CF, Tonegawa S, Wang Y |title=Deficient hippocampal long-term potentiation in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=201–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1378648 |doi= 10.1126/science.1378648|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/257/5067/201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FYN]] kinase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant SG, O'Dell TJ, Karl KA, Stein PL, Soriano P, Kandel ER |title=Impaired long-term potentiation, spatial learning, and hippocampal development in fyn mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=258 |issue=5090 |pages=1903–10 |year=1992 |pmid=1361685 |doi= 10.1126/science.1361685|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/258/5090/1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] long-term potentiation and spatial learning. The field has since expanded to include a large array of molecules including [[CREB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Silva AJ |title=Molecular and cellular cognitive studies of the role of synaptic plasticity in memory |journal=J. Neurobiol. |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=224–37 |year=2003 |pmid=12486706 |doi=10.1002/neu.10169 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/101526010/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of the field==
MCC became an organized field with the formation of the [[Molecular Cellular Cognition Society]], an organization with no membership fees and meetings that emphasize the participation of junior scientists. Its first meeting took place in Orlando, Florida on November first, 2002. {{As of|2012}}, the society had organized numerous meetings in North America, Europe, and Asia, and included more than 4000 members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The office of the '''Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression''' of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) was established by the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) in 1997 to monitor OAS member states' compliance with the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] in the area of [[freedom of expression]]. 

The office analyses complaints of free expression violations received by the IACHR and advises the Commission on cases, including requests for "precautionary measures" from OAS member states to protect [[journalists]] and others who face threats or the risk of irreparable harm.

In cases involving a serious violation of freedom of expression, the Special Rapporteur issues press releases about the information it has received, expresses its concern to the authorities, and makes recommendations for re-instating this right. In other cases, the special rapporteur directly contacts government authorities to obtain further information and/or to request that the government take measures to rectify the harm that has been inflicted.

The special rapporteur also makes recommendations to OAS member states to reform laws and regulations that violate free expression rights guaranteed under the Convention. 

The special rapporteur participates in education, training and other activities to promote the right to freedom of expression and support local journalists and [[human rights defenders]], and conducts fact-finding missions to investigate reports of abuses in OAS member states. 

Each year, the rapporteur issues an annual report detailing the state of press freedom and freedom of expression in each country in the Americas. 

The OAS Rapporteur is one of the four International Mechanisms for Promoting Freedom of Expression, the others being the [[UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression]], the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and the [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media]]. Each year, they issue a joint declaration calling attention to worldwide free expression concerns.[http://www.cidh.oas.org/relatoria/docListCat.asp?catID=16&amp;lID=1]

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

==History of orphan genes==
Orphan genes were first discovered when the yeast genome-sequencing project began in 1996.&lt;ref name="Tautz"/&gt; Orphan genes accounted for an estimated 26% of the yeast genome, but it was believed that these genes could be classified with homologues when more genomes were sequenced.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; At the time, gene duplication was considered the only serious model of gene evolution&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=F.|date=1977-06-10|title=Evolution and tinkering|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/196/4295/1161|journal=Science|language=en|volume=196|issue=4295|pages=1161–1166|doi=10.1126/science.860134|pmid=860134|bibcode=1977Sci...196.1161J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were few sequenced genomes for comparison, so a lack of detectable homologues was thought to be most likely due to a lack of sequencing data and not due to a true lack of homology.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, orphan genes continued to persist as the quantity of sequenced genomes grew,&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = G.

The study of orphan genes emerged largely after the turn of the century. In 2003, a study of ''[[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]'' and related species compared over 2000 genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; They proposed that these genes must be evolving too quickly to be detected and are consequently sites of very rapid evolution.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt;  In 2005, Wilson examined 122 bacterial species to try to examine whether the large number of orphan genes in many species was legitimate.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; The study found that it was legitimate and played a role in bacterial adaptation. The definition of taxonomically-restricted genes was introduced into the literature to make orphan genes seem less "mysterious."&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

In 2008, a yeast protein of established functionality, BSC4, was found to have evolved de novo from non-coding sequences whose homology was still detectable in sister species.&lt;ref name="Cai 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Jing|last2=Zhao|first2=Ruoping|last3=Jiang|first3=Huifeng|last4=Wang|first4=Wen|date=2008-05-01|title=De Novo Origination of a New Protein-Coding Gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/179/1/487|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=179|issue=1|pages=487–496|doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084491|pmc=2390625|pmid=18493065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an orphan gene was discovered to regulate an internal biological network:  the orphan gene, QQS, from ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' modifies plant composition.&lt;ref name="Foster, C. M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = L. | last2 = Foster | first2 = C. M. | last3 = Gan | first3 = Q. | last4 = Nettleton | first4 = D. | last5 = James | first5 = M.

==How to identify orphan genes==
Genes can be tentatively classified as orphans if no orthologous proteins can be found in nearby species.&lt;ref name="Wissler"/&gt;

One method used to estimate nucleotide or protein sequence similarity indicative of homology (i.e. similarity due to common origin) is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). BLAST allows query sequences to be rapidly searched against large sequence databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschul|first1=S.|title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 September 1997|volume=25|issue=17|pages=3389–3402|doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|pmid=9254694|pmc=146917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCBI BLAST homepage|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations suggest that under certain conditions BLAST is suitable for detecting distant relatives of a gene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alba|first1=M|last2=Castresana|first2=J|title=On homology searches by protein BLAST and the characterization of the age of genes|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|date=2007|volume=7|page=53|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-53 |pmid=17408474|pmc=1855329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genes that are short and evolve rapidly can easily be missed by BLAST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moyers|first1=B. A.|last2=Zhang|first2=J.|title=Phylostratigraphic Bias Creates Spurious Patterns of Genome Evolution|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=13 October 2014|volume=32|issue=1|pages=258–267|doi=10.1093/molbev/msu286|pmid=25312911|pmc=4271527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic detection of homology to annotate orphan genes is called phylostratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A phylostratigraphy approach to uncover the genomic history of major adaptations in metazoan lineages|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S0168952507002995/abstract|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2007-01-11|pmid = 18029048|pages = 533–539|volume = 23|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.08.014|first = Tomislav|last = Domazet-Lošo|first2 = Josip|last2 = Brajković|first3 = Diethard|last3 = Tautz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylostratigraphy generates a phylogenetic tree in which the homology is calculated between all genes of a focal species and the genes of other species. The earliest common ancestor for a gene determines the age, or phylostratum, of the gene. The term "orphan" is sometimes used only for the youngest phylostratum containing only a single species, but when interpreted broadly as a taxonomically-restricted gene, it can refer to all but the oldest phylostratum, with the gene orphaned within a larger clade.

==Where do orphan genes come from?==
Orphan genes arise from multiple sources, predominantly through de novo origination, duplication and rapid divergence, and horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;

=== De Novo Origination ===
Novel orphan genes continually arise de novo from non-coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLysaght|first1=Aoife|last2=Guerzoni|first2=Daniele|title=New genes from non-coding sequence: the role of de novo protein-coding genes in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=31 August 2015|volume=370|issue=1678|pages=20140332|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0332|pmid=26323763|pmc=4571571}}&lt;/ref&gt; These novel genes may be sufficiently beneficial to be swept to fixation by selection. Or, more likely, they will fade back into the non-genic background. This latter option is supported by research in Drosophila showing that young genes are more likely go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmieri|first1=Nicola|last2=Kosiol|first2=Carolin|last3=Schlötterer|first3=Christian|title=The life cycle of orphan genes|journal=eLife|date=19 February 2014|volume=3|pages=e01311|doi=10.7554/eLife.01311|pmid=24554240|pmc=3927632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De novo genes were once thought to be a near impossibility due to the complex and potentially fragile intricacies of creating and maintaining functional polypeptides,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but research from the past 10 years or so has found multiple examples of de novo genes, some of which are associated with important biological processes, particularly testes function in animals.

For young orphan genes, it is sometimes possible to find homologous non-coding DNA sequences in sister taxa, which is generally accepted as strong evidence of de novo origin. However, the contribution of de novo origination to taxonomically-restricted genes of older origin, particularly in relation to the traditional gene duplication theory of gene evolution, remains contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neme|first=Rafik|last2=Tautz|first2=Diethard|date=2014-03-17|title=Evolution: Dynamics of De Novo Gene Emergence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214001547|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=6|pages=R238–R240|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.02.016|pmid=24650912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyers|first=Bryan A.|last2=Zhang|first2=Jianzhi|date=2016-01-11|title=Evaluating phylostratigraphic evidence for widespread de novo gene birth in genome evolution|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/01/11/molbev.msw008|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|pages=1245–56|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw008|pmc=5010002| pmid=26758516|volume=33|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duplication and Divergence ===
The duplication and divergence model for orphan genes involves a new gene being created from some duplication or divergence event and undergoing a period of rapid evolution where all detectable similarity to the originally duplicated gene is lost.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; While this explanation is consistent with current understandings of duplication mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; the number of mutations needed to lose detectable similarity is large enough as to be a rare event,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the evolutionary mechanism by which a gene duplicate could be sequestered and diverge so rapidly remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The altered evolutionary trajectories of gene duplicates|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2004-11-01|pmid = 15475113|pages = 544–549|volume = 20|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2004.09.001|first = Michael|last = Lynch|first2 = Vaishali|last2 = Katju|citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal Gene Transfer ===
Another explanation for how orphan genes arise is through a duplication mechanism called [[horizontal gene transfer]], where the original duplicated gene derives from a separate, unknown lineage.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; This explanation for the origin of orphan genes is especially relevant in bacteria and archaea, where horizontal gene transfer is common.

Orphans genes tend to be very short (~6 times shorter than mature genes), and some are weakly expressed, tissue specific and simpler in codon usage and amino acid composition.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendsee|first1=Zebulun W.|last2=Li|first2=Ling|last3=Wurtele|first3=Eve Syrkin|title=Coming of age: orphan genes in plants|journal=Trends in Plant Science|date=November 2014|volume=19|issue=11|pages=698–708|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2014.07.003|pmid=25151064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan genes tend to encode more [[intrinsically disordered proteins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukherjee|first1=S.|last2=Panda|first2=A.|last3=Ghosh|first3=T.C.|title=Elucidating evolutionary features and functional implications of orphan genes in ''Leishmania major''|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|date=June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.031|pmid=25843649|volume=32 |pages=330–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Benjamin A.|last2=Foy|first2=Scott G.|last3=Neme |first3=Rafik |last4=Masel|first4=Joanna |author4link=Joanna Masel|title=Young genes are highly disordered as predicted by the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene birth |journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=24 April 2017|volume=1|issue=6|pages=0146|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0146|pmid=28642936|pmc=5476217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="willis_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willis |first1=Sara |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Gene Birth Contributes to Structural Disorder Encoded by Overlapping Genes |journal=Genetics |date=19 July 2018 |volume=210 |issue=1 |pages=303–313 |doi=10.1534/genetics.118.301249 |pmid=30026186 |pmc=6116962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, although some structure has been found in one of the best characterized orphan genes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bungard |first1=Dixie |last2=Copple |first2=Jacob S. |last3=Yan |first3=Jing |last4=Chhun |first4=Jimmy J. |last5=Kumirov |first5=Vlad K. |last6=Foy |first6=Scott G. |last7=Masel |first7=Joanna |last8=Wysocki |first8=Vicki H. |last9=Cordes |first9=Matthew H.J. |title=Foldability of a Natural De Novo Evolved Protein |journal=Structure |date=November 2017 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=1687–1696.e4 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2017.09.006|pmid=29033289 |pmc=5677532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Of the tens of thousands of enzymes of primary or specialized metabolism that have been characterized to date, none are orphans, or even of restricted lineage; apparently, catalysis requires hundreds of millions of years of evolution.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"/&gt;

==Biological functions==
While the prevalence of orphan genes has been established, the evolutionary role of orphans, and its resulting importance, is still being debated. One theory is that many orphans have no evolutionary role; genomes contain non-functional open reading frames (ORFs) that create spurious polypeptide products not maintained by selection, meaning that they are unlikely to be conserved between species and would likely be detected as orphan genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, a variety of other studies have shown that at least some orphans are functionally important and may help explain the emergence of novel phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster, C. M. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donoghue" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16737">In [[differential geometry]] and [[theoretical physics]], the '''Petrov classification''' (also known as Petrov–Pirani–Penrose classification) describes the possible algebraic [[symmetry|symmetries]] of the [[Weyl tensor]] at each [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]] in a [[Lorentzian manifold]].

It is most often applied in studying [[exact solutions]] of [[Einstein's field equations]], but strictly speaking the classification is a theorem in pure mathematics applying to any Lorentzian manifold, independent of any physical interpretation. The classification was found in 1954 by [[A. Z. Petrov]] and independently by [[Felix Pirani]] in 1957.

==Classification theorem==
We can think of a fourth [[Tensor#Tensor rank|rank]] [[tensor]] such as the [[Weyl tensor]], ''evaluated at some event'', as acting on the space of [[bivector]]s at that event like a [[linear operator]] acting on a vector space:

:&lt;math&gt; X^{ab} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \, {C^{ab}}_{mn} X^{mn} &lt;/math&gt;

Then, it is natural to consider the problem of finding [[eigenvalues]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and [[eigenvectors]] (which are now referred to as eigenbivectors) &lt;math&gt;X^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \, {C^{ab}}_{mn} \, X^{mn} = \lambda \, X^{ab} &lt;/math&gt;

In (four-dimensional) Lorentzian spacetimes, there is a six-dimensional space of antisymmetric bivectors at each event.  However, the symmetries of the Weyl tensor imply that any eigenbivectors must belong to a four-dimensional subset.
Thus, the Weyl tensor (at a given event) can in fact have ''at most four'' linearly independent eigenbivectors.

Just as in the theory of the eigenvectors of an ordinary linear operator, the eigenbivectors of the Weyl tensor can occur with various [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]].  Just as in the case of ordinary linear operators, any multiplicities among the eigenbivectors indicates a kind of ''algebraic symmetry'' of the Weyl tensor at the given event.  Just as you would expect from the theory of the eigenvalues of an ordinary linear operator on a four-dimensional vector space, the different types of Weyl tensor (at a given event) can be determined by solving a [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]], in this case a [[quartic equation]].

These eigenbivectors are associated with certain [[null vector]]s in the original spacetime, which are called the '''principal null directions''' (at a given event).
The relevant [[multilinear algebra]] is somewhat involved (see the citations below), but the resulting classification theorem states that there are precisely six possible types of algebraic symmetry.  These are known as the '''Petrov types''':

[[Image:Petrov.png|frame|right|The ''Penrose diagram'' showing the possible degenerations of the Petrov type of the Weyl tensor]]

*'''Type I''': four simple principal null directions,
*'''Type II''': one double and two simple principal null directions,
*'''Type D''': two double principal null directions,
*'''Type III''': one triple and one simple principal null direction,
*'''Type N''': one quadruple principal null direction,
*'''Type O''': the Weyl tensor vanishes.

The possible transitions between Petrov types are shown in the figure, which can also be interpreted as stating that some of the Petrov types are "more special" than others.  For example, type '''I''', the most general type, can ''degenerate'' to types '''II''' or '''D''', while type '''II''' can degenerate to types '''III''', '''N''', or '''D'''.

Different events in a given spacetime can have different Petrov types.  A Weyl tensor that has type '''I''' (at some event) is called '''algebraically general'''; otherwise, it is called '''algebraically special''' (at that event).  Type '''O''' spacetimes are said to be '''[[conformally flat]]'''.

==Newman–Penrose formalism==

The [[Newman–Penrose formalism]] is often used in practice for the classification.  Consider the following set of bivectors:

:&lt;math&gt;U_{ab}=-l_{[a}m_{b]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{ab}=n_{[a}m_{b]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W_{ab}=m_{[a}\bar{m}_{b]}-n_{[a}l_{b]}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Weyl tensor can be expressed as a combination of these bivectors through

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}C_{abcd}&amp;= \Psi_0U_{ab}U_{cd} \\
&amp;\, \, \, +\Psi_1(U_{ab}W_{cd}+W_{ab}U_{cd}) \\
&amp;\, \, \, +\Psi_2(V_{ab}U_{cd}+U_{ab}V_{cd}+W_{ab}W_{cd}) \\
&amp;\, \, \, +\Psi_3(V_{ab}W_{cd}+W_{ab}V_{cd}) \\
&amp;\, \, \, +\Psi_4V_{ab}V_{cd}+c.c.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\{\Psi_j\}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Weyl scalar]]s and c.c. is the complex conjugate.  The six different Petrov types are distinguished by which of the Weyl scalars vanish.  The conditions are

*'''Type I'''  : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=0&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''Type II''' : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=\Psi_1=0&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''Type D'''  : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=\Psi_1=\Psi_3=\Psi_4=0&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''Type III''' : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=\Psi_1=\Psi_2=0&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''Type N'''  : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=\Psi_1=\Psi_2=\Psi_3=0&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''Type O'''  : &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0=\Psi_1=\Psi_2=\Psi_3=\Psi_4=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bel criteria==
Given a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on a Lorentzian manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the Weyl tensor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; for this metric may be computed. If the Weyl tensor is ''algebraically special'' at some &lt;math&gt;p \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a useful set of conditions, found by Lluis&lt;!--sic--&gt; (or Louis) Bel and Robert Debever,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Ortaggio_M/0/1/0/all/0/1 Marcello Ortaggio (2009), ''Bel-Debever criteria for the classification of the Weyl tensors in higher dimensions.'']&lt;/ref&gt; for determining precisely the Petrov type at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Denoting the Weyl tensor components at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; (assumed non-zero, i.e., not of type '''O'''), the '''Bel criteria''' may be stated as:

* &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is type '''N''' if and only if there exists a vector &lt;math&gt;k(p)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd} \, k^d =0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).

* If &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not type N''', then &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is of type '''III''' if and only if there exists a vector &lt;math&gt;k(p)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}\, k^bk^d=0= {^*C}_{abcd}\, k^bk^d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).

* &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is of type '''II''' if and only if there exists a vector &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}\, k^bk^d=\alpha k_ak_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{}^*C_{abcd}\, k^bk^d=\beta k_ak_c&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\alpha \beta \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;)

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).

* &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is of type '''D''' if and only if there exists ''two linearly independent vectors'' &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k'&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the conditions

:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}\, k^bk^d=\alpha k_ak_c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^*C_{abcd}\, k^bk^d=\beta k_ak_c&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\alpha \beta \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;)

and

:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}\, k'^bk'^d=\gamma k'_ak'_c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^*C_{abcd}\, k'^bk'^d=\delta k'_ak'_c&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\gamma \delta \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;).

where &lt;math&gt;{{}^*C}_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the dual of the Weyl tensor at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, for each criterion above, there are equivalent conditions for the Weyl tensor to have that type. These equivalent conditions are stated in terms of the dual and self-dual of the Weyl tensor and certain bivectors and are collected together in Hall (2004).

The Bel criteria find application in general relativity where determining the Petrov type of algebraically special Weyl tensors is accomplished by searching for null vectors.

==Physical interpretation==
According to [[general relativity]], the various algebraically special Petrov types have some interesting physical interpretations, the classification then sometimes being called the '''classification of gravitational fields'''.

'''Type D''' regions are associated with the gravitational fields of isolated massive objects, such as stars.  More precisely, type '''D''' fields occur as the field of a gravitating object which is completely characterized by its mass and angular momentum.  (A more general object might have nonzero higher [[multipole moments]].)  The two double principal null directions define "radially" ingoing and outgoing [[null congruence]]s near the object which is the source of the field.

The [[electrogravitic tensor]] (or ''tidal tensor'') in a type '''D''' region is very closely analogous to the gravitational fields which are described in [[Newtonian gravity]] by a [[Coulomb]] type [[gravitational potential]].  Such a tidal field is characterized by ''tension'' in one direction and ''compression'' in the orthogonal directions; the eigenvalues have the pattern (-2,1,1).  For example, a spacecraft orbiting the Earth experiences a tiny tension along a radius from the center of the Earth, and a tiny compression in the orthogonal directions.  Just as in Newtonian gravitation, this tidal field typically decays like &lt;math&gt;O(r^{-3})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the object.

If the object is rotating about some [[axis of rotation|axis]], in addition to the tidal effects, there will be various [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] effects, such as [[spin-spin forces]] on [[gyroscopes]] carried by an observer.  In the [[Kerr metric|Kerr vacuum]], which is the best known example of type '''D''' vacuum solution, this part of the field decays like &lt;math&gt;O(r^{-4})&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Type III''' regions are associated with a kind of [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] gravitational radiation.  In such regions, the tidal forces have a [[Shear (fluid)|shearing]] effect.  This possibility is often neglected, in part because the gravitational radiation which arises in [[Weak-field approximation|weak-field theory]] is type '''N''', and in part because type '''III''' radiation decays like &lt;math&gt;O(r^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;, which is faster than type '''N''' radiation.

'''Type N''' regions are associated with [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] gravitational radiation, which is the type astronomers have detected with [[LIGO]].
The quadruple principal null direction corresponds to the [[wave vector]] describing the direction of propagation of this radiation.  It typically decays like &lt;math&gt;O(r^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, so the long-range radiation field is type '''N'''.

'''Type II''' regions combine the effects noted above for types '''D''', '''III''', and '''N''', in a rather complicated nonlinear way.

'''Type O''' regions, or [[conformally flat]] regions, are associated with places where the Weyl tensor vanishes identically.  In this case, the curvature is said to be ''pure [[Ricci tensor|Ricci]]''.  In a conformally flat region, any gravitational effects must be due to the immediate presence of matter or the [[classical field theory|field]] [[energy]] of some nongravitational field (such as an [[electromagnetic field]]).  In a sense, this means that any distant objects are not exerting any [[long range influence]] on events in our region.  More precisely, if there are any time varying gravitational fields in distant regions, the [[news function|news]] has not yet reached our conformally flat region.

[[Gravitational radiation]] emitted from an isolated system will usually not be algebraically special.
The [[peeling theorem]] describes the way in which, as one moves farther way from the source of the radiation, the various components of the [[radiation field]] "peel" off, until finally only type '''N''' radiation is noticeable at large distances. This is similar to the [[electromagnetic peeling theorem]].

==Examples==
In some (more or less) familiar solutions, the Weyl tensor has the same Petrov type at each event:
*the [[Kerr metric|Kerr vacuum]] is everywhere type '''D''',
*certain [[Robinson/Trautman spacetimes|Robinson/Trautman vacuums]] are everywhere type '''III''',
*the [[pp-wave spacetimes]] are everywhere type '''N''',
*the [[Robertson–Walker metric|FRW models]] are everywhere type '''O'''.

More generally, any [[spherically symmetric spacetime]] must be of type '''D''' (or '''O''').  All algebraically special spacetimes having various types of [[stress–energy tensor]] are known, for example, all the type '''D''' vacuum solutions.

Some classes of solutions can be invariantly characterized using algebraic symmetries of the Weyl tensor: for example, the class of non-conformally flat null [[electrovacuum solution|electrovacuum]] or [[null dust solution|null dust]] solutions admitting an expanding but nontwisting null congruence is precisely the class of ''Robinson/Trautmann spacetimes''.  These are usually type '''II''', but include type '''III''' and type '''N''' examples.

==Generalization to higher dimensions==
A. Coley, R. Milson, V. Pravda and A. Pravdová (2004) developed a generalization of algebraic classification to arbitrary spacetime dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  Their approach uses a null [[vielbein|frame basis]] approach, that is a frame basis containing two null vectors &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, along with &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; spacelike vectors.  Frame basis components of the [[Weyl tensor]] are classified by their transformation properties under local [[Lorentz transformations|Lorentz boosts]].  If particular Weyl components vanish, then &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''Weyl-Aligned Null Directions''' (WANDs).  In four dimensions, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is a WAND if and only if it is a principal null direction in the sense defined above.  This approach gives a natural higher-dimensional extension of each of the various algebraic types '''II''','''D''' etc. defined above.

An alternative, but inequivalent, generalization was previously defined by de&amp;nbsp;Smet (2002), based on a [[Spinors|spinorial approach]]. However, de&amp;nbsp;Smet's approach is restricted to 5 dimensions only.

A phenomenological model foregoes any attempt to explain why the variables interact the way they do, and simply attempts to describe the relationship, with the assumption that the relationship extends past the measured values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilborn|first1=Ray|last2=Mangel|first2=Marc|title=The Ecological Detective Confronting Models with Data (MPB-28).|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400847310|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}} [[Regression analysis]] is sometimes used to create [[statistical model]]s that serve as phenomenological models.

Certain aspects of these theories—though usually not the complete theory—are then used to determine both the static and dynamical properties of the nucleus.

'''Physical computing''' means building interactive [[physical system]]s by the use of [[software]] and hardware that can sense and respond to the [[analog signal|analog]] world.{{clarify|reason=If there is any distinction from an embedded system, mention it here.|date=September 2016}} While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic [[control system]]s or factory [[automation]] processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the [[Digital data|digital]] world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or [[DIY]] hobby projects that use [[sensor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s to translate analog input to a [[software system]], and/or control [[electro-mechanical]] devices such as [[Electric motor|motor]]s, [[Servomechanism|servo]]s, [[lighting]] or other hardware.

Physical Computing intersects the range of activities often referred to in academia and industry as electrical engineering, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, and especially [[Embedded system|embedded development.]]

== Examples ==

Physical computing is used in a wide variety of domains and applications.

===In Education===
The advantage of physicality in education and playfulness has been reflected in diverse informal learning environments. The [[Exploratorium]], a pioneer in [[inquiry based learning]], developed some of the earliest interactive exhibitry involving computers, and continues to include more and more examples of physical computing and [[tangible interface]]s as associated technologies progress.

===In Art===
In the art world, projects that implement physical computing include the work of [[Scott Snibbe]], [[Daniel Rozin]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[Jonah Brucker-Cohen]], [[Camille Utterback]], [[Virtual Reality]] VR/shyam, [[Augmented Reality]] AR/hiren, and Electroland [[LED art]].

===In Product Design===
Physical computing practices also exist in the product and interaction design sphere, where hand-built [[embedded system]]s are sometimes used to rapidly prototype new digital product concepts in a cost-efficient way. Firms such as [[IDEO]] and [[Teague (company)|Teague]] are known to approach [[product design]] in this way.

===In Commercial Applications===
Commercial implementations range from consumer devices such as the [[Sony Eyetoy]] or games such as [[Dance Dance Revolution]] to more esoteric and pragmatic uses including [[machine vision]] utilized in the automation of quality inspection along a factory [[assembly line]]. [[Exergaming]] can be considered a form of physical computing. Other implementations of physical computing include [[speech recognition|voice recognition]], which senses and interprets sound waves via microphones or other soundwave sensing devices, and [[computer vision]], which applies algorithms to a rich stream of [[video]] data typically sensed by some form of camera. [[Haptic technology|Haptic]] interfaces are also an example of physical computing, though in this case the computer is ''generating'' the physical stimulus as opposed to ''sensing'' it. Both [[motion capture]] and [[gesture recognition]] are fields that rely on computer vision to work their magic.

===In Scientific Applications===
Physical computing can also describe the fabrication and use of custom sensors or collectors for scientific experiments, though the term is rarely used to describe them as such. An example of physical computing modeling is the ''[[Illustris project]]'', which attempts to precisely simulate the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]] from the [[Big Bang]] to the present day, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years]] later.&lt;ref name="IP-20140614"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=The Illustris Simulation - Towards a predictive theory of galaxy formation. |url=http://www.illustris-project.org/ |date=14 June 2014 |work=[http://www.illustris-project.org Illustris Project] |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20140514"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogelsberger, Mark |author2=Genel, Shy |author3=Springel, Volker |author4=Torrey, Paul |author5=Sijacki, Debora |author6=Xu, Dandan |author7=Snyder, Greg |author8=Nelson, Dylan |author9=Hernquist, Lars |title=Introducing the Illustris Project: Simulating the coevolution of dark and visible matter in the Universe |date=14 May 2014  |arxiv=1405.2921  |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu1536 |volume=444 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=1518–1547|bibcode=2014MNRAS.444.1518V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Prototyping plays an important role in Physical Computing. Tools like the [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]], [[Arduino]] and [[Fritzing]] as well as [[I-CubeX]] help designers and artists to quickly prototype their interactive concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">In [[mathematics]], the '''quasi-commutative property''' is an extension or generalization of the general [[commutative property]]. This property is used in specific applications with various definitions.

==Applied to matrices==

Two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ''p'' and ''q'' are said to have the [[commutative property]] whenever
:&lt;math&gt;pq = qp&lt;/math&gt;

The quasi-commutative property in matrices is defined&lt;ref name=McCoy&gt;Neal H. McCoy. [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1934-036-02/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8.pdf On quasi-commutative matrices. ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 36''(2), 327–340].&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Given two non-commutable matrices ''x'' and ''y''
:&lt;math&gt; xy - yx = z&lt;/math&gt;
satisfy the quasi-commutative property whenever ''z'' satisfies the following properties:
:&lt;math&gt; xz = zx &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; yz = zy &lt;/math&gt;

An example is found in the [[matrix mechanics]] introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] as a version of [[quantum mechanics]]. In this mechanics, ''p'' and ''q'' are infinite matrices corresponding respectively to the momentum and position variables of a particle.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; These matrices are written out at [[Matrix mechanics#Harmonic oscillator]], and z = iħ times the infinite [[Identity matrix|unit matrix]], where ħ is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

==Applied to functions==

A function ''f'', defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be quasi-commutative&lt;ref&gt;Benaloh, J., &amp; De Mare, M. (1994, January). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.13.8287&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf One-way accumulators: A decentralized alternative to digital signatures]. In ''Advances in Cryptology—EUROCRYPT’93'' (pp. 274–285). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; if for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2 \in Y&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(f(x,y_1),y_2) = f(f(x,y_2),y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Ressentiment''''' ({{IPA-fr|rɛsɑ̃timɑ̃}}) is the French translation of the English word [[resentment]] (from Latin intensive prefix ''re-'', and ''sentir'' "to feel"). In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] it is a concept that was of particular interest to the [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophers]]. According to the existentialists, ''ressentiment'' is a sense of  hostility directed at that which one identifies as the [[cause]] of one's [[frustration]], that is, an assignment of blame for one's frustration.  The sense of weakness or inferiority and perhaps [[jealousy]] in the face of the "cause" generates a rejecting/justifying value system, or [[morality]], which attacks or denies the perceived source of one's frustration. This value system is then used as a means of justifying one's own weaknesses by identifying the source of envy as objectively inferior, serving as a [[defense mechanism]] that prevents the resentful individual from addressing and overcoming their insecurities and flaws. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] creates an enemy in order to insulate itself from culpability.{{Citation Needed|date=June 2015}}

== History ==
''Ressentiment'' was first introduced as a philosophical/psychological term by the 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;Poole, Roger. ''Kierkegaard'', University of Virginia Press, 1993, pp. 226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stivers, Richard. ''Shades of loneliness'', Rowman &amp; Little Field o, 2004, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, John, et al. ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre'', Open Court , 2001, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] later [[Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche|independently]] expanded the concept; [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] ascribes Nietzsche's use of the term in part to the absence of a proper equivalent term in the [[German language]], contending that this absence alone "would be sufficient excuse for Nietzsche", if not for a translator.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, Walter]]. "Editor's Introduction, Section 3" ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' in ''Nietzsche: Basic Writings''; Walter Kaufmann, tr. New York: The Modern Library, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to form a key part of his ideas concerning the psychology of the '[[Master–slave morality|master–slave]]' question (articulated in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]''), and the resultant birth of [[morality]]. Nietzsche's chief development of ressentiment came in his book ''[[On The Genealogy of Morals]]''; see esp §§ 10&amp;ndash;11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anth/AnthMore.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20130628040813/http://www.nietzschecircle.com/essayArchive1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ressentiment'' was translated as [[envy]] in [[Howard V. Hong|Hong]]'s translation of Kierkegaard's ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see pages 81-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used by [[Max Scheler]] in his book ''[[Ressentiment (Scheler)|Ressentiment]]'', published in 1912, and later suppressed by the [[Nazis]].

Currently of great import as a term widely used in psychology and [[existentialism]], ressentiment is viewed as an influential force for the creation of identities, moral frameworks and value systems. However there is debate as to what validity these resultant value systems have, and to what extent they are maladaptive and destructive.

== Perspectives ==
===Hegel===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old conception—due to a one-sided survey of human life—of Nemesis, which made the divinity and its action in the world only a levelling power, dashing to pieces everything high and great,—was confronted by Plato and Aristotle with the doctrine that God is not envious. The same answer may be given to the modern assertions that man cannot ascertain God. These assertions (and more than assertions they are not) are the more illogical, because made within a religion which is expressly called the revealed; for according to them it would rather be the religion in which nothing of God was revealed, in which he had not revealed himself, and those belonging to it would be the heathen “who know not God.” If the word of God is taken in earnest in religion at all, it is from Him, the theme and centre of religion, that the method of divine knowledge may and must begin: and if self-revelation is refused Him, then the only thing left to constitute His nature would be to ascribe envy to Him. But clearly if the word Mind is to have a meaning, it implies the revelation of Him.&lt;br&gt;—''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'' by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1817), Section 564&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39064/39064-h/39064-h.html#toc39 Hegel's ''Philosophy of Mind'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a fundamental truth of human nature that man is incapable of remaining permanently on the heights, of continuing to admire anything. [[Human nature]] needs variety. Even in the most enthusiastic ages people have always liked to joke enviously about their superiors. That is perfectly in order and is entirely justifiable so long as after having laughed at the great they can once more look upon them with admiration; otherwise the game is not worth the candle. In that way ressentiment finds an outlet even in an enthusiastic age. And as long as an age, even though less enthusiastic, has the strength to give ''ressentiment'' its proper character and has made up its mind what its expression signifies, ressentiment has its own, though dangerous importance. …. the more reflection gets the upper hand and thus makes people indolent, the more dangerous ''ressentiment'' becomes, because it no longer has sufficient character to make it conscious of its significance. Bereft of that character reflection is a cowardly and vacillating, and according to circumstances interprets the same thing in a variety of way. It tries to treat it as a joke, and if that fails, to regard it as an insult, and when that fails, to dismiss it as nothing at all; or else it will treat the thing as a witticism, and if that fails then say that it was meant as a moral satire deserving attention, and if that does not succeed, add that it was not worth bothering about. …. ''ressentiment'' becomes the constituent principle of want of character, which from utter wretchedness tries to sneak itself a position, all the time safeguarding itself by conceding that it is less than nothing. The ''ressentiment'' which results from want of character can never understand that eminent distinction really is distinction. Neither does it understand itself by recognizing distinction negatively (as in the case of ostracism) but wants to drag it down, wants to belittle it so that it really ceases to be distinguished. And ''ressentiment'' not only defends itself against all existing forms of distinction but against that which is still to ''come''. …. The ''ressentiment'' which is ''establishing itself'' is the process of [[Leveling (philosophy)|leveling]], and while a passionate age storms ahead setting up new things and tearing down old, raising and demolishing as it goes, a reflective and passionless age does exactly the contrary; it ''hinders and stifles'' all action; it levels. Leveling is a silent, mathematical, and abstract occupation which shuns upheavals. In a burst of momentary enthusiasm people might, in their despondency, even long for a misfortune in order to feel the powers of life, but the apathy which follows is no more helped by a disturbance than an engineer leveling a piece of land. At its most violent a rebellion is like a volcanic eruption and drowns every other sound. At its maximum the leveling process is a deathly silence in which one can hear one’s own heart beat, a silence which nothing can pierce, in which everything is engulfed, powerless to resist. One man can be at the head a rebellion, but no one can be at the head of the leveling process alone, for in that case he would be leader and would thus escape being leveled. Each individual within his own little circle can co-operate in the leveling, but it is an abstract power, and the leveling process is the victory of abstraction over the individual. The leveling process in modern times, corresponds, in reflection, to fate in antiquity. ... It must be obvious to everyone that the profound significance of the leveling process lies in the fact that it means the predominance of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] ‘[[generation]]’ over the [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] ‘[[individuality]]’." —[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[Present age|The Present Age]]'' (Alexander Dru tr.), 1962, pp. 49–52&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(T)he problem with the other origin of the “good,” of the good man, as the person of ''ressentiment'' has thought it out for himself, demands some conclusion. It is not surprising that the lambs should bear a grudge against the great birds of prey, but that is no reason for blaming the great birds of prey for taking the little lambs. And when the lambs say among themselves, "These birds of prey are evil, and he who least resembles a bird of prey, who is rather its opposite, a lamb,—should he not be good?" then there is nothing to carp with in this ideal's establishment, though the birds of prey may regard it a little mockingly, and maybe say to themselves, "We bear no grudge against them, these good lambs, we even love them:  nothing is tastier than a tender lamb."&lt;br&gt;—[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Ressentiment'' is a reassignment of the pain that accompanies a sense of one's own inferiority/failure onto an external scapegoat. The ego creates the illusion of an enemy, a cause that can be "blamed" for one's own inferiority/failure. Thus, one was thwarted not by a failure in oneself, but rather by an external "evil."

According to Kierkegaard, ''ressentiment'' occurs in a "reflective, passionless age", in which the populace stifles creativity and passion in passionate individuals. Kierkegaard argues that individuals who do not conform to the masses are made scapegoats and objects of ridicule by the masses, in order to maintain status quo and to instill into the masses their own sense of superiority.

''Ressentiment'' comes from reactiveness: the weaker someone is, the less their capability to suppress reaction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''The Will to Power'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, the more a person is active, strong-willed, and dynamic, the less place and time is left for contemplating all that is done to them, and their reactions (like imagining they are actually better) become less compulsive. The reaction of a strong-willed person (a "wild beast"&lt;ref&gt;''On the Genealogy of Morality'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;), when it happens, is ideally a short action: it is not a prolonged filling of their intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Genealogy of Morality'', 10, last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scheler===
{{main|Ressentiment (Scheler)}}
[[Max Scheler]] attempted to reconcile Nietzsche's ideas of master–slave morality and ressentiment with the Christian ideals of love and humility. Nietzsche saw Christian morality as a kind of slave morality, while Greek and Roman culture was characterized as a master morality. Scheler [[Ressentiment_(Scheler)|disagrees]]. He begins with a comparison of Greek love and Christian love.  Greek love is described as a movement from lower value to higher value. The weaker love the stronger, the less perfect love the more perfect. The perfect do not love the imperfect because that would diminish their value or corrupt their existence. Greek love is rooted in need and want. This is clearly indicated by the Aristotelian concept of God as the "Unmoved Mover". The unmoved mover is self-sufficient being completely immersed in its own existence. The highest object of contemplation, and who moves others through the force of attraction because efficient causality would degrade its nature.

In Christian love, there is a reversal in the movement of love.  The strong bend to the weak, the healthy help the sick, the noble help the vulgar.  This movement is a consequence of the Christian understanding of the nature of God as fullness of being.  God's love is an expression of His superabundance.  The motive for love is not charity nor the neediness of the lover, but it is rooted in a deeply felt confidence that through loving I become more personalized and most real to myself.  The motive for the world is not need or lack (à la Schopenhauer), but a creative urge to express the infinite fullness of being.  Poverty and sickness are not values to be celebrated in order to spite those who are rich and healthy, but they simply provide the opportunity for a person to express his love.  Rich people are harder to love because they are less in need of your generosity.  Fear of death is a sign of a declining, sick, and  broken life (Ressent 60). St. Francis' love and care for the lepers would have mortified the Greek mind, but for St. Francis, the threats to well-being are inconsequential because at the core of his being there is the awareness that his existence is firmly rooted in and sustained by the ground of ultimate being.  In genuine, Christian love, the lower values that are relative to life are renounced not because they are bad, but simply because they are obstacles to those absolute values which allow a person to enter into a relationship with God.  It is through loving like God that we are deified.  This is why Scheler sees the Christian saint as a manifestation of strength and nobility and ''not'' manifesting ressentiment.

===Weber===

[[Max Weber]] in ''The Sociology of Religion'' relates ressentiment to Judaism, an ethical salvation religion of a "pariah people."  Weber defines ressentiment as "a concomitant of that particular religious ethic of the disprivileged which, in the sense expounded by Nietzsche and in direct inversion of the ancient belief, teaches that the unequal distribution of mundane goods is caused by the sinfulness and the illegality of the privileged, and that sooner or later God's wrath will overtake them."  (Max Weber,  ''The Sociology of Religion,''  (Boston: Beacon Press, 1993),  110.

===Sartre===

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] used the term [[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]] to describe a highly similar phenomenon of blaming one's own failure on external factors and therefore denying [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for oneself.

===Deleuze===

[[Gilles Deleuze]] significantly develops the concept of ressentiment as discussed by Nietzsche in his work ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]''.

=== Girard ===
[[René Girard]] differs from Nietzsche by assessing the ressentiment is a left-over of not pursuing the mimetic rival or the scapegoat. It is the price paid for turning the other cheek. [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] could be achieved only by moving beyond rivalry and ressentiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10934">'''Rule by decree''' is a style of governance allowing quick, unchallenged creation of law by a single person or group, and is used primarily by [[dictator]]s, [[absolute monarch]]s and [[military]] leaders.

The expression is also sometimes used when describing actions of democratic governments that are perceived to unduly bypass parliamentarian or popular scrutiny.

Rule by [[decree]] allows the ruler to arbitrarily create law, without approval by a [[legislative]] assembly.

When states of emergency such as [[martial law]] are in place, rule by decree is common. While rule by decree is easily susceptible to the whims and corruption of the person in power, it is also highly efficient: a law can take weeks or months to pass in a legislature, but can be created with the stroke of a pen by a leader ruling by decree. This is what makes it valuable in emergency situations. Thus, it is allowed by many [[constitutions]], among which is the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]], [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], etc.

==Lex Titia and Second Triumvirate==
One of the first examples of rule by decree was in the ancient [[Roman Republic]] when, after the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, his successor, Gaius Octavian ([[Augustus]]), general [[Mark Antony]] and succeeding [[pontifex maximus]] [[Aemilius Lepidus]] seized power in the [[Second Triumvirate]], officially recognized by the [[roman senate|senate]] by the [[Lex Titia]] decree. The resolution, which gave the three 'triumvirs' authoritarian powers for five years, was enacted and reinstated consecutive in 38 BC. It finally collapsed in 33/32 BC, after the downfall of Lepidus, leading to the [[Final war of the Roman Republic]] and the total collapse of republican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancient.eu/Second_Triumvirate/ |title=Second Triumvirate |last=Wasson |first=Donald L. |date=18 April 2016 |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February 1933==
The most prominent example in history is the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|German President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was convinced by [[Adolf Hitler]] to issue a decree suspending basic civil rights indefinitely.  As a result of this decree, [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities were able to constitutionally suppress or imprison their opposition, which in turn paved the way for the one-party rule of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/reichstag-fire-decree |title=Reichstag Fire Decree |last= |first= |date= |website=ushmm.org |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[State of emergency|state of exception]], which suspended the Constitution without repealing it, lasted until the end of the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ay-e-kad-o-lu/coup-d-tat-attempt-turkey-s-reichstag-fire |title=Coup d'état attempt: Turkey’s Reichstag fire? |last=Kadıoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=16 July 2016 |website=opendemocracy.net |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Decrees in non-dictatorial regimes==
Some democratic leaders, such as the presidents of [[President of Mexico|Mexico]], [[President of France|France]] and [[President of Argentina|Argentina]] may rule by decree in national emergencies, subject to constitutional and other legal limitations. In the case of France this power has been used only once, by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1961 during the [[Algerian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/history/france/france/20th/1958.htm |title=France in 1958 |last= |first= |date=22 June 2016 |website=robinsonlibrary.com |publisher=The Robinson Library |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern political concepts, such as the French [[decree]]s, [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] in the British Commonwealth and American [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s are partially based on this notion of decrees, although they are far more limited in scope and generally subject to [[judicial review]].

===India===
During the [[Indian Emergency]] from 1975 to 1977, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] had laws passed that allowed her to rule by decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/specials/in-depth/the-emergency-imposed-by-indira-gandhi-government/article7357305.ece |title=Emergency: The Dark Age of Indian democracy |last= |first= |date=27 June 2015 |website=thehindu.com |publisher=The Hindu |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Ireland's [[Emergency Powers Act 1939|Emergency Powers Act]] allows the government to rule by decrees called ''Emergency Powers Orders'' in any aspect of national life, if the [[Oireachtas|parliament]] invokes the emergency clause in Article 28(3) of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]].  The Act however allows the [[Dáil Éireann|lower house]] to void specific EPOs in a free vote or end the state of emergency at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/28/enacted/en/print.html |title=Emergency Powers Act, 1939 |last= |first= |date=3 September 1939 |website=irishstatutebook.ie |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
From 23 September&lt;ref&gt;[[s:ru:Указ Президента РФ от 21.09.1993 № 1400|
Russian presidential decree №1400]] '''(in Russian)'''&lt;/ref&gt; (given actual effect from 4 October after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|armed disbanding]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]]) to 12 December 1993, rule by decree ([[ukase]]s) was imposed in [[Russia]] by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], during transition from the [[Russian Constitution of 1978]] (which was modelled after the obsolete [[Soviet Constitution of 1977]]) to the [[Constitution of Russia|current 1993 Constitution]].

===Venezuela===
[[Venezuela]]n [[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] was granted executive power by the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] to rule by decree multiple times throughout his tenure, passing hundreds of laws. Chávez ruled Venezuela by decree in 2000,&lt;ref name="DAILY"&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela grants Chavez power to rule by decree|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Venezuela-grants-Chavez-power-to-rule-by-decree-/-/1068/1074822/-/view/printVersion/-/h2nxp5z/-/index.html|accessdate=12 May 2016|agency=''[[Daily Nation]]''|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001,&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt; 2004,&lt;ref name="GUARDfamily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=A family affair|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/06/chavez-family-venezuela|accessdate=12 May 2016|agency=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005,&lt;ref name="GUARDfamily"/&gt; 2006,&lt;ref name="GUARDfamily"/&gt; 2007,&lt;ref name="BBCchavezDECREE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rule by decree passed for Chavez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6277379.stm|accessdate=12 May 2016|agency=[[BBC News]]|date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008,&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCchavezDECREE"/&gt; 2010,&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNdecree"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hugo Chavez Fast Facts|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/11/world/americas/hugo-chavez---fast-facts/|accessdate=12 May 2016|agency=[[CNN]]|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNdecree"/&gt; and 2012.&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNdecree"/&gt; Between 2004 and 2006 alone, Chávez declared 18 "emergencies" to rule by decree.&lt;ref name="GUARDfamily"/&gt;

==Giorgio Agamben's critique of the use of decrees-law==
Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] has claimed that there has been an explosion in the use of various types of decrees (decree-law, presidential decrees, executive orders, etc.) since [[World War I]]. According to him, this is the sign of a "generalization of the [[state of exception]]".

'''Short shackling''' is a technique that [[United States|American]] [[interrogator]]s have been reported to use in the [[War on Terror]]. According to a military report the suspect's hands are [[shackle]]d to an [[eyebolt]] on the floor, so that the suspect is forced to lie in a [[fetal position]] or [[squatting position]].&lt;ref name="CSHRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/testimonies/testimony-of-the-department-of-justice/observations-regarding-specific-techniques/b-prolonged-shackling-and-stress-positions|title=Prolonged Shackling and Stress Positions|publisher=[[The Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas]]|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the suspect's feet are also bound to the eyebolt, similar to [[Hogtie|hogtying]], but this has not been confirmed in any government reports. This [[interrogation]] technique can cause flesh wounds.

In biology, a '''species complex''' is a group of closely related [[species]] that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: '''cryptic species''' for two or more species hidden under one species name, '''sibling species''' for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and '''species flock''' for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal [[taxonomic ranks]], '''species group''', '''species aggregate''', and '''superspecies''' are also in use.

Two or more taxa once considered [[conspecific]] (of the same species) may later be subdivided into [[infraspecific taxa]] (taxa within a species, such as bacterial [[strain (biology)|strains]] or plant [[variety (botany)|varieties]]), but this is not a species complex.

A species complex is in most cases a [[monophyletic group]] with a common ancestor, although there are exceptions. It may represent an early stage after [[speciation]], but may also have been separated for a long time period without evolving [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences. [[Hybrid speciation]] can be a component in the evolution of a species complex.

Species complexes exist in all groups of organisms. They are identified by the rigorous study of differences between individual species, making use of minute morphological details, tests of [[reproductive isolation]], or [[DNA]]-based methods such as [[molecular phylogenetics]] or [[DNA barcoding]]. The existence of extremely similar species may cause local and global [[species diversity]] to be underestimated. Recognizing similar but distinct species is important for [[Disease prevention|disease]] and [[pest control]], and in [[conservation biology]], although drawing dividing lines between species [[species problem|can be inherently difficult]].

A species complex is typically considered as a group of close, but distinct species.&lt;ref name="Brown 1995" /&gt; Obviously, the concept is closely tied to the definition of a species. Modern biology understands a species as "separately evolving [[metapopulation]] [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]]" but acknowledges that the [[species problem|criteria to delimit species]] may depend on the group studied.&lt;ref name="De Queiroz 2007"/&gt; Thus, many species defined traditionally, based only on morphological similarity, have been found to comprise several distinct species when other criteria, such as genetic differentiation or [[reproductive isolation]] were applied.&lt;ref name="Mayr 1970"/&gt;

A more restricted use applies the term to close species between which [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]] occurred or is occurring, leading to intermediate forms and blurred species boundaries.&lt;ref name="Horandl 2009" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The informal classification, superspecies, can be exemplified by the [[grizzled skipper]] butterfly, a superspecies that is further divided into three subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JONG|first=R.|date=December 1987|title=Superspecies Pyrgus malvae (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) in the East Mediterranean, with notes on phylogenetic and biological relationships|url=|journal=Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie – via Naturalis Repository|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors apply the term also to a species with [[polymorphism (biology)|intraspecific variability]], which might be a sign of ongoing or incipient [[speciation]]. Examples are [[ring species]]&lt;ref name="Moritz 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowen 2001" /&gt; or species with [[subspecies]], where it is often unclear if these should be considered separate species.&lt;ref name="Muñoz 2013" /&gt;

===Included concepts===

Several terms are used synonymously for a species complex, but some of them may also have slightly different, or more narrow meanings. In the [[nomenclature code]]s of zoology and bacteriology, no [[taxonomic rank]]s are defined at the level between [[subgenera]] and species,&lt;ref name="ICZN 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICNB 1992" /&gt; while the botanical code defines four ranks below genera (section, subsections, series and subseries).&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode" /&gt; Different informal taxonomic solutions have been used to indicate a species complex.

==Identification==

Distinguishing close species within a complex requires the study of often very small differences. Morphological differences may be minute and only visible using adapted methods, such as [[microscopy]]. However, distinct species may sometimes have no morphological differences.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; In these cases, other characters, e.g. in the species' [[Life history theory|life history]], [[ethology|behavior]], [[physiology]], or [[karyology]] can be explored. As an example, [[bird vocalization|territorial songs]] are indicative of species in the [[Certhia|treecreepers]], a bird genus with little morphological differences.&lt;ref name="Tietze 2006" /&gt; Mating tests are common in some groups such as fungi to confirm the [[reproductive isolation]] of two species.&lt;ref name="Dai 2003" /&gt;

Analysis of [[DNA sequences]] is becoming increasingly standard for species recognition and may in many cases be the only useful method.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; Different methods are used to analyse such genetic data, for example [[molecular phylogenetics]] or [[DNA barcoding]]. Such methods have greatly contributed to the discovery of cryptic species,&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marques|first=Isabel|last2=Montgomery|first2=Sean A.|last3=Barker|first3=Michael S.|last4=Macfarlane|first4=Terry D.|last5=Conran|first5=John G.|last6=Catalán|first6=Pilar|last7=Rieseberg|first7=Loren H.|last8=Rudall|first8=Paula J.|last9=Graham|first9=Sean W.|date=2016-04-01|title=Transcriptome-derived evidence supports recent polyploidization and a major phylogeographic division in Trithuria submersa (Hydatellaceae, Nymphaeales)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13755/abstract|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=210|issue=1|pages=310–323|doi=10.1111/nph.13755|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; including such emblematic species as the [[fly agaric]]&lt;ref name="Geml 2008" /&gt; or the [[African elephants]].&lt;ref name="Roca 2001" /&gt;

[[File:Phylogeny species complex.svg|thumb|right|alt=Schematic phylogram with nine species, five of which form a group with short branches, separated from the others by a long branch|A species complex typically forms a [[monophyletic group]] that has diversified rather recently, as shown by the short branches between the species A–E (blue box) in this [[phylogenetic tree]].]]

Species forming a complex have typically diverged very recently from each other, allowing in some cases to retrace the process of [[speciation]]. Species with differentiated populations such as [[ring species]] are sometimes seen as an example of early, ongoing speciation, i.e. a species complex in formation. Nevertheless, similar but distinct species have sometimes been isolated for a long time without evolving differences, a phenomenon called "morphological stasis".&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; As an examples, the Amazonian frog ''[[Pristimantis ockendeni]]'' is actually at least three different species that diverged over 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Elmer 2007" /&gt;

[[Stabilizing selection]] has been invoked as a force maintaining similarity in species complexes, especially when adaptation to special environments, such as a host in the case of symbionts, or extreme environments, constrains possible directions of evolution: In such cases, strongly divergent selection is not to be expected.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; Also, asexual reproduction, such as through [[apomixis]] in plants, may separate lineages without producing a great degree of morphological differentiation.

[[File:Cryptic speciation.svg|thumb|left|alt=Scheme showing morphological stasis and hybrid speciation, with species presresented by circles, their color indicating morphological similarity or dissimilarity|Possible processes explaining similarity of species in a species complex:&lt;br&gt;'''a''' – morphological stasis&lt;br&gt;'''b''' – [[hybrid speciation]]]]

A species complex is usually a group that has one common ancestor (a [[monophyletic]] group), although closer examination can sometimes disprove this. As an example, the yellow-spotted "fire salamanders" in the genus ''[[Salamandra]]'', formerly all classified as one species ''[[Salamandra salamandra|S. salamandra]]'', are not monophyletic: the [[Corsican fire salamander]]'s closest relative was shown to be the entirely black [[Alpine salamander]].&lt;ref name="Steinfartz 2000" /&gt; In such cases, similarity has arisen from [[convergent evolution]].

[[Hybrid speciation]] can lead to unclear species boundaries through a process of [[reticulate evolution]], where species have two parent species as their [[most recent common ancestor]]s. In such cases, the hybrid species may have intermediate characters, as demonstrated e.g. in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies.&lt;ref name="Mallet 2007" /&gt; Hybrid speciation has been observed in various species complexes, such as insects, fungi, and plants. In plants, hybridization often takes place through [[polyploidization]], and hybrid plant species are called [[nothospecies]].

===Range===
&lt;!-- change to "Range and habitats" --&gt;

In regards to whether or not members of a species group share a [[Range (biology)|range]], sources differ. A source from [[Iowa State University]] Department of [[Agronomy]] says that members of a species group usually have partially overlapping ranges but do not [[interbreed]] with each other.&lt;ref name="iowa" /&gt; ''A Dictionary of Zoology'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 1999) describes a species group as complex of related species that exist [[Allopatric speciation|allopatrically]] and explains that this "grouping can often be supported by experimental crosses in which only certain pairs of species will produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]."&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The examples given below may support both uses of the term "species group."

Often such complexes only become evident when a new species is introduced into the system, breaking down existing species barriers. An example is the introduction of the [[Spanish slug]] in [[Northern Europe]], where interbreeding with the local [[black slug]] and [[red slug]], traditionally considered clearly separate species that did not interbreed, shows they may be actually just subspecies of the same species.&lt;ref name="Engelke 2006" /&gt;

Where closely related species coexist in [[sympatry]], it is often a particular challenge to understand how these similar species persist without outcompeting each other. [[Niche partitioning]] is one mechanism invoked to explain this. Studies in some species complexes indeed suggest that species divergence went in par with ecological differentiation, with species now preferring different microhabitats.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Similar methods also found that the Amazonian frog ''[[Eleutherodactylus ockendeni]]'' is actually at least 3 different species that diverged over 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Elmer 2007" /&gt;
A ''species flock'' may arise when a species penetrates a new geographical area and diversifies to occupy a variety of [[ecological niche]]s; this process is known as [[adaptive radiation]]. The first species flock to be recognized as such was the 13 species of [[Darwin's finches]] on the [[Galápagos Islands]] described by [[Charles Darwin]].

==Practical implications==

===Biodiversity estimates===

It has been suggested that cryptic species complexes are very common in the marine environment.&lt;ref name="Knowlton 1993" /&gt; Although this suggestion came before the detailed analysis of many systems using DNA sequence data, it has been proven correct.&lt;ref name="Knowlton 2000" /&gt; The increased use of DNA sequence in the investigation of organismal diversity (also called [[Phylogeography]] and [[DNA barcoding]]) has led to the discovery of a great many cryptic species complexes in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan ''[[Celleporella|Celleporella hyalina]]'',&lt;ref name="Gómez 2007" /&gt; detailed morphological analyses and mating compatibility tests between the isolates identified by DNA sequence analysis were used to confirm that these groups consisted of more than 10 ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many million years.

Evidence from the identification of cryptic species has led some{{Who|date=April 2010}} to conclude that current estimates of global species richness are too low.

===Disease and pathogen control===

[[File:AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg|thumb|alt=A mosquito sitting on the tip of a finger|The ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' mosquito complex contains [[malaria]] vector and non-vector species.&lt;ref name="Besansky 1994" /&gt;]]

Pests, species causing diseases, and their vectors, have direct importance for humans. When they are found to be cryptic species complexes, the ecology and virulence of each of these species needs to be reevaluated to devise appropriate control strategies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Examples are cryptic species in the [[malaria]] vector genus of mosquito, ''[[Anopheles]]'', or the fungi causing [[cryptococcosis]].

===Conservation biology===
When a species is found to comprise in fact several phylogenetically distinct species, each of these typically have smaller distribution ranges and population sizes than reckoned before. These different species can also differ in their ecology, e.g. having different breeding strategies or habitat requirements, which has to be taken into account for appropriate management.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For example, [[giraffe]] populations and subspecies differ genetically to such an extent that they may be considered species; while the giraffe as a whole is not considered threatened, considering each cryptic species separately would mean a much higher level of threat.&lt;ref name="Brown 2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of "Mission Survivability" whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the "survivability" of a platform through a complete mission, or the "survivability" of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of "Force Survivability" which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain "mission capable".

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of "crew survivability" is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment:

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

==Network==

===Definitions of network survivability===

'''Design standards''', '''reference standards''' and '''performance standards''' are familiar throughout business and industry, virtually for anything that is definable.  [[Sustainable design]], taken as reducing our impact on the earth and making things better at the same time, is in the process of becoming defined.   There are also lots of well organized specific methodologies that are used by different communities of people for different purposes.

== Design standards ==
One of the better known is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) green building rating system, which uses a diverse group of hard measures of environmental quality and impacts to define a holistic approach to sustainable building and assign ratings to individual projects.

Sustainable design is really just a more determined effort to consider the whole range of impacts on our environment in making any decision. A more complete design guide, guided more by whole project impact measures, is the model offered by the U.S. cooperating agencies in the [http://www.wbdg.org/ "Whole Building Design Guide"].

Green construction codes and standards are beginning to emerge on the national code stage. The standards go beyond energy standards such as [[ASHRAE 90.1]] and the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC) to cover additional areas such as site sustainability, [[water efficiency]], indoor [[environmental quality]] and materials and resources. The first is [[ASHRAE 189.1]], Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, published by ASHRAE in January 2010 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]]. Standard 189.1 provides criteria by which a building can be judged as “green,” written in model code language that jurisdictions can use to develop a green building construction code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several organizations have developed their own ways of setting goals for energy reductions, such as [[Architecture 2030]] and for qualifying performance toward them such as [[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle to Cradle]].

== Design methods ==
Developing real methods for how to discover the design opportunities that would allow you to meet or exceed the standards was one of the objectives of the environmental design movement in architectural schools in the 1960s and '70s, but though some of the issues introduced then are still an important part of the process, not much actually changed about the methods of design.  Now with the combination of many more interactive tools and much higher stakes in the outcome, and long gestating rethinking about natural systems in general, a dramatic new revolution in methodology seems inevitable.

BIM (building information modeling) allows designers to work with many remote consultants on the same data file that represents all the decisions being made by the team.  That same file is available to the [[climate and energy]] and environmental impact analysis and cost analysis tools and consultants, ... and of course to the prospective contractors and the regulators.   Along with this new integrated access to the model there in needed a new way to integrate the conversation of so many people, each with some interest in reviewing each other's comments on the progress with the central design model.  That is likely to involve development of wiki tools for the process.  One such very early impliementation of a Wiki SD tool called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007000010/http://www.connection.metadot.net/ "4Dsustainability"] organizes the project design evolution around the general learning process of '''how you define the problem''' by exploring its environment, and following that through the project.

The main difference between sustainable design methods and conventional design is incorporating the entire environment of the project's stakeholders on the design team, essentially, and that calls for new ways to explore connections and for more people and perspectives to be taken into account.  Other methods that recognize this requirement are the [http://www.aia.org/liv_sdat "AIA SDAT"] (sustainable design assessment team) program and the [http://www.scenariosforsustainability.org/index.php "Scenarios for sustainability"] process design tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11573">'''Symbolic speech''' is a legal term in [[United States law]] used to describe actions that purposefully and discernibly convey a particular message or statement to those viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/results.pl?co=dictionary.lp.findlaw.com&amp;topic=bf/bf7657c95bca28020ec9503b1c50a000 "symbolic speech"]. ''Law Dictionary'', [[FindLaw]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic speech is recognized as being [[Protected speech|protected]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of speech, but this is not expressly written as such in the document. One possible explanation as to why the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] did not address this issue in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] is because the primary forms for both political debate and protest in their time were verbal expression and published word, and they may have been unaware of the possibility of future people using non-verbal expression.&lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"&gt;Epstein, Lee and Walker, Thomas G. (1998) "Constitutional Law for a Changing America: rights, liberties, and justice" 3rd ed. pp. 258-280 Washington D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic speech is distinguished from [[pure speech]], which is the communication of ideas through spoken or written words or through conduct limited in form to that necessary to convey the idea.

Although the First Amendment only limited the Congress, symbolic speech has also restricted state governments starting with ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'' (1925).

== O'Brien test ==
While writing the majority opinion for ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren|Warren]] described a series of guidelines used to determine whether a law that restricts speech violates the First Amendment. These guidelines must remain neutral in relation to the subject of the speech at hand (i.e., a speech that criticizes government action and is believed to violate a law must be treated the same way as a speech under identical circumstance, but praises the government as opposed to criticizing.) The ''O'Brien'' test is not meant to be the absolute deciding factor in cases involving non-verbal speech, but an additional tool to invoke against prohibitions. &lt;br /&gt; The ''O'Brien'' test is thus: The law in question must
* be within the Constitutional power of the government to enact.
* further an important or substantial government interest.
** That interest must be unrelated to the suppression of speech (or "content neutral", as phrased in later cases)
** Prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest.

==Major cases==
===''Tinker v. Des Moines''===
{{main|Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District}}
In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black [[armband]]s overlaid with a white [[peace sign]] between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7–2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} &lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"/&gt;  [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Abe Fortas|Fortas]], delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:
*"In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the [[Freedom of speech in the United States|Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment]] and the [[Due Process|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth]]."
*"First Amendment rights are available to teachers and students, subject to application in light of the special characteristics of the school environment."
*"A prohibition against expression of opinion, without any evidence that the rule is necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others, is not permissible under the First and Fourteenth Amendments."&lt;ref&gt;Syllabus for ''Tinker v. Des Moines''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. O'Brien''===
{{main|United States v. O'Brien}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their [[Selective Service System|Selective Service registration certificates]] on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse. A sizable crowd, including several agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], witnessed the event. Immediately after the burning, members of the crowd began attacking O'Brien and his companions. An FBI agent ushered O'Brien to safety inside the courthouse. After he was advised of his right to counsel and to silence, O'Brien stated to FBI agents that he had [[Draft-card burning|burned his registration certificate]] because of his beliefs, knowing that he was violating federal law. He produced the charred remains of the certificate, which, with his consent, were photographed.

For this act, O'Brien was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He did not contest the fact that he had burned the certificate. He stated in argument to the jury that he burned the certificate publicly to influence others to adopt his anti-war beliefs, as he put it, "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position."&lt;ref&gt;The facts of O'Brien's protest, arrest, and trial are summarized in the Supreme Court's opinion, ''United States v. O'Brien'', 391 U.S. 367, 369-70 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court ruled 7–1 against O'Brien. In the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech'. As such, O'Brien's protest was not protected because the United States had a [[Strict scrutiny|compelling interest]] in preventing the destruction or mutilation of draft cards. To help himself and future justices determine what may be protected under the free speech clause, he developed a series of requirements that laws must meet in order to stay out of conflict with the First, and thus be considered constitutional, known now as the ''O'Brien'' test.&lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"/&gt;

===''Texas v. Johnson''===
{{main|Texas v. Johnson}}
In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and [[Flag Burning|set it alight]] while those around him chanted "America the red, white and blue, we spit on you." He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. 
The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was "'Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication' to implicate the First Amendment." He also explained that the relevance of the ''O'Brien'' test is limited "in which 'the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression'", as the Texas law in question had its interest in preventing any violent reaction that may spring from those witnessing the burning of the flag. This case helped solidify the condition that any law that inhibits freedom of speech must have an important and compelling interest to do so.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Epstein, Lee and Walker, Thomas G.

===''Cohen v. California''===
{{main|Cohen v. California}}
In 1968, Paul Cohen entered a Los Angeles Courthouse wearing a jacket that displayed the words "Fuck the Draft" knowing that the jacket displayed these words. Though he had removed the jacket and placed it under his arm before entering the courthouse, a [[police]] officer witnessed the jacket and slogan in the corridor and arrested him for "willingly and unlawfully and [[Malice (legal term)|maliciously]] disturbing the [[peace]] and quiet by engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;

The Court voted 5–4 in favor of Cohen. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]] wrote "[A]bsent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display of this single four-letter [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] a criminal offense." In the court's opinion, Harlan also penned the now famous line "one man's [[vulgarity]] is another's [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cohen v. California]]'', 403 U.S. 15 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">'''Verification''' in the field of space systems engineering covers two [[Verification and validation|verification]] processes: Qualification and Acceptance

== Overview ==
In the field of spaceflight verification standards are developed by [[NASA]] and the [[European Cooperation for Space Standardization|ECSS]], and to specify requirements for the verification of a space system product, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/ESA/ECSS-E-10-02A_14991/ Space Engineering Verification], ECSS-E-10-02A, 17 November 1998, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the fundamental concepts of the verification process,
* the criteria for defining the verification strategy and
* the rules for the implementation of the verification programme.

Verification is one main reason that costs for space systems are high. All data are to be documented and to stay accessible for potential, later failure analyses. In previous times that approach was executed down to piece-parts level (resistors, switches etc.) whereas nowadays it is tried to reduce cost by usage of "CAM (Commercial, Avionics, Military) equipment" for non-safety relevant units.

== Qualification and Acceptance ==
Qualification is the formal proof that the design meets all [[requirements]] of the [[specification]] and the [[parameter]]s agreed in the [[Interface Control Document]]s (ICD) including tolerances due to manufacturing imperfections, wear-out within specified life-time, faults etc. The end of the qualification process is the approval signature of the customer on the Certificate of Qualification (COQ) agreeing that all his requirements are met.

Acceptance is the formal proof that the product identified by its serial number meets all requirements of the specification and is free of workmanship and material failures. Acceptance is based on the preceding qualification by reference to the used design / manufacturing documentation. The end of the acceptance process is the approval signature of the customer on the Certificate of Acceptance (COA) agreeing that all his requirements are met by the product to be delivered.

Qualification verification methods are
* Review of design using configuration controlled drawings (for software code review)
* Analysis
* Test (functions under specified environment, mass, dimensions etc.)
* Inspection (especially for Human Factors Engineering requirements with astronauts for manned spacecraft).
Each software element will be tested alone and as part of the overall system configuration until considered as qualified.

Acceptance verification methods are
* Test
* Inspection by Quality Assurance engineers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1928">'''Yi''', ({{zh|c=義|s=义|t=義|p=yì|tp=|j=Ji6|zhu=ㄧˋ|links=No|Phonetic=ㄧˋ}}), literally "[[justice]], [[righteousness]]; [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]]," is an important concept in [[Confucianism]]. It involves a moral disposition to do [[good]], and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html |title=The Main Concepts of Confucianism |publisher=Philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yi'' resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (''ren'') and skillful practice (''li'').

''Yi'' represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply [[virtue|virtues]] "with no loss of sight of the total good. ''Yi'' represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." &lt;ref&gt;(Cheng p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;

In application, ''yi'' is a "complex principle" which includes:

# skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
# the wise recognition of such fitness
# the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;
