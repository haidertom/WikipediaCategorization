The '''American Artists' Congress''' (AAC) was an organization founded in February 1936 as part of the [[popular front]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] as a vehicle for uniting [[graphic art]]ists in projects helping to combat the spread of [[fascism]]. During [[World War II]] the organization was merged into the '''Artists' Council for Victory,''' which effectively spelled the end of the organization.

==Organizational history==

===Origins===

The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of fascism in the 1930s caused politics and arts to collide as cultural liberals united to work on common goals. Communist parties adopted a policy of forming broad alliances with anybody willing to oppose fascism and became known as the [[Popular Front]]. After the official formation of the United Front in 1935, artists in the U.S. began seeing themselves as the “guardians of liberal and democratic ideals” &lt;ref name="Hemingway"&gt;Andrew Hemingway, ''Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social art became significant, with 1933–38 seeing the formation of the [[John Reed Club]]s, the [[Artists Union]], the [[Harlem Artists Guild]], and the American Artists' Congress.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  Artists had an idealistic view of [[working-class culture]] and used the labor movement as a sort of prototype for their mission.  There was a shift in the patronage, subject matter, and position of the art produced during this time.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

By 1934 and 1935, it became clear that the John Reed Clubs' sectarian policies were not congruent with the Popular Front. At a meeting of the John Reed Club, the idea of an American Artists' Congress was discussed and twelve of those present were given the task of organizing it.&lt;ref name="Whiting"&gt;Cecile M. Whiting, ''Antifascism in American Art.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] was put in charge of forming its committee.  Almost all of those involved with creating the AAC were established figures of the Communist left and had some connection with the John Reed Clubs.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Mission===

The AAC hoped to establish a group of artists who realized that collective organization was necessary to combat [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; Politically and artistically, the congress attempted to distinguish itself from the John Reed clubs, which were specifically radical and rigidly adhered to a particular set of views.  By creating a group that was non-sectarian and tolerant of all affiliations, the AAC fit in with the goal of the Popular Front.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Julia Williams, ''Artists Against War and Fascism.'' New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the chairman of the congress stated that “The Congress does not demand any political alignments…all we ask is that artists who realize the threat of fascism come together, discuss the situation, and form an organization of artists for their own insurance…we do not want any emphasis on extreme radicalism."&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

The AAC was directed towards artists who believed that the cultural crisis was a reflection of the world economic crisis.  Their specific concerns were violations of international [[civil liberty|civil liberties]], the inadequacy of government programs, censorship, and the decline of traditional forms of patronage.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Early activity===

The membership brochure of the AAC read: “Membership in the Congress is open to any artist of the first rank living in the U.S. without regard to the way he paints or the subject matter he chooses to deal with in his work. The only standard for membership is whether he has achieved a position of distinction in his profession and the only requirement that he support the program of the Congress against war and fascism.”&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt; 

At the first congress meeting in 1936, the slogan was “Against War and Fascism."&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt; By the next year, the AAC toned down its platform and changed the slogan to “For Peace, for Democracy, for Cultural Progress."&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt;  The congress was anti-fascism and pro-democracy, and did not take a stance in favor of [[proletarian revolution]] as the John Reed Clubs had done. As a result, the congress attracted a wide group of artists with different backgrounds, styles, and political commitments. In November 1936, the congress claimed to have 550 members with branches in Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;  

Their first activity was to boycott the exhibition of paintings to be held in conjunction with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Internationally, the congress denounced Nazi repression in Germany and fascist aggression in Spain and China. They condemned censorship in the home and of artwork, and put on annual anti-fascist exhibits.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Due to the status of many of its members, the AAC was able to generate publicity and a greater impact in the art world.  It lobbied for a permanent federal art program, fought for a museum rental fee for exhibitors, and worked to get a showing of contemporary American art at the New York World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  In 1938, the Republican gains of the mid-term elections caused such federal art projects to be rendered more conservative.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

===The Loyalist Movement in Spain===

Internationally, the suffering in Spain under fascism was of particular priority to the AAC.  They devoted a great deal of political and artistic efforts to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalist cause]].  The organization urged lifting the American embargo of arms to the Loyalists and revising the [[Neutrality Act of 1937]], which prohibited such aid.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  Also in 1937, they organized theme exhibitions referring to the [[Spanish Civil War]], which raised money to send ambulances, food, and clothing supplies to the Loyalists.  These exhibitions make clear that the most prominent anti-fascist artists were concentrating on the plight in Spain.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  

Along with several organizations, the AAC formed the American Artists and Writers Ambulance Corps for Spain.  In 1939, the AAC was able to bring Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica to New York to be exhibited at the Valentine Gallery to raise money for the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; These attempts to help the Loyalist cause created organizational motivation for antifascist artwork that depicted images in Spain.  The resulting paintings were not literal representations of the conflicting parties in Spain but images of the essence of human suffering.  The various styles of paintings reflect the diversity of the artists aesthetic tastes and techniques.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Dissolution===

The AAC had a close association with the Communist party and eventually experienced fundamental dissension in beliefs.  At a meeting in 1940, to the shock of many members, the Congress endorsed the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]].&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;  It was believed that this implicitly defended Hitler's position by assigning the responsibility for the war to England and France. In addition, according to a succession letter, the Congress loosened its policy of boycotting Fascist and Nazi exhibits.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; 

At this time, 17 prominent members left the Congress, writing a letter of succession detailing why.  The AAC continued to function primarily with other organizations through 1941, but dissolved soon after U.S. entrance into the war.&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt;  The Congress then participated in a meeting called the Artists' Societies for National Defense, which established the Artists' Council for Victory, an organization that combined twenty-three artists' societies.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

In May 1942 the American Artists' Congress merged with the Artists Union, thus creating the [[Artists League of America]].&lt;ref name=monroe&gt;Gerald M. Monroe (1972).

'''Anti-Arabism''', '''Anti-Arab sentiment''' or '''Arabophobia''' includes opposition to, dislike, fear or hatred of, or advocacy of [[genocide]] of, [[Arabs|Arab people]].

Historically, anti-Arab prejudice has been an issue in such events as the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the Iberian Peninsula, the condemnation of Arabs in Spain by the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] in 1964, and the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] in Australia. In the current era, racial prejudice against Arabs is apparent in many countries including Iran, Poland, France, Australia, Israel, and the United States (including [[Hollywood]]). Various advocacy organizations have been formed to protect the [[civil rights]] of Arab citizens in the United States, such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) and the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR).

==Definition of Arab==
{{Further|Arab people|Arab culture}}
Arabs are people whose native language is Arabic. People of [[Arab]]ic origin, in particular native English and French speakers of Arab ancestry in Europe and the Americas, often identify themselves as Arabs. Due to widespread practice of [[Islam]] among Arab populations, Anti-Arabism is commonly confused with [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/race/story/0,11374,1120849,00.html |title=Islamophobia should be as unacceptable as racism |first=Faisal |last=Bodi |date=12 January 2004 |publisher=''The Guardian'' |accessdate=2009-06-22 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206151512/http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0%2C11374%2C1120849%2C00.html |archivedate=February 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are prominent Arab non-Muslim minorities in the Arab world. These minorities include the [[Arab Christians]] in [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Christianity in Syria|Syria]], [[Palestinian Christians|Palestine]], [[Christianity in Jordan|Jordan]], [[Christianity in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Christianity in Iraq|Iraq]] and Kuwait, among other Arab countries. There are also sizable minorities of [[Arab Jews]], [[Druze]], and [[nonreligious]]. Most Arabs are Caucasian. Exceptions are Mauritanian, Sudanese, Eritrean, Somali, and Comoran Arabs.

==Historical anti-Arabism==
[[File:Anti-Semitic Graffiti in San Pedro Sula.JPG|thumb|Graffiti in [[San Pedro Sula]], Honduras, calling for an expulsion of Arabs and Jews]]
Anti-Arab prejudice is suggested by many events in history. In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], when the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] by the indigenous Christians from the Moorish colonists was completed with the fall of [[Granada]], all non-Catholics were expelled. In 1492, Arab converts to Christianity, called [[Morisco]]s, were expelled from Spain to North Africa after being condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Spanish word "moro", meaning ''moor'', today carries a negative meaning.&lt;ref name="Echabe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Echebarria-Echabe |first=Agustín |author2=Emilia Fernández Guede |date=May 2007 |title=A New Measure of Anti-Arab Prejudice: Reliability and Validity Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1077–1091 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00200.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ethnically different from the Arabs in Spain at the time, the term Moro was also used pejoratively{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} by the Spanish since the 16th century to refer to [[Moro people|Muslim tribal groups]] in the Philippines; the term ''indios'' was used to refer to Christianized tribal groups.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

After the [[annexation]] of the [[Muslim culture of Hyderabad|Muslim-ruled]] state of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] by India in 1948, about 7,000 Arabs were interned and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-bab.com/bys/articles/freitag99.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000712123052/http://www.al-bab.com/bys/articles/freitag99.htm |archivedate=2000-07-12 |first=Ulrike |last=Freitag |publisher=British-Yemeni Society |title=Hadhrami migration in the 19th and 20th centuries |date=December 1999 |accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of January 12, 1964, ended the local Arab dynasty. As many as 17,000 Arabs were exterminated by [[black African]] revolutionaries, according to reports, and thousands of others fled the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel4.empireschildren.co.uk/category/chapters/index.php?chapter=472&amp;cat=3 |title=Country Histories: Independence for Zanzibar |work=Empire's Children |publisher=Channel 4 |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-06-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080318192427/http://channel4.empireschildren.co.uk/category/chapters/index.php?chapter=472&amp;cat=3 |archivedate = March 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whosfaultisit.blogspot.com/2006/09/homemade-genocide-arab-world-is.html |title=A Homemade Genocide |last=Heartman |first=Adam |date=2006-09-26 |publisher=Who's Fault Is It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onwar.com/aced/data/zulu/zanzibar1964.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215003654/http://onwar.com/aced/data/zulu/zanzibar1964.htm |archivedate=2001-02-15 |title=Revolution in Zanzibar 1964 |date=December 16, 2000 |work=Armed Conflict Events Data |publisher=OnWar.com |first=Ralph |last=Zuljan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Arabic Language and National Identity: a Study in Ideology'', [[Yasir Suleiman]] notes of the writing of [[Tawfiq al-Fikayki]] that he uses the term ''shu'ubiyya'' to refer to movements he perceives to be anti-Arab, such as the [[Turkification]] movement in the [[Ottoman Empire]], extreme-nationalist and [[Pan-Iranist]] movements in Iran and [[communism]].  The economic boom in Iran which lasted until 1979 led to an overall increase of Iranian nationalism sparking thousands of anti-Arab movements. In al-Fikayki's view, the objectives of anti-Arabism are to attack [[Arab nationalism]], pervert history, emphasize Arab regression, deny [[Arab culture]], and generally be hostile to all things Arab. He concludes that, "In all its various roles, anti-Arabism has adopted a policy of intellectual conquest as a means of penetrating Arab society and combatting Arab nationalism."&lt;ref name=Suleiman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabic Language and National Identity: A Study in Ideology|first=Yasir|last=Suleiman|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2003|page=238|isbn=0-7486-1707-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 20th and late 19th century when Palestinians and Syrians migrated to Latin America Arabophobia was common in these countries.&lt;ref name=turcofobia&gt;La "Turcofobia". Discriminación anti-Árabe en Chile.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern anti-Arabism==

===Algeria===
Anti-Arabism is a major element of movements known as [[Berberism]] that are widespread mainly amongst Algerians of [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and other Berber origin.&lt;ref&gt;"Le monde arabe existe-il ?", Lucien Oulahbib.&lt;/ref&gt; It has historic roots as Arabs are seen as invaders that occupied Algeria and destroyed its late Roman and early medieval civilization that was considered an integral part of the West; this invasion is considered to have been the source of the resettlement of Algeria's Berber population in [[Kabylie]] and other mountainuous areas. Regardless, the Kabyles and other Berbers have managed to preserve their culture and achieve higher standards of living and education when compared to Algerian Arabs. Furthermore, many Berbers speak their language and French; are non religious, secular, or Evangelical Christian; and openly identify with the Western World. Many Berber Nationalists view Arabs as a hostile people intent on eradicating their own culture and nation. Berber social norms restrict marriage to someone of Arab ethnicity, although it is permitted to marry someone from other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Du problème berbère au dilemme kabyle a l'aube du 21e siècle", Maxime Ait Kaki&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]], ethnic background is not a crucial factor in marriage between members of each group in [[North Africa]], when compared to social and economic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Lawrence |title=Bargaining for Reality: The Construction of Social Relations in a Muslim Community |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984 |pages=139–140 |isbn=0-226-72611-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regular Hate incidents between Arabs and Berbers and Anti-Arabism has been accentuated by the Algerian government's anti-Berber policies. Contemporary relations between [[Berber people|Berbers]] and Arabs are sometimes tense, particularly in [[Algeria]], where Berbers rebelled (1963–65, 2001) against Arab rule and have demonstrated and rioted against their cultural marginalization in the new founded state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Brett |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Fentress |title=The Berbers |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1997 |pages=278–282 |isbn=0-631-20767-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Berbers protest in Kabylia |publisher=BBC News |date=21 May 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1343153.stm |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Arab sentiments among [[Berber people#Modern-day Berbers|Algerian Berbers]] (mainly from Kabylie) were always related to the reassertion of Kabyle identity. It began as an intellectual militant movement in schools, universities, and popular culture (mainly nationalistic songs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Hugh |title=The Economics of Berberism: The Material Basis of the Kabyle Question in Contemporary Algeria |journal=Government and Opposition |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=223–227 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.1983.tb00024.x |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the authorities' efforts to promote development in Kabylie contributed to a boom of sorts in [[Tizi Ouzou]], whose population almost doubled between 1966 and 1977, and to a greater degree of economic and social integration within the region had the contrary effect of strengthening a collective [[Amazigh]] consciousness and Anti-Arab sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ofra |last1=Bengio |first2=Gabriel |last2=Ben-Dor |title=Minorities and the State in the Arab World |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=1999 |page=35 |isbn=1-55587-647-1 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabophobia can be seen at different levels of intellectual, social, and cultural life of some Berbers. After the Berberist crisis in 1949, a new radical intellectual movement emerged under the name ''L'Académie Berbère''. This movement was known by its adoption and promotion of Anti-Arab and [[Islamophobia|Anti-Islam]] ideologies especially amongst immigrant Kabyles in France and achieved a relative success at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slimani-Direche |first=Karina |title= Histoire de l'émigration kabyle en France au XXe siècle: Réalités culturelles et politiques et réappropriations identitaires |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2002 |page=140 |isbn=2-7384-5789-4 |language=French}} ''Translation from [[French language|French]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;These reactions are also residues of a violent and Manichean political discourse which was particularly developed after the Berberist crisis in 1949 (see the second part) and expressed by members or sympathizers of the L'Académie Berbère (Berber Academy). This political berberist and radical trend which was especially developed with immigration, wanted to be anti-Arab, anti-Islam, and willingly sank in a narrow Manichaeism. This trend has seen relative success among some Kabyle immigrants especially from Paris Region (Région parisienne).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the final game of the national soccer championship pitting a team from Kabylie against one from [[Algiers]] turned into an Arab-Berber conflict. The Arab national anthem of Algeria was overwhelmed by the shouting of Anti-Arab slogans such as "A bas les arabes" (''down with the Arabs'').&lt;ref name="rnesmw-p-150"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ethnicity and Power in North Africa: Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco |editor-last=Spickard |editor-first=Paul R. |first=Taoufik |last=Djebali |title=Race and Nation: Ethnic Systems in the Modern World |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=150 |isbn=0-415-95003-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of modern day Arabophobia in Algeria can be traced back to multiple factors. For some, Anti-Arabism movement among Berbers is part of the legacy of [[French Algeria|French Colonization]] or manipulation of North Africa. As from the beginning, the French understood that to attenuate Muslim resistance to their presence, mainly in Algeria, they had to resort to the [[divide and rule]] doctrine. The most obvious divide that could be instrumentalized in this perspective was the ethnic one. Therefore, France employed some official colonial practices to tighten its control over Algeria by creating racial tensions between Arabs and Berbers and between Jews and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joan E. |last1=Gross |first2=David A. |last2=McMurray |title=Berber Origins and the Politics of Ethnicity in Colonial North African Discourse |journal = PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=39–58 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.1525/pol.1993.16.2.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the Berber language and traditions are deeply rooted in the North African cultural mosaic; for centuries, Berber culture has survived conquests, repression, and exclusion from different invaders: Romans, Arabs, and French. Hence, believing that its identity and specificity were threatened, the Berbers took note of the political and ideological implications of Arabism as defended by successive governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ethnicity and Power in North Africa: Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco |editor-last=Spickard |editor-first=Paul R. |first=Taoufik |last=Djebali |title=Race and Nation: Ethnic Systems in the Modern World |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=149 |isbn=0-415-95003-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradual radicalization and Anti-Arab sentiments began to emerge in Algeria and among the hundreds of thousands of Berbers in France who had been in the forefront of the Berber cultural movement.&lt;ref name="rnesmw-p-150"/&gt;

Houda claims that the police's motivation is racism which he says is "alive and well" in [[Bankstown]]. He has been stopped going to prayers, with relatives and friends and has been subjected to a humiliating body search. He has been the object of several groundless accusations of robbery or holding a knife. A senior lawyer told the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] that the police harassment was due to the police enmity against Houda's clients and the Australian Arab community.&lt;ref name="AdamHouda1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Suing police again, the lawyer of Middle Eastern appearance |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/suing-police-again-the-lawyer-of-middle-eastern-appearance-20111112-1ncvd.html |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2012-07-19 |author=Mercer, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first falsely arrested in 2000 for which he was awarded $145,000 damages by a judge who described his persecution as "shocking". Constable Lance Stebbing was found to have maliciously arrested Houda, as well as using profanities against him and approaching him in a "menacing manner". Stebbing was supported by other police, against the testimony of many eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="AdamHouda9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments/2005nswsc.nsf/66950614059df523ca25673900081e8e/0f0bd2707fc26affca25709e001f46f6?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121127042143/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments/2005nswsc.nsf/66950614059df523ca25673900081e8e/0f0bd2707fc26affca25709e001f46f6?OpenDocument |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-11-27 |publisher=LawLink NSW |date=2005-10-26 |title=Houda v The State of New South Wales |quote=It is common ground that Constable Stebbing laid the charge against the plaintiff comprised in the Field Court Attendance Notice (Exhibit Z) of assaulting him and that that charge was terminated in favour of the plaintiff.

He then, because of his personal contact with the events well knew that the offence had not been committed. Accordingly the count of malicious prosecution has been established. ... I am further comfortably satisfied on the probabilities that Constable Stebbing, with the assistance of other police officers imprisoned the plaintiff and that imprisonment caused him to be escorted to the police station and held there for a period of about one hour. For reasons already given the constable had no reasonable or probable cause for imprisoning him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Houda accused the police of disabling his mobile phone making it difficult to perform his work as a criminal defense lawyer.&lt;ref name="AdamHouda5"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Lawyer wins $145,000 for 'spiteful' arrest |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/police-are-disabling-my-phone-houda/2005/11/12/1131578275328.html |date=2005-11-12 |accessdate=2012-07-19 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Houda, his lawyer Chris Murphy, and Channel Seven journalist Adam Walters claimed that Frank Menilli, a senior [[New South Wales]] police officer, behaved in a corrupt fashion by trying to alter [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]]'s coverage of the Houda Case by promising Walters inside information in exchange for presenting the case in the police's favour.

These charges were thrown out of court by Judge John Connell who stated "At the end of the day, here were three men of Middle Eastern appearance walking along a suburban street, for all the police knew, minding their own business at an unexceptional time of day, in unexceptional clothing, except two of the men had hooded jumpers.

France used to be a colonial [[empire]], with still great post-colonial power over its former [[colonies]], using Africa as a reservoir for labor, especially in moments of dire need. During [[World War I]], reconstruction and shortages made France bring thousands of North African workers. Out of a total of 116,000 workers from 1914–1918, 78,000 [[Algeria]]ns, 54,000 [[Morocco|Moroccans]], and [[Tunisia]]ns were requisitioned.{{dubious|mathematically impossible|date=February 2011}} Two hundred and forty thousand Algerians were mobilized or drafted, and two thirds of these were soldiers who served mostly in France. This constituted more than one-third of the men of those nations from ages 20–40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alain |last1=Gillette |first2=Abdelmalek |last2=Sayadm |title=L'immigration algérienne en France |location=Paris |publisher=Editions Entente |year=1984 |page=50 |lastauthoramp=y |isbn=2-7266-0018-2 |edition=2nd |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Abdallah Laroui, Algeria sent 173,000 soldiers, 25,000 of whom were killed. Tunisia sent 56,000, of whom 12,000 were killed. Moroccan soldiers helped defend Paris and landed at Bordeaux in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abdallah |last=Laroui |title=History of the Maghreb |others=Translated by Ralph Manheim |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1977 |pages=351–12 |isbn=0-691-03109-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, reconstruction and labor shortages necessitated even larger number of Algerian laborers. Migration (or the need for labor) was reestablished at a high level by 1936. This was partly the result of collective recruitments in the villages conducted by French officers and representatives of companies. Labor recruitment continued throughout the 1940s. North Africans were mostly recruited for dangerous and low-wage jobs, unwanted by ordinary French workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Mauco |title=Les étrangers en France: leur role dans l'activite economique |location=Paris |publisher=Armand Colin |year=1932 |page=170 |language=French}}; and {{cite book |first=Neil |last=McMaster |title=Colonial Migrants and Racism: Algerians in France, 1900-62 |location=New York |publisher=St Martin's Press |year=1997 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large number of immigrants was of great help for France's rapid post–[[World War II]] economic growth. The 1970s were marked by recession followed by the cessation of labor migration programs and crackdowns on [[illegal immigration]]. During the 1980s, political disfavor with President [[Mitterrand]]'s social programs led to the rise of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and other [[far right]] French [[nationalist]]s. The public increasingly blamed immigrants for French economic problems. In March 1990, according to a poll reported in [[Le Monde]], 76% of those polled said that there were too many Arabs in France while 39% said they had an "aversion" to Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Katherine |year=1997 |title=France's New Nazis: The Resistible Rise of Jean-Marie LePen |journal=International Socialist Review |issue=2 |issn=0020-8744 |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/02/LePen.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Interior Minister [[Charles Pasqua]] was noted for dramatically toughening immigration laws.&lt;ref name=migrinfo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=266 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126072745/http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=266 |archivedate=2009-11-26 |title=The Challenge of French Diversity |first1=Kimberly |last1=Hamilton |publisher=Migration Policy Institute |first2=Patrick |last2=Simon |first3=Clara |last3=Veniard |date=November 2004 |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights]] group [[Amnesty International]] says that in practice, Arabs are among a number of ethnic minorities that are disadvantaged and suffer discrimination by the authorities.&lt;ref name="dire human rights"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/76000/mde130102006en.pdf|title=Iran: New government fails to address dire human rights situation|work=Amnesty International|date=February 16, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist]] tendencies in [[Khuzestan]] exacerbate this. How far the situation facing Arabs in Iran is related to racism or simply a result of policies suffered by all Iranians is a matter of debate (''see: [[Politics of Khuzestan]]''). Iran is a multi-ethnic society with its Arab minority mainly located in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection, [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/iran_ethnoreligious_distribution_2004.jpg ''Iran ethnoreligious distribution 2004''], [[The University of Texas]] at Austin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed by some that anti-Arabism in Iran may be related to the notion that Arabs forced some [[Persian people|Persians]] to convert to [[Islam]] in 7th century [[AD]] (''See: [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]'').{{weasel inline|date=October 2016}} Author [[Richard Foltz]] in his article "Internationalization of Islam" states "Even today, many Iranians perceive the Arab destruction of the [[Sassanid Empire]] as the single greatest tragedy in Iran's long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]] |first=Richard |last=Foltz |author-link=Richard Foltz |title=Internationalization of Islam |url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_1741575641/Internationalization_of_Islam.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKSDkOP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_1741575641/Internationalization_of_Islam.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also: [[Anti-Persian sentiments]]'') Following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], many Iranians (also known as "[[mawali]]") came to despise the [[Umayyads]] due to discrimination against them by their Arab rulers. The [[Shu'ubiyah]] movement was intended to reassert Iranian identity and resist attempts to impose Arab culture while reaffirming their commitment to Islam.

More recently, anti-Arabism has arisen as a consequence of aggression against Iran by the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]]. During a visit to Khuzestan, which has most of Iran's Arab population, a British journalist, John R. Bradley, wrote that despite the fact that the majority of Arabs supported Iran in the war, "ethnic Arabs complain that, as a result of their divided loyalties during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], they are viewed more than ever by the clerical regime in Tehran as a potential [[fifth column]], and suffer from a policy of discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/786/re7.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060321185923/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/786/re7.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-21 |first=John |last=Bradley |publisher=''Al-Ahram Weekly'' |title=Ethnicity versus theocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Iran's Arab population played an important role in defending Iran during the Iran-Iraq War and most refused to heed Saddam Hussein's call for an uprising and instead fought against their fellow Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/iran_iraq_war/iran_iraq_war1.php |title=Iran-Iraq War 1980–1988 |author= |work=History of Iran |publisher=Iran Chamber Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Iran's former defense minister [[Ali Shamkhani]], an [[Khuzestan]]i Arab, was chief commander of the ground force during the Iran-Iraq War as well as serving as first deputy commander of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]].

The Arab minority of southern Iran has been subject to discriminations, persecution in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article666792.ece|location=London|work=The Times|title=Tehrans secret war against its own people|first=Peter|last=Tatchell|date=October 10, 2006|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published in February 2006, Amnesty International stated that the "Arab population of Iran is one of the most economically and socially deprived in Iran" and that Arabs have "reportedly been denied state employment under the ''gozinesh'' [job placement] criteria."
{{Quote|text=Furthermore, land [[Nationalization|expropriation]] by the Iranian authorities is reportedly so widespread that it appears to amount to a policy aimed at dispossessing Arabs of their traditional lands. This is apparently part of a strategy aimed at the forcible relocation of Arabs to other areas while facilitating the transfer of non-Arabs into Khuzestan and is linked to economic policies such as zero-interest loans which are not available to local Arabs.|author=Amnesty International|source=&lt;ref name="dire human rights"/&gt;}}

Critics of such reports have pointed out that they are often based on sketchy sources and are not always to be trusted at face value (see: [[Politics of Khūzestān Province#Human rights|Criticism of human rights reports on Khuzestan]]). Furthermore, critics point out that Arabs have social mobility in Iran, with a number of famous Iranians from the worlds of arts, sport, literature, and politics having Arab origins (see: [[List of Iranian Arabs|Iranian Arabs]]) illustrating Arab-Iranian participation in Iranian economics, society, and politics. They contend that Khuzestan province, where most of Iran's Arabs live, is actually one of the more economically advanced provinces of Iran, more so than many of the Persian-populated provinces.

Some critics of the Iranian government contend that it is carrying out a policy of anti-Arab [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=A&amp;Id=1626 |title=Ahmanidejad's Jihad |last=Casaca |first=Paulo |authorlink=Paulo Casaca |date=2006-01-19 |publisher=Café Babel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524042325/http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=A&amp;Id=1626 |archivedate=May 24, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zope06.v.servelocity.net/hjs/sections/middleeast/document.2006-03-07.9070964039 |title=While the West fiddles, Iran's people... |last=Frampton |first=Martyn |date=2006-03-07 |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901231253/http://zope06.v.servelocity.net/hjs/sections/middleeast/document.2006-03-07.9070964039 |archivedate=September 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been large amounts of investment in industrial projects such as the ''Razi Petrochemical Complex'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40262-1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318184638/http://branch.isna.ir/mainkhouzestan/PicView.aspx?Pic=Pic-40262-1 |date=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; local universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajums.ac.ir/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011070206/http://ajums.ac.ir/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-11 |title=دانشگاه علوم پزشکی و خدمات درمانی جندی شاپور اهواز |publisher=Ajums.ac.ir |accessdate=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cua.ac.ir/ |title=welcome to cua.ac.ir |publisher=Cua.ac.ir |accessdate=2009-07-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109075935/http://www.cua.ac.ir/ |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.put.ac.ir/WebUI/uniform/Default.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061214154335/http://www.put.ac.ir/WebUI/uniform/Default.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-12-14 |title=دانشگاه صنعت نفت |publisher=Put.ac.ir |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other national projects such as hydroelectric dams (such as the [[Karkheh Dam]], which cost $700 million to construct) and nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran to build new nuclear plant |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4498932.stm |publisher=BBC | date=2005-12-05 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; many critics of Iran's economic development policies have pointed to the poverty suffered by Arabs in Khuzestan as proof of an anti-Arab policy agenda.

However, it is also true that non-Arab provinces such as [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province]], [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]], and neighboring [[Īlām Province]] also suffer high levels of poverty, indicating that government policy is not disadvantaging Arabs alone but other regions, including some with large ethnically Persian populations.

As a consequence of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] there is a certain level of hostility between sections of the Jewish and Arab societies in Israel. Many Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships, particularly between Jewish women and Arab men. A group of men in [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of [[Petah Tikva]] has a telephone hotline to inform on Jewish girls who date Arab men, as well as a psychological counseling service. [[Kiryat Gat]] launched a school programme to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198149221&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708082344/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198149221&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title='Protecting' Jewish girls from Arabs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090925/FOREIGN/709249932/0/rss |title=Israeli drive to prevent Jewish girls dating Arabs |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |first=Jonathan |last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of occasions, Israeli Jewish demonstrators and rioters used racist anti-Arab slogans.

In August 2005, Israeli soldier Eden Natan-Zada traveled to an Israeli Arab town and massacred four civilians. Israeli Arabs said they would draw up a list of grievances after the [[terrorist]] attack of [[Eden Natan-Zada]]. "This was a planned terror attack and we find it extremely difficult to treat it as an individual action," Abed Inbitawi, an Israeli-Arab spokesman, told ''The Jerusalem Post''. "It marks a certain trend that reflects a growing tendency of fascism and racism in Israeli society generally as well as the establishment towards the minority Arab community," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Rudge |title=Israeli Arabs: Israel is racist |url=http://www.newsdesk.org/archives/000267.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026125458/http://www.newsdesk.org/archives/000267.php |archivedate=2005-10-26 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2005-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 poll conducted by Geocartographia for the Centre for the Struggle Against Racism, 41% of Israelis support Arab-Israeli [[Religious segregation|segregation]] at entertainment venues, 40% believed "the state needs to support the emigration of Arab citizens", and 63% believed Arabs to be a "security and [[demographic threat]]" to Israel.

Since the 2000s, groups such as [[Lehava]] have been formed in Israel to prevent that Israeli Arab men form relationships with Jewish women. Some of the material promoted to discourage Jewish women to be with Arab men, are sanctioned by local governments and police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/29/israel-jewish-arab-couples|title=Israel's vile anti-miscegenation squads|author=Seth Freedman|date=29 September 2009|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehava has received permission from Israeli courts to picket the weddings uniting a Palestinian and a Jewish partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Israeli court allows protesters to picket Palestinian-Jewish wedding|date=17 August 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/israeli-court-protesters-picket-palestinian-jewish-wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the image projected of Jews in [[Nazi Germany]], the image of Arabs projected by [[Western world|western]] movies is often that of "money-grubbing caricatures that sought world domination, worshipped a different God, killed innocents, and lusted after blond virgins".&lt;ref name="Hollywood1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaheen |first=Jack G. |authorlink=Jack Shaheen |year=2000 |title=Hollywood's Muslim Arabs |journal=The Muslim World |volume=90 |issue=1–2 |pages=22–42 |issn=0027-4909 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2000.tb03680.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 film ''[[Rules of Engagement (film)|Rules of Engagement]]'' drew criticism from Arab groups and was described as "probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood" by the ADC.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt; Paul Clinton of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote "at its worst, it's blatantly racist, using Arabs as cartoon-cutout bad guys".&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt;

[[Jack Shaheen]], in his book ''[[Reel Bad Arabs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaheen |first=Jack G. |authorlink=Jack Shaheen |title=[[Reel Bad Arabs]] |year=2001 |publisher=Interlink Publishing Group |isbn=1-56656-388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed more than 900 film appearances of Arab characters. Of those, only a dozen were positive and 50 were balanced. Shaheen writes that "[Arab] stereotypes are deeply ingrained in American cinema. From 1896 until today, filmmakers have collectively indicted all Arabs as Public Enemy #1 – brutal, heartless, uncivilized religious fanatics and money-mad cultural "others" bent on terrorizing civilized Westerners, especially [Christians] and [Jews]. Much has happened since 1896&amp;nbsp;... Throughout it all, Hollywood's caricature of the [Arab] has prowled the silver screen. He is there to this day – repulsive and unrepresentative as ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Levesque|title=Arabs suffer in the hands of Hollywood|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/63118_tv21.shtml|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=March 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Newsweek]]'' columnist [[Meg Greenfield]], anti-Arab sentiment presently promotes misconceptions about Arabs and hinders genuine peace in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Hollywood1"/&gt;

In 1993, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee confronted [[Disney]] about anti-Arab racist content in its animated film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. At first Disney denied any problems but eventually relented and changed two lines in the opening song. Members of the ADC were still unhappy with the portrayal of Arabic characters and the referral to the Middle East as "barbaric".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gIyH_DLYhoIC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q |first=Karl F. |last=Cohen |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |page=74 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |date=March 1998 |isbn=978-0-7864-0395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, ''The Link'', a magazine published by [[Americans for Middle East Understanding]], contained an article "The Arab Stereotype on Television" which detailed negative Arab stereotypes that appeared in TV shows including ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'', ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'' and an educational children's show on PBS.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

==Arab Advocacy Organisations==

===United States===
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) was founded in 1980 by [[United States Senator]] [[James Abourezk]]. The ADC claims that it is the largest Arab-American grassroots [[civil rights]] organization in the United States. Warren David is the national president of ADC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adc.org/about-us/adc-staff/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719183930/http://www.adc.org/about-us/adc-staff/ |date=July 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2010, Sara Najjar-Wilson replaced former Democratic [[United States Congressman|US Congresswoman]] [[Mary Rose Oakar]] as president. ADC claims that is at the forefront in addressing anti-Arabism - discrimination and bias against Arab Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adc.org |title=American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee web page |publisher=Adc.org |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1985 by [[James Zogby]], a prominent Democrat, the [[Arab American Institute]] (AAI) states that it is a partisan non-profit, membership organization and advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. that focuses on the issues and interests of Arab-Americans nationwide. The AAI also conducts research related to anti-Arabism in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League identifies the [[Arab American Institute]] as an anti-Israel protest organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/Israel/israel_protest_calendar_groups.asp|title=U.S. Anti-Israel Activity |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=March 27, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914111806/http://www.adl.org/Israel/Israel_protest_calendar_groups.asp|archivedate=September 14, 2010|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an AAI 2007 poll of Arab-Americans:
{{quote|text=Experiences of discrimination are not uniform within the Arab American community, with 76% of young Arab Americans (18 to 29 years old) and 58% of Arab American Muslims reporting that they have "personally experienced discrimination in the past because of [their] ethnicity," as opposed to 42% of respondents overall... . Comparisons with previous AAI polls in which this same question was asked indicate a rise in experiences of discrimination amongst young Arab Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=AAI/Zogby Poll on Arab American Experiences and Identity Shows Increase in Discrimination Among Young Arab Americans|publisher=Arab American Institute|date=July 16, 2007|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/page/-/Polls/r-2007%20AA%20Identity%20poll%20-%20FINAL.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081024115005/http://www.aaiusa.org/page/-/Polls/r-2007%20AA%20Identity%20poll%20-%20FINAL.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 24, 2008|format=PDF|accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) is an Islamic organization in North America that was created in June 1994.&lt;ref name='CAIR-25FACTS'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cair.com/factsaboutcair.asp |title=25 Facts about CAIR: Did you know? |accessdate=2007-08-25 |publisher=CAIR |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826144932/http://www.cair.com/factsaboutcair.asp |archivedate=August 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cair.com/default.asp?Page=About|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060711203550/http://www.cair.com/default.asp?Page=About|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 11, 2006|title=About|publisher=CAIR|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been active against anti-Arabism as well.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Strum, [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060807191748/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/DUSS_Arab_America.pdf American Arabs and Political Participation], [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which was founded to combat [[antisemitism]] and other forms of bigotry, actively investigated and spoke out against the rise in anti-Arab hate crimes following the September 2001 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="jewishsf2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Eskenazi |title=State's skyrocketing anti-Arab incidents pain area Jews |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/17057/edition_id/336/format/html/displaystory.html |website=Jewishsf.com |date=October 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the ADL urged the Speaker of the United States' House of Representatives to approve a resolution condemning bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans and American Muslims. The [[American Jewish Committee]], and [[American Jewish Congress]] have issued similar responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Urges House of Representatives to Consider Resolution Protecting Arabs, South Asians, Muslims and Sikhs |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |date=July 30, 2003|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4288_41.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the ADL national director issued the following statement: "we are disturbed that a number of Arab Americans and Islamic institutions have been targets of anger and hatred in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elaasar |first=Aladdin |title=Silent Victims: The Plight of Arab &amp; Muslim Americans in Post 9/11 America |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4184-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Says Americans Must Remain United, Reject Group Hatred in Aftermath of Terrorist Attacks |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |date=September 14, 2001|url=http://www.adl.org/presRele/dirab_41/3919_41.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League clashed with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a legal dispute regarding sensitive information the ADL had collected about ADC members' positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1999, the dispute was finally settled out of court without any finding of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="jewishsf"&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Wiener |title=ADL settles with Arabs, others to wrap up 6-year lawsuit |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070714090321/http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2007 |website=Jewishsf.com|date=October 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the ADL attempted to bar Arab members of CAIR from attending a conference on multicultural inclusion. In 2007 the ADL accused the Council on American-Islamic Relations of having a "poor record on terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cair-florida.org/ViewArticle.asp?Code=AA&amp;ArticleID=20|title=FL rights group rejects ADL demand to bar Muslim from panel|publisher=cair-florida.org|date=November 14, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009152951/http://www.cair-florida.org/ViewArticle.asp?Code=AA&amp;ArticleID=20|archivedate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAIR, in turn, accused the ADL of "attempting to muzzle the First Amendment rights of American Muslims by smearing and demonizing them". When the case was settled, Hussein Ibish, director of communications for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), stated that the ADL had gathered data "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations".&lt;ref name="jewishsf"/&gt;

'''''Burial of Saint Lucy''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Caravaggio]]. It is located in the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia located on the Piazza Duomo in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]].

==History==
According to ''[[The Golden Legend]]'', [[Saint Lucy]] had bestowed her wealth on the poor, in gratitude for the miraculous healing of her mother. Denounced as a Christian, she refused to recant, offered her chastity to Christ, and was sentenced to be dragged to a brothel. Miraculously, nothing could move her from the spot where she stood. She was pierced by a knife in the throat and, where she fell, the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse was built.&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Helen|title=Caravaggio: A Life|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813337944|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caravaggio.html?id=PHwNAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio had escaped from prison on Malta in 1608, fleeing to Syracuse. There his Roman companion [[Mario Minniti]] helped him get a commission for the present altarpiece. Caravaggio painted it in 1608, for the Franciscan church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro. The choice of subject was driven by the fact that St. Lucy was the patron saint of Syracuse and had been interred below the church.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was unusual, but especially important to the local authorities, who were eager to reinforce the local cult of St. Lucy, which had sustained a setback with the theft of her remains during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham-Dixon|first=Andrew|title=Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780241954645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lI76naiYuMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cafeterias del Malecón''' is an architectural project created by the (e)spacios Cuban design group and was shown for the first time at the Architecture [[wikt:biennale|Biennial]] of [[Havana]] in May 2004. It is composed of 5 ephemeral cafeterias, the design of each being inspired by the work of famous Cuban painters.

== The (e)spacios Group ==
The group was founded in 1998, and is composed of the architect Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia and of designers Raidán Valdés Hung and Maikel Sánchez. Their office is situated in [[Old Havana]]. The group’s aim is to erase the border between art, design and architecture.

== The project ==
Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia is the one who first came up with the idea of the [[Malecón]] project. Seeing that every time a building was demolished a cafeteria replaced it, she thought the group could come up with a new style and aesthetics.

With the help of designer Sulumi Sánchez Herrera, the (e)spacios group offered to create five ephemeral cafeterias, made of canvases stretched over metal frameworks. The design of these cafeterias was inspired by the work of five Cuban artists : [[Roberto Fabelo]], Ángel Ramírez, Arturo Montoto, [[Esterio Segura]] and Alfredo Sosabravo. Each cafeteria presents a specificity : the one based on the work of the artist Roberto Fabelo is specialized in seafood; another, inspired by Arturo Montoto’s work and whose theme is “fruity”, only sells vegetarian products etc.

The plans have been showcased at the Architecture Biennial of [[Havana]] in 2004 and received a warm welcoming from locals and art dealers.

Cellachy held the post of [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] and died in 1079. His obit is given in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] as follows- "M1079.4 Ceallach Ua Ruanadha, chief poet of Ireland in his time, died."

His obituary is given in the [[Annals of Ulster]] as follows- "U1079.1 Cellach ua Ruanada, chief ollav of Ireland, rested in peace."

His obituary is given in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]] as follows- "Annal CS1079 Kalends. Cellach ua Ruanadha, ollamh of Ireland, dies."

An Irish clavis or metrical tract has been preserved in the [[Book of Leinster]] as well as in the eighteenth-century manuscript [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] H 1 15, where it was copied from a fourteenth-century exemplar that seems now to be lost. [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] incorporated this poem in his Mittelirische Verslehren as Verslehre IV. In the [[Book of Leinster]] it was ascribed to a certain Cellach .h. Ruan, who may be identical with Cellach hua Ruanada.

The '''Church of Saint Augustine''' is a [[Catholic]] church located in  [[Alcamo]], in the  [[province of Trapani]].

== History ==
In 1506 the Fathers of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] had already a [[friary]] in Alcamo opposite Porta Saccari (a town gate) near the present via San Nicolò. As they bore hard being subject to the [[Bishop]]’s authority, in 1589 they built another friary, together with the Church of Saint Augustine, in the same place where the Church is located now.&lt;ref name="catcon"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.236, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1650 the premises were still being constructed because the monks lived in great poverty of alms in kind  and finally, in 1660,  for the same reasons they left both the Church and the friary to the vescovile Curia;  since 1713 they  were administrated by the parish of [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]].
During the years 1849-1850 it was rebuilt in the rectangular shape, with chapels having [[pilasters]] and [[Corinthian (architecture)|corinthian]] capitals; then it was  restored several times, while the area where there was the friary was used for private residences. 

At present the [[parson]] of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]] is the Rector of this Church.&lt;ref name="catcon"/&gt;

In 1876 they founded the ''Pia Unione Femminile Gesù, Maria and Giuseppe'': its founder, the priest  Antonio Barbuscia Santoro,  was told by  his mother, when a boy, that during his birth (with death danger for both of them), he had been consecrated to the [[Holy Family]].
The parson of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]] gave this priest an altar with the image of the Holy Family.  As “good and evil inside families and society originated from woman’s good and bad behaviour”,  the scopes of this Congregation were:

*to put a stop to all the evils filling the town
*to honour [[Jesus]], Mary and [[saint Joseph]]
*give to its members every means more profitable for their [[sanctification]] and the moral and religious edification of their families.

== Works ==
The Church has 5 altars and one [[nave]] with a [[barrel vault]]; there are 24 built-in [[pillars]] with [[Corinthian capital]]s.
[[File:Chiesa di Sant'Agostino.jpg|thumb|Main altar]]
*High altar: [[Saint Augustine]], a painting made by an unknown author; until 1835 it was dedicated to Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]], with a painting on canvas made 1610 by [[Giuseppe Carrera]], now hosted in the  anti sacristy of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church]].
*[[Brass]] [[Tabernacle]] in [[Gothic style]] and [[inlaying]]s (in the high altar &lt;ref name="catgui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p. 76-78-79, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the sides of the high altar there are a painting with saint Augustine and one with [[saint Monica]] on the right, and a painting with [[saint Rosalia]] and Our Lady of Dying People (Madonna degli Agonizzanti)&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt;
*First right chapel: [[Saint Nicholas]], [[wooden]] statue made by L. Santifaller 
*Second right chapel: a painting with the [[Holy Family]], dating back to the second half of the 19th century.

==Plot==

The book [[Frame story|details a bedtime story narrated]] by a grandfather to his grandchildren, chronicling the daily lives of the citizens of an unordinary town called Chewandswallow characterized by its strange daily meteorological pattern. Before the party is over, the town of Chewandswallow provides the townsfolk with all of their required daily meals by raining food. 

But then, even though the residents of the town enjoy a lifestyle devoid of any grocery shopping or cookery, after many, many centuries, the weather unexpectedly and inexplicably takes a turn for the worse. Things start to go worse in Chewandswallow rather than better. The food in the weather devastates the local community with destructive and uncontrollable storms of either unpleasant or dangerously oversized foods, resulting in unstoppable catastrophes for the townspeople. Their lives endangered by the threats of the storms, they relocate to a different community of normal non-edible meteorological patterns (after deciding to permanently abandon Chewandswallow), safe from the hazards that once were presented by raining meals. However, they are now forced to adjust to a new land where it rains rain and snows snow and food can only be gotten in typical fashion. The place to get food from in the new land is from malls and grocery stores.

The following morning, the man's grandchildren awaken to discover snowfall. After bundling up and hurrying outside to play, the granddaughter, in first-person narration, describes how the sun looks like a pat of butter and the snow like mashed potatoes, so much so that she and Henry could almost smell them.

==Sequels==
The follow up to the story, ''Pickles to Pittsburgh'', tells of the kids receiving a postcard from their grandfather, who claims to be visiting the ruins of what was once the fabled town of Chewandswallow. The kids then go to sleep and dream that they are there with him, helping to rebuild the post-apocalyptic landscape and restore it to where it is livable again, as well as giving the massive amounts of food away to poverty-stricken developing nations and homeless shelters around the world. This proves to be difficult, as there could be more food storms on the way.

A third book in the series, ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3: Planet of the Pies'', was released on August 27, 2013. It details a dream Grandpa had about the first manned expedition to Mars, where Martian society is being overrun by daily storms of pies.

==Film adaptations==
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (franchise)}}
On September 18, 2009, [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released an animated [[Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (film)|film adaptation]] of the book, and the DVD was released on January 5, 2010. A new cast of characters were created for plot development, while the synopsis was changed from food falling from skies from meterology to being made from a machine. [[Bill Hader]] and [[Anna Faris]] provided the voices of the two lead characters. Hader voices Flint Lockwood, "a young inventor who dreams of creating something that will improve everyone's life." Faris provides the voice for Samantha "Sam" Sparks, "a weathergirl covering the caution who hides her intelligence behind a perky exterior." [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Mr. T]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Bobb'e J. Thompson]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Al Roker]], [[Lauren Graham]], and [[Will Forte]] are also on the voice cast.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992475.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 "Hader, Faris spice up 'Meatballs'; Caan, Samberg, Mr. T round out 3-D project"]. ''Variety''. September 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-writers and co-directors Philip Lord and Chris Miller said that it would be a homage to, and a parody of, disaster movies such as ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[The Core]]'', and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37514 |title=Meatballs Spoofs Disaster Flicks |accessdate=2008-12-05 |last=Lee |first=Patrick |coauthors= |date=2006-08-16 |work= |publisher=SCI FI Wire | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821120206/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37514| archivedate = August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the book where a grandfather tells his two grandchildren a bedtime story about Chewandswallow, an inventor named Flint Lockwood, who lives in Swallow Falls (Chewandswallow’s original name before the food weather), invents a machine that turns the water vapor in the atmosphere into food. Originally the phenomenon was limited to Swallow Falls, but overuse of the machine causes it to malfunction and the food weather taking a turn for the worse, as well as spreading it across the world. A sequel to the film, titled ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2]]'', was released on September 27, 2013, however, it is based on an original idea, and not ''Pickles to Pittsburgh''.

==Game==

{{About|the storytelling style|music produced from within a fictional world|Diegetic music}}{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

'''Diegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|διήγησις}} from {{lang|grc|διηγεῖσθαι}}, "to narrate") is a style of [[fictional|fiction]] storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:
# details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
# the story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince, A Dictionary of Narratology, 2003, University of Nebraska Press, {{ISBN|0-8032-8776-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# there is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.

In diegesis, the [[narrator]] ''tells'' the story. The narrator presents the actions (and sometimes thoughts) of the characters to the readers or audience. Diegetic elements are part of the fictional world ("part of the story"), as opposed to non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story ("part of the storytelling").

== In contrast to mimesis ==
''Diegesis'' (Greek διήγησις "narration") and ''[[mimesis]]'' (Greek μίμησις "imitation") have been contrasted since [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s times. ''Mimesis'' ''shows'' rather than ''tells'', by means of action that is enacted. ''Diegesis'' is the ''telling'' of a [[Narrative|story]] by a [[narrator]]. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the ''invisible narrator'', or even the ''all-knowing narrator'' who speaks from "outside" in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 373 BC), [[Plato]] examines the "style" of "poetry" (the term includes [[comedy]], [[tragedy]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration."([[Plato]], [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], Book III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (''diegesis'') and imitation or representation (''[[mimesis]]''). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary "elsewhere" set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as "hypothetically actual" constructs, since they are "seen" in progress "here and now" without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] argues that kinds of "poetry" (the term includes [[drama]], [[flute]] [[music]], and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or "manner" (section I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III).

== Definition ==
In [[filmmaking]] the term is used to name the story depicted on screen, as opposed to the story in [[Real time (media)|real time]] that the screen narrative is about. Diegesis may concern elements, such as characters, events, and things within the main or ''primary'' narrative. However, the author may include elements that are not intended for the primary narrative, such as stories within stories. Characters and events may be referred to elsewhere or in historical contexts and are therefore outside the main story; thus, they are presented in an ''extradiegetic'' situation.

== In literature ==
For [[Narratology|narratologists]] all parts of narratives—characters, narrators, existents, actors—are characterized in terms of diegesis. For definitions of diegesis, one should consult Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''; [[Gerard Genette]]'s ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method'' (Cornell University Press, 1980); or (for a readable introduction) H. Porter Abbott's ''The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative'' (Cambridge University Press 2002). In literature, discussions of diegesis tend to concern discourse/sjužet (in [[Russian Formalism]]) (vs. story/[[Fabula and syuzhet|fabula]]).

Diegesis is multi-levelled in narrative fiction. Genette distinguishes between three "diegetic levels". The '''extradiegetic level''' (the level of the narrative's telling) is, according to Prince, "external to (not part of) any diegesis." One might think of this as what we commonly understand to be the narrator's level, the level at which exists a narrator who is not part of the story being told. The '''diegetic level''' or '''intradiegetic level''' is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. The '''metadiegetic level''' or '''hypodiegetic level''' is that part of a diegesis that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a [[story within a story]], as when a diegetic narrator himself/herself tells a story.

== In film ==
The classical distinction between the diegetic mode and the mimetic mode relate to the difference between the ''epos'' (or [[epic poetry]]) and ''drama''.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt; The "epos" relates stories by ''telling'' them through narration, while drama enacts stories through direct embodiment (''showing''). In terms of classical [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetics]], the cinema is an ''epic'' form that utilizes ''dramatic'' elements; this is determined by the technologies of ''the camera'' and ''editing''. Even in a spatially and temporally continuous scene (mimicking the theatrical situation, as it were), the camera ''chooses'' where to look for us. In a similar way, editing causes us to jump from one place (and/or time) to another, whether it be elsewhere in the room, or across town. This jump is a form of narration; it is as if a narrator whispers to us: "meanwhile, on the other side of the forest". It is for this reason that the "story-world" in cinema is referred to as "diegetic"; elements that belong to the film's narrative world are diegetic elements. This is why, in the cinema, we may refer to the film's ''diegetic world''.

"Diegetic", in the cinema, typically refers to the internal world created by the story that the characters themselves experience and encounter: the narrative "space" that includes all the parts of the story, both those that are and those that are not actually shown on the screen (such as events that have led up to the present action; people who are being talked about; or events that are presumed to have happened elsewhere or at a different time).

Thus, elements of a film can be "diegetic" or "non-diegetic". These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film, but can apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither taking place in the world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a [[non-diegetic insert]]. Titles, subtitles, and [[voice-over]] narration (with some exceptions) are also non-diegetic.

== In video games ==
In video games "diegesis" comprises the narrative game world, its characters, objects and actions which can be classified as "intra-diegetic", by both being part of the narration and not breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://devmag.org.za/2011/02/02/video-game-user-interface-design-diegesis-theory/ |title=Video game user interface design: Diegesis theory| last=Russell| first=Dave| date=2011-02-02| website=Dev.Mag| access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status icons, menu bars and other UI which are not part of the game world itself can be considered as "extra-diegetic"; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information. A noted example of a diegetic interface in video games is that of the ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series, in which the player-character is equipped with an advanced survival suit that projects holographic images to the character within the game's rendering engine that also serve as the game's user-interface to the player to show weapon selection, inventory management, and special actions that can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/31/4166250/dead-space-user-interface-gdc-2013| title = Deliberately diegetic: Dead Space's lead interface designer chronicles the UI's evolution at GDC| publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]| date = 13 March 2013| accessdate = 15 April 2015| first = Dave| last = Tach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School''' is both a [[burlesque]] [[cabaret]] and [[life drawing]] event originating in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Brooklyn]], at the Lucky Cat.  Dr. Sketchy's was founded in [[New York City]] in 2005, by [[illustrator]] and former artist's model [[Molly Crabapple]] and illustrator [[A.V. Phibes]] who later left to attend to her design studio.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;Kino, Carol (October 2, 2009).

Described as a cross between an old-fashioned life-drawing session and a new-wave cabaret, it usually meets every other Saturday at [[the Slipper Room]], a burlesque-themed bar on Orchard Street in Manhattan (though Crabapple has held it at other locations like Times Square), where approximately 50 artists, web designers, cartoonists and hipsters pay $12 each to draw a downtown personalities such as alternative model Raquel Reed or performance artist Amber Ray.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; In a typical sketching session, artists will drink alcohol, sketch burlesque models, and play art games in a bar or venue like an art museum.  Crabapple will often travel around the world visiting different Dr. Sketchy's.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Jennifer (2010).

''The Official Dr. Sketchy's Rainy Day Colouring Book'', by Molly Crabapple and John Leavitt, was released by Sepulculture Books in December 2006, and is in its second printing.

In 2010, a short documentary by Peter Bolte was made about ''Dr. Sketchy''.

Despite conservatism in continents such as Asia, Dr. Sketchy's appears to be widely accepted in Tokyo, Singapore and the Philippines.  The Singapore branch is headlined by the zesty{{weasel word|date=May 2014}} Becca D'Bus.

[[File:Fontana del Tritone,Rome.jpg|thumb|''Fontana del Tritone'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], Piazza Barberini, Rome]]

'''Fontana del Tritone''' (''Triton Fountain'') is a seventeenth-century fountain in Rome, by the [[Baroque]] sculptor [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. Commissioned by his patron, Pope [[Urban VIII]], the fountain is located in the Piazza Barberini, near the entrance to the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (which now houses the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]]) that Bernini helped to design and construct for the [[Barberini]], Urban's family.&lt;ref&gt;The Palazzo Barberini was built according to a plan by the architect [[Carlo Maderno]]. When Maderno died in 1629, Bernini took over supervising its construction. Both the fountain and palace are close to [[Borromini]]'s [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]]&lt;/ref&gt; This fountain should be distinguished from the nearby ''Fontana dei Tritoni'' (Fountain of the Tritons) by  [[Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri]] in [[Piazza Bocca della Verità]] which features two Tritons.

The [[fountain]] was executed in [[travertine]] in 1642&amp;ndash;43. At its centre rises a larger than lifesize muscular [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], a minor sea god of ancient Greco-Roman legend, depicted as a [[merman]] kneeling on the sum of four dolphin tailfins. His head is thrown back and his arms raise a [[conch]] to his lips; from it a jet of water spurts, formerly rising dramatically higher than it does today.  The fountain has a base of four [[dolphin]]s&lt;ref&gt;The dolphins are represented in their heraldic conventionalization, not as they appear in nature.&lt;/ref&gt; that entwine the [[papal tiara]] with crossed keys and the heraldic [[Barberini]] bees in their scaly tails.&lt;ref&gt;Two finished terracotta ''[[Glossary of sculpting terms|bozzetti]]'' at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], (accession numbers 52.218 and 52.219) securely attributed to Bernini, reflect his exploration of the fountain's themes of the intertwined upended dolphins and the muscular, scaly-tailed Triton.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Tritone'', the first of Bernini's free-standing urban fountains, was erected to provide water from the [[Acqua Felice]] aqueduct which Urban had restored, in a dramatic celebration. It was Bernini's last major commission from his great patron who died in 1644. At the Triton Fountain, Urban and Bernini brought the idea of a sculptural fountain, familiar from [[villa]] gardens, decisively to a public urban setting for the first time; previous public fountains in the city of Rome had been passive basins for the reception of public water.

Bernini has represented the triton to illustrate the triumphant passage from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' book I, evoking godlike control over the waters and describing the draining away of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Universal Deluge]]. The passage that Urban set Bernini to illustrate, was well known to all literate Roman contemporaries:

:''Already Triton, at his call, appears
:''Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears;
:''And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.
:''The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,
:''And give the waves the signal to retire.
:''His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent
:''Grows by degrees into a large extent,
:''Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound,
:''Runs the wide circuit of the world around:
:''The sun first heard it, in his early east,
:''And met the rattling ecchos in the west.
:''The waters, list'ning to the trumpet's roar,
:''Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.
:::&amp;mdash;free translation by Sir Samuel Garth, John Dryden, et al..&lt;!--retaining original spelling--&gt;

Two finished terracotta ''[[Glossary of sculpting terms|bozzetti]]'' at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Accession numbers 52.218 and 52.219.&lt;/ref&gt; securely attributed to Bernini, reflect his exploration of the fountain's themes of the intertwined upended dolphins and the muscular, scaly-tailed Triton.

==Subsequent history==
[[File:Sculptures of dolphins in Fontana del Tritone (Rome).jpg|thumb|''Fontana del Tritone'' dolphins heads]]
The Triton Fountain is one of those evoked in [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Fontane di Roma]]''. The legend applied to [[Trevi Fountain]] has been extended to this: that any visitor who throws a coin into the water (while facing away from the fountain) will have guaranteed their return to Rome.

The setting of the Piazza Barberini has changed significantly since the seventeenth century. Engravings of the time and photographs from the nineteenth century show much lower buildings around the piazza, which would have made the fountain much more dramatic. However, it is a tribute to the artistic judgement of Bernini that even now, with tall buildings around the traffic-ridden piazza, that the Triton Fountain can still maintain a dramatic presence.

'''''Gloucester Harbor''''' is a late 19th century painting by American artist [[William Morris Hunt]]. Done in oil on canvas, the impressionist painting depicts morning in the harbor of [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], a major fishing port in [[New England]]. The painting was one of Hunt's first forays into the school of impressionism, and the creation of ''Gloucester Harbor'' and several other impressionism-inflected works sparked Bostonian interest in the impressionist movement. The painting is currently on display at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/gloucester-harbor-32897|title=Gloucester Harbor|date=2017-03-01|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helga Grabstein.jpg|thumb|Helga Festival Gravestone]]

Calling „'''Helga!'''“ is a [[running gag]] at German concerts and festivals.

== Ritual==
A person may call for a ''[[Helga]]'',&lt;ref name="Neon"&gt;[http://www.neon.de/kat/freie_zeit/musik/88151.html Das Festival] auf neon.de&lt;/ref&gt; others answer and come to a chorus like group effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/de/music/faq/ &lt;2004-04-14&gt; Allgemeine Musiknewsgruppen-FAQ] auf faqs.org&lt;/ref&gt; „Helga ist tot!“ (Helga is dead) denies the helgaing request.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Thiel: [http://www.einslive.de/musik/extras/2011/06/festival_abc.jsp Das Festival-ABC] auf einslive.de&lt;/ref&gt; Further allegations se gravestones, memorials or graffiti. The background is unknown, some reports point to a rather rainy [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], where a high pressure cyclone called Helga was called for but didn't arrive in time. The call was namegiver for an annual prize for German festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalguide.de/derhelga/ Der Helga]&lt;/ref&gt; and is being  used by a service company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/festival-rituale-oliver-uschmann-ueber-crowdsurfing-und-helga-rufe-a-828387-4.html Rituale auf Festivals: Götter im Dixi, erhöret uns], Spiegel 2012

[[Image:ZiguinchorImpluviumEntrance.jpg|thumb|The 'case à impluvium' in Ziguinchor, Casamance, Senegal, a centre for the arts run by the Alliance Franco-Sénégalaise]]
An '''impluvium''' is a type of dwelling typical of the [[Jola people|Jola]] in the [[Casamance]] region of [[Senegal]]. It is a circular mud building, built with a ring of rooms around a walkway that circumscribes a central water trench, fed by an opening that allows water into the building. Impluvia remain cool in very hot weather as the water evaporates. There is a particularly fine example that serves as a hotel in [[Enampore]]. Impluvial architecture is also used by the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Edo]] of southern Nigeria, in which they consist of small courtyards cornered with large pots to collect rain water. Edo and Yoruba houses usually consist of several impluvia and courts. The amount and size of these courts depend on the social and economic status of the individual. Royal palaces in Yorubaland and the [[Kingdom of Benin]] possessed hundreds of impluvia sometimes floored with elaborate pavements made of potsherds and quartz pebbles arranged in decorative patterns.

==History==
The structures came into existence due to the areas climate and environment of been a rain forest. the region receives a lot of precipitation during the rain season and losses the water due to the soils polarity and so the people came up with a way to store the water for the dry season and they came up with the impluvial.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the things we're up to is breaking down the idea of philosophy as being the sort of thing that is undertaken only by a specialist and is impenetrable. Not to say laughable, frankly. And I think when we started – I founded the Institute of Art and Ideas seven years ago, two years before the first HowTheLightGetsIn – that was indeed the only way people thought about philosophy. But every human being, in a way, is a philosopher. Because that's what it is to be human. You wonder about life. You wonder about what you're doing. You wonder about where you're going. You wonder: "What the hell's going on"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/27/howthelightgetsin-2014-philosophy-music-hay-on-wye |title=HowTheLightGetsIn 2014: philosophy, music and thought for all |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1597">'''The University of Arts of Cuba / Instituto Superior de Arte''' ('''ISA''') was established on September 1, 1976, by the Cuban government as a school for the arts.  Its original structure had three schools: [[Music]], [[Visual Arts]], and [[Performing Arts]].

At present the ISA has four schools, the previous three and one for Arts and Audiovisual Communication Media. There are also four teaching schools in the provinces, one in [[Camagüey]], two in [[Holguín]] and one in [[Santiago de Cuba]].

ISA offers pre-degree and post-degree courses, as well as a wide spectrum of brief and extension courses, including preparation for Cuban and foreign professors for a degree of Doctor on Sciences in Art.

Predegree education has increased to five careers: Music, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, Dance Arts and Arts and Audiovisual Communication Media.

In 1996, the ISA established the ''National Award of Artistic Teaching'', conceived for recognizing a lifework devoted to arts teaching.

'''''It's Like, You Know...''''' is an American [[sitcom]] television series broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It starred [[Steven Eckholdt]], [[Chris Eigeman]], [[Evan Handler]], [[A. J. Langer]], and [[Jennifer Grey]], and depicted life in Los Angeles as viewed through the eyes of Eigeman's character, a diehard New Yorker named Arthur Garment. The series aired for two seasons, from March 24, 1999 until January 5, 2000.

==Synopsis==
The show sought to lampoon an upper class Los Angeles lifestyle, in part by presenting the Manhattan writer, Garment, as a fish out of water among Hollywood notables and the idle rich.  In the pilot his character arrives with unconcealed hostility, intent on treating his readers to a bitter satire on the absurdities and excesses of LA culture.  While staying with an old friend from college, Garment finds himself increasingly torn between button-down stern contempt for West Coast attitudes and a growing enchantment with the relaxed whimsy constantly swirling around him.

The show was also notable for featuring the actress Jennifer Grey playing herself, the source of a running joke related to her real-life [[rhinoplasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Huff, Richard |date=March 28, 1999 |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-03-28/entertainment/18101411_1_mehlman-nose-jennifer-grey

==Broadcast==
When ABC canceled the series, seven episodes remained unaired (six episodes from the planned second season, in addition to the original unaired pilot). These episodes have since aired abroad, including in [[Argentina]] on [[Fox Latin America]] and in Australia on [[The Comedy Channel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Reception==
Ratings for the series were low, due in part to the sudden explosion of reality programming and ABC's decision to dedicate much of its primetime schedule to the then-popular ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''.

'''[[Italy|Italian]] [[Rococo]] [[art]]''' refers to [[painting]] and the [[plastic arts]] in Italy during the [[Rococo]] period, which went from about the early/mid-18th to the late 18th century.

==History and background==
Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by the [[rocaille]] or French Rococo, since [[France]] was the founding nation of that particular style. The styles of the Italian Rococo were very similar to those of France. The style in Italy was usually lighter and more feminine than [[Italian Baroque art]], and became the more popular art form of the [[History of Italian culture (1700s)|settecento]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--citation[s] for entire paragraph, please--&gt;

The leading artistic centres during the [[Rococo]] in Italy were [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] and [[Rome]]. Most Italian Rococo artists came from [[Venice]], such as [[Canaletto]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Guardi]], [[Piazzetta]] and [[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/entertainment/italian-art-the-rococo-period.html&lt;/ref&gt; but also from [[Rome]] and [[Genoa]], such as [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]]. Artists such as [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit)|Castiglione]] and [[Alessandro Magnasco]] brought the vogue of Rococo art to [[Genoa]], and [[Naples|Neapolitan]] Rococo was mainly based on landscapes and naturalistic themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/ent/A0858942.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canaletto]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] were among the most prominent painters of the age, and they painted many frescos and cityscapes (particularly Canaletto).

==List of painters==

&lt;!-- no infobox, please --&gt;
'''''Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata''''' ({{lang|ja|霞織娘雛形}}, "Model Young Women in Mist") is a print series by the Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Kitagawa Utamaro]].  The theme is of beautiful women seen through different woven materials.  Three prints from the series are known; whether there were more is unknown.

==Background==

[[Ukiyo-e]] art flourished in Japan during the [[Edo period]] from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects [[oiran|courtesans]], [[kabuki]] actors, and others associated with the "floating world" lifestyle of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  Alongside paintings, mass-produced [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] were a major form of the genre.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In the mid-18th century full-colour ''{{transl|ja|[[nishiki-e]]}}'' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–83}}  A prominent genre was ''{{transl|ja|[[bijin-ga]]}}'' ("pictures of beauties"), which depicted most often [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}

[[Kitagawa Utamaro]] ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin [[ōkubi-e]]'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}

{{clear}}

==Publication==

The series was published in {{circa|1794–95}} by [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]].  It is not known how many were in the series; three are known, of which very few copies are known.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  The bear the seal ''Utamaro hitsu'' ({{lang|ja|歌麿筆}}, "the brush of Utamaro").{{sfn|Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, staff}}&lt;!-- and Tsutaya's publishing mark --&gt;

The prints are untitled, and variations of the titles that follow exist in both English and Japanese.&lt;!-- editor's note, not something that requires citation --&gt;

==Description and analysis==

The series theme is of beautiful women seen through translucent woven materials.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  Two women appear in each print, one in front and one behind and seen through the translucent materials.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=85}} ''Kasumi-ori'' ({{lang|ja|霞織}}, "mist-woven") is a [[neologism]] Utamaro uses to refer to materials woven so that they can be seen through unclearly, as in a mist.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}}  The translucent effect in the prints required the highest level of skill from their carvers{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} and careful moderation of the ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]'' burnishing tool by the printers.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}

===''Kachō''===

[[File:Utamaro (c. 1794–95) Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata - Kachō (AIC).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=]]

In ''Kachō'' ({{lang|ja|蚊帳}}, "Mosquito net", the same characters also pronounced ''kaya''), a woman peers through a light yellowish-green{{efn|Such nets came in light yellowish green or in white.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}} }} [[mosquito net]] of thin silk gauze, an item of great luxury at the time; commoners made such nets of hemp or cotton.  The woman wears a in a ''{{illm|narumi shibori|ja|有松・鳴海絞り}}'' [[tie-dye]]d komono patterned with scattered circles.  From above hang two ''[[hoso-obi]]'' sashes, one red and the other violet.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}}  This is the only print in the series in which the woman face each other;{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}} they appear to be in conversation.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}}

{{clear}}

===''Sudare''===

[[File:Utamaro (c. 1794–95) Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata - Sudare (MFA).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=]]

In ''Sudare'' ({{lang|ja|簾}}, "Reed screen"),  woman dressed as a daughter of a high-ranking [[samurai]] family sits behind a luxurious ''[[sudare]]'' reed screen hemmed with a flower pattern.  The woman who stands in front of the screen wears her hair in a {{illm|shiitake-tabo|ja|椎茸髱|lt=''shiitake-tabo''}}, a hairstyle asocciated with the women-in-waiting at high-ranked samurai homes.  Utamaro has posed the women so their hairstyles contrast—the woman behind the screen's is extravagantly tied and decorated, while the woman-in waiting's is much simpler.  The both have pleased, attentive expressions, and appear to be watching something—perhaps a show or presentation.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}

The collectors William&amp;nbsp;S. and John&amp;nbsp;T. Spaulding bought a copy of this print from the architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] while in Japan in 1913.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  The Spaulding brothers donated their copy along with the rest of their collection to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] on 21 December 1921.{{sfn|Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, staff}}

===''Natsu Ishō''===

&lt;!-- [[File:|thumb|upright|alt=|]]
--&gt;
In ''Natsu Ishō'' ({{lang|ja|夏衣装}}, "Summer clothing"), an elegantly-dressed woman standing in the foreground holds a ''[[kanzashi]]'' hairpin with her right hand to her hair,{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} which is made up in a {{illm|Baimage|ja|貝髷|lt=''baimage''}} hairstyle.  She appears to have just gotten out of the bath.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}  Another young woman looks at her from behind a translucent cloth{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} hung on a clothes rack.  The pair appear to be in conversation.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}

'''''Le génie du mal'''''  (installed 1848) or ''The [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of Evil'' or the genie of evil or the spirit of evil, known informally in English as '''''[[Lucifer]]''''' or '''''The Lucifer of Liège''''',&lt;ref&gt;"Le génie du mal" could also be translated as ''Evil Genius'' or even ''Evil Spirit''. French ''génie'' in this sense can overlap in meaning with its English [[Cognate (etymology)#Cognates across languages|cognate]] "[[Genie#Etymology and definitions|genie]]". The [[:fr:Accueil|French Wikipédia]] article on [[:fr:Génie du mal|Génie du mal]] deals with the stock character of the "evil genius" in fiction, film, and popular culture. Geefs may have had in mind the [[Genius#Philosophy|Kantian conception of genius]], which influenced [[Romanticism]] in the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt; is a religious sculpture executed in white marble by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[Guillaume Geefs]]. [[Francophone]] [[art historian]]s most often refer to the figure as an ''ange déchu'', a "[[fallen angel]]". It is located within the elaborate [[pulpit]] (French ''chaire de vérité'', "seat of truth") of [[St. Paul's Cathedral (Liège)|St. Paul's Cathedral]], [[Liège (city)|Liège]], and depicts a [[Classicism|classically]] [[Physical attractiveness|beautiful]] man in his physical prime, chained, seated, and nearly [[Depictions of nudity|nude]] but for drapery gathered over his thighs, his full length ensconced within a [[mandorla]] of [[Bat (animal)|bat]] wings. Geefs' work replaces an earlier sculpture created for the space by his younger brother [[Joseph Geefs]], ''[[:File:L'ange du mal (Joseph Geefs) cropped.jpg|L'ange du mal]]'', which was removed from the [[cathedral]] because of its distracting allure and "unhealthy beauty".&lt;ref&gt;In French, ''beauté malsaine'': [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], ''Le génie du mal'' by Joseph Geefs, Fabritius online catalogue [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/fabritiusweb/FullBB.csp?WebAction=ShowFullBB&amp;RequestId=68766_2&amp;Profile=Default&amp;OpacLanguage=fre&amp;NumberToRetrieve=10&amp;StartValue=85&amp;WebPageNr=1&amp;SearchTerm1=GEEFSJOSEPH%20.2.3570&amp;SearchT1=&amp;Index1=Index24b&amp;SearchMethod=Find_1&amp;ItemNr=5 description.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, a photograph of ''Le génie du mal'' became a focal point of ''[[Le génie du mal#Himmelsweg|Himmelsweg]]'', an [[Installation art|art installation]] by the Liège-born artist [[:fr:Jacques Charlier|Jacques Charlier]] on the theme of seductive evil and the danger of obscuring the memory of [[the Holocaust]].

''Le génie du mal'' is set within an open [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] formed at the base of twin ornate staircases carved with [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] floral [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]].&lt;ref&gt;The sculpture may be viewed in its architectural setting [http://www.wittert.ulg.ac.be/expo/19e/album/img/musees/geefs_genie_x.jpg online], and at an angle showing the [[stained glass]] windows [http://veroniqueliege.skynetblogs.be/tag/1/LIEGE-SENSUEL also online.] The view with stained glass windows is preserved also at the [[WebCite]] [https://www.webcitation.org/5gOjipWe8?url=http://veroniqueliege.skynetblogs.be/tag/1/LIEGE-SENSUEL archive.]&lt;/ref&gt; The curved railing of the [[stairway#Spiral and helical stairs|semi-spiral stairs]] reiterates the arc of the wings, which are retracted and cup the body. The versions by Guillaume and Joseph are strikingly similar at first glance and appear inspired by the same [[Model (art)|human model]]. For each, the fallen angel sits on a rock, sheltered by his folded wings; his upper [[torso]], arms, and legs are nude, his center-parted hair [[nape]]-length. The veined, membranous wings are articulated like a bat's, with a prominent thumb claw; the knobby, sinewy [[olecranon]] combines bat and human [[anatomy]] to create an illusion of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Soo Yang Geuzaine et Alexia Creusen, "Guillaume Geefs: ''Le Génie du Mal'' (1848) à la cathédrale Saint-Paul de Liège," ''Vers la modernité.

==The commission==

[[File:Chaire Cathédrale Liège 240809 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The pulpit in a 2009 photograph]]
In 1837, Guillaume Geefs was put in charge of designing the elaborate pulpit for St. Paul's, the theme of which was "the Triumph of Religion over the Genius of Evil". Geefs had come to prominence creating [[monument]]al and [[public art|public sculptures]] in honor of political figures, expressing and capitalizing on the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] spirit that followed [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence in 1830]]. Techniques of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] coupled with [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] restraint discipline any tendency toward [[Romanticism|Romantic heroism]] in these works, but Romanticism was to express itself more strongly in the Lucifer project.&lt;ref&gt;Geuzaine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''; [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], 19th-century sculpture collection [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/fr/frames/F_sculpture.html online introduction.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322045449/http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/FR/frames/F_sculpture.html |date=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, sculpture was an integral part of Geefs' pulpit design, which featured representations of the saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]], [[Hubertus|Hubert]] the first [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Bishop of Liège]], and [[Lambert of Maastricht]]. A drawing of the pulpit by the Belgian illustrator [[Médard Tytgat]], published in 1900, shows the front; ''Le génie du mal'' would be located at the base of the stairs on the opposite side, but the book in which the illustration appears omits mention of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration by [[Médard Tytgat]]  in Eloi Bartholeyns, ''Guillaume Geefs: sa vie et ses œuvres'' (Brussels: Schaerbeek, 1900), pp. 105 and 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was originally awarded to Geefs' younger brother Joseph, who completed ''[[:File:L'ange du mal (Joseph Geefs) cropped.jpg|L'ange du mal]]'' in 1842 and installed it the following year. It generated controversy at once and was criticized for not representing a [[Christianity|Christian]] ideal.&lt;ref&gt;''Ne rendant pas l'idée chrétienne'': quoted by Vicky Chris, [http://es.treklens.com/gallery/Europe/Belgium/photo425244.htm TrekLens.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115211210/http://es.treklens.com/gallery/Europe/Belgium/photo425244.htm |date=2017-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral administration declared that "this devil is too sublime."&lt;ref&gt;"Ce diable-là est trop sublime": originally quoted in ''L'Émancipation'', 4 August 1844, as cited by [[Jacques Van Lennep]], ''La Sculpture belge au xixe siècle, exposition organisée à Bruxelles du 5 octobre au 15 décembre 1990, La Générale de banque, Bruxelles'' (Exhibition catalogue, 1990); Geuzaine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''.&lt;/ref&gt; The local press intimated that the work was distracting the "pretty penitent girls" who should have been listening to the sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Marchal, "Étude sur la vie et les œuvres de Joseph-Charles Geefs," ''Annuaire de l'Académie Royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique'' (Brussels, 1888), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cornelius Richard Anton van Bommel|Bishop van Bommel]] soon ordered the removal of ''L'ange du mal'', and  the building committee passed the commission for the pulpit sculpture to Guillaume Geefs, whose version was installed at the cathedral permanently in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Fabritius [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/fabritiusweb/FullBB.csp?WebAction=ShowFullBB&amp;RequestId=68766_2&amp;Profile=Default&amp;OpacLanguage=fre&amp;NumberToRetrieve=10&amp;StartValue=85&amp;WebPageNr=1&amp;SearchTerm1=GEEFSJOSEPH%20.2.3570&amp;SearchT1=&amp;Index1=Index24b&amp;SearchMethod=Find_1&amp;ItemNr=5 catalogue], from Francisca Vandepitte, ''Le Romantisme en Belgique.

== Reception of Joseph Geefs' ''L'ange du mal'' ==
Joseph exhibited his sculpture at [[Antwerp]] in 1843, along with four other works: a sculpture group called ''The Dream'', and the individual statues ''St. [[Philomena]]'', ''Faithful Love'', and ''The Fisherman's Orphan''.&lt;ref&gt;Marchal, ''Annuaire'' p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Known both as ''L'ange du mal'' (''Angel of Evil'') and ''Le génie du mal'', the controversial piece was later received into the collections of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], where it has remained as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's work is often referred to as ''L'ange du mal'', but its formal title according to the Royal Museums' online 19th-century sculpture [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/fr/frames/F_sculpture.html catalogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322045449/http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/FR/frames/F_sculpture.html |date=2009-03-22 }} remains ''Le génie du mal''. The common title ''L'ange du mal'' is used in this article to distinguish Joseph's sculpture from that of Guillaume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite or because of the controversy, Joseph's work was admired at the highest levels of society. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Charles Frederick]], [[Grand duchy|Grand Duke]] of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Saxe-Weimar]], ordered a marble replica as early as 1842.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2009, this copy remains in the collections of the [[Goethe]] [[Goethe National Museum|National Museum]], [[Weimar]].&lt;/ref&gt; The deracinated original was purchased for 3,000 [[Dutch guilder|florins]] by [[William II of the Netherlands|William II, King of the Netherlands]], and was dispersed with the rest of his collection in 1850 following his death. In 1854, the artist sold a [[plaster cast]] of the statue to [[Bernhard von Lindenau|Baron Bernard August von Lindenau]],&lt;ref&gt;Royal Museums, Fabritius description; Edmond Marchal, ''La sculpture et les chefs-d'œuvre de l'orfèvrerie belges'' (Brussels, 1895), p. 684 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fCkEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA684&amp;dq=%22Le+génie+du+Mal%22+inauthor:Marchal&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; Michael Palmer ''et al.'', ''500 chefs-d'oeuvre de l'art belge du XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle à nos jours'' (Éditions Racine, n.d.), p. 203 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIhHTre5wYoC&amp;pg=PT206&amp;dq=%22Le+génie+du+Mal%22+intitle:500+intitle:chefs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; the German statesman, astronomer, and art collector for whom the [[Lindenau-Museum Altenburg]] is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindenau-museum.de/museum/index.html |title=Das Lindenau-Museum Altenburg |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420172857/http://www.lindenau-museum.de/museum/index.html |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the work elevated Joseph Geefs to the top tier of sculptors in his day.&lt;ref&gt;"Une légtimate admiration accueillit cette œuvre.

''L'ange du mal'' is among six statues featured in a painting by [[Pierre Langlet]], ''The Sculpture Hall of the Brussels Museum'' (''Salle de sculpture du Musée de Bruxelles'', 1882), along with ''Love and Malice'' by another of the six Geefs sculptor-brothers, Jean.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Roberts-Jones-Popelier, ''Chronique d'un musée: Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Bruxelles'' (Pierre Mardaga, 1987), p. 31 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fXjRc4yYNukC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Geefs+%22l'ange+du+mal%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BIcV1lrjSm&amp;sig=aAPWtgr24fiqCliOw-0QG7U5Cgc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UTL6Sb_GB5LQMu643NQE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#PPA31,M1 online], with the painting reproduced on p. 32.

''L'ange du mal'' was not uniformly admired even as a work of art. When it appeared in an 1862 international exhibition, the reviewer criticized Geefs' work as "gentle and languid" and lacking in "muscle", "a devil sick... : the sting of Satan is taken out."&lt;ref&gt;J. Beavington Atkinson, "Modern Sculpture of All Nations in the Exhibition," ''The Art Journal Illustrated Catalogue of the International Exhibition 1862'' p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the [[Vesper bat|vespertilionid]] wings, the fallen angel of Joseph Geefs&lt;ref&gt;In Dutch and German sources, the artist's name may appear as Jozef Geefs.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a completely human form, made manifest by its [[Depictions of nudity|artistic near-nudity]].

The torso is fit but youthful; smooth and graceful, almost [[androgynous]]. The angel's expression has been described as "serious, somber, even fierce,"&lt;ref&gt;''500 chefs-d'oeuvre de l'art belge'' p. 203.

The most obvious satanic element in addition to the wings is the [[Serpents in the Bible|snake]] uncoiling across the base of the rock. ''L'ange du mal'' has been called "one of the most disturbing works of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, 19th-century sculpture collection [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/EN/frames/F_sculpture.html online introduction.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624003318/http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/EN/frames/F_sculpture.html |date=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph's sculptures are "striking for their perfect finish and grace, their elegant and even poetic line," but while exhibiting these qualities in abundance, ''L'ange du mal'' is exceptional within the artist's body of work for its subject matter:&lt;ref&gt;''500 chefs-d'oeuvre de l'art belge'' p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chained genius==
[[File:Lucifer of Liège (foot detail) by Viatour.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Detail of '''''Le génie du mal''''': chained ankle, tasted apple, broken sceptre ''(from photo by Luc Viatour)'']]

Without a statement from the artist, it can only be surmised that Guillaume Geefs sought to address specific criticisms leveled at his brother Joseph's work. Guillaume's ''génie'' shows less flesh, and is marked more strongly by satanic [[iconography]] as neither human nor angelic. Whether Guillaume succeeded in removing the "seductive" elements may be a matter of individual perception.

[[File:Lucifer of Liège (horns detail) Viatour.jpg|thumb|Horns, and a collocation of human and animal anatomy (detail)]]
[[File:Horned Moses (detail).jpg|thumb|[[Moses#Figurative art|Horned Moses]]]]Guillaume shifts the direction of the fallen angel's gaze so that it leads away from the body, and his Lucifer's knees are drawn together protectively. The drapery hangs from behind the right shoulder, pools on the right side, and undulates thickly over the thighs, concealing the hips, not quite covering the navel. At the same time, the flesh that remains exposed is resolutely modeled, particularly in the upper arms, pectorals, and calves, to reveal a more defined, muscled masculinity. The uplifted right arm allows the artist to explore the patterned tensions of the [[serratus anterior muscle]]s, and the gesture and the angle of the head suggest that the ''génie'' is warding off "divine chastisement".&lt;ref&gt;Geuzaine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols of Lucifer===
Guillaume added several details to enhance the Luciferian iconography and the theme of punishment: at the angel's feet, the dropped "[[forbidden fruit]]", an [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]] with bite marks, along with the broken-off tip of the sceptre, the stellar [[finial]] of which marks [[Lucifer#Latin name for the Morning Star|Lucifer as the Morning Star of classical tradition]]. The [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are narrow and elongated, like talons.&lt;ref&gt;Geuzaine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of horns may be intended to further dehumanize the figure, while introducing another note of [[ambiguity]]. Horns are animalistic markers of the satanic or demonic, but in a parallel tradition of religious iconography, "horns" represent points of light. Gods from antiquity who personify celestial phenomena such as the Sun or stars are crowned with rays, and some depictions of [[Moses]], the most famous being that of [[Michelangelo]], are carved with "horns" similar to those of Geefs' Lucifer; see [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Horned Moses]].

===Promethean Lucifer===
[[File:Prometheus Bound (Paul Bouré).jpg|thumb|left|230px|A bronze ''Prometheus Bound'' (1845) by Belgian artist [[Paul Bouré]], who once studied with Guillaume Geefs]]
But the most apparent departure from ''L'ange du mal'' is the placing of Lucifer in &lt;!--the following link to a disambiguation page is deliberate, as a full range of meaning should apply--&gt;[[bondage (disambiguation)|bondage]], with his right ankle and left wrist chained. In 19th-century reinterpretations of [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] and [[Christian mythology|Christian myths]], Lucifer was often cast as a [[Prometheus|Promethean]] figure, drawing on a tradition that the fallen angel was chained in [[Hell]] just as the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] had been chained and [[Torture#Torture in the past|tortured]] on the rock by [[Zeus]]: "The same [[Prometheus]] who is taken as an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified Christ]] is regarded also as a type of Lucifer," wrote [[Harold Bloom]] in remarks on [[Mary Shelley]]'s 19th-century classic ''[[Frankenstein]]'', subtitled ''The Modern Prometheus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]], 1965 afterword republished in the Signet Classic 2000 edition of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', p. 201 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gBJbpHyFf7MC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=%22The+same+Prometheus+who+is+taken+as+an+analogue+of+the+crucified+Christ+is+regarded+also+as+a+type+of+Lucifer%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] The literature on the connection between Lucifer and Prometheus made in 19th-century art and literature is vast.

Guillaume Geefs' addition of fetters, with the swagged chain replacing the sneering serpent in Joseph's version, displays the angel's defeat in pious adherence to Christian ideology.

The Belgians had just secured their own "liberation"; over the ensuing two decades, there had been a craze for public sculpture, by the Geefs brothers and others, that celebrated the leaders of independence. The magnificently human figure of the iconic rebel who failed might have been expected to elicit a complex or ambivalent response.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Museum of Fine Arts, [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/EN/frames/F_sculpture.html "Romanticism."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624003318/http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/site/EN/frames/F_sculpture.html |date=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suffering face of the ''génie'', stripped of the angry hauteur of ''L'ange du mal'', has been read as expressing remorse and despair; a tear slips from the left eye.&lt;ref&gt;Geuzine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister of angels==
[[File:Lucifer of Liège (tear detail) LucViatour.jpg|thumb|The tear of Lucifer (detail of ''Le génie du mal'')]]
In a 1990 essay, Belgian art historian [[:fr:Jacques Lennep|Jacques Van Lennep]] discussed how the conception of ''Le génie du mal'' was influenced by [[Alfred de Vigny]]'s long philosophical poem ''[[Éloa, ou La sœur des anges]]'' ("Eloa, or the Sister of Angels"), published in 1824, which explored the possibility of Lucifer's redemption through love.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lennep.be/principale.htm Jacques Van Lennep] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531121201/http://www.lennep.be/principale.htm |date=2009-05-31 }}, ''La Sculpture belge au xixe siècle, exposition organisée à Bruxelles du 5 octobre au 15 décembre 1990, La Générale de banque, Bruxelles'' (Exhibition catalogue, 1990), as cited by Geuzaine and Creusen, ''Vers la modernité''. Although in origin Lucifer and Satan may be distinct beings, ''Eloa'' draws on a literary tradition that [[conflation|conflates]] the two figures. {{cite web |url=http://www.lennep.be/principale.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531121201/http://www.lennep.be/principale.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this "lush and lyrical" narrative poem, Lucifer sets out to seduce the beautiful Eloa, an angel born from a tear shed by [[Christ]] at the death of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]. The Satanic lover is "literally a handsome devil, physically dashing, intellectually agile, irresistibly charismatic in speech and manner": in short, a [[Romantic hero]]. "Since you are so beautiful," the naïve Eloa says, "you are no doubt good."

Lucifer declares that "I am he whom one loves and does not know,"&lt;ref&gt;In French, ''Je suis celui qu'on aime et qu'on ne connaît pas.''&lt;/ref&gt; and says he weeps for the powerless and grants them the occasional reprieve of delight or oblivion. Despite Eloa's attempt to reconcile him with God, Lucifer cannot set aside his destructive pride. In the end, Eloa's love condemns her to Hell with Lucifer, and his triumph over her only brings him sadness.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cheresh Allen, ''A Fallen Idol Is Still a God: [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]] and the Quandaries of Cultural Transition'' (Stanford University Press, 2007), pp. 89–90 [https://books.google.com/books?id=C0SsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22One+of+these+incarnations+appeared+in+Alfred+de+Vigny%27s+Eloa%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; Miriam Van Scott, ''The Encyclopedia of Hell'' (Macmillan, 1999), p. 103 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I9QNUhT4besC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22sœur+des+anges%22+%22Alfred+de+Vigny%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z0LByqY6Bw&amp;sig=Ns9vq2M-OuCYLr0u65KW2bSS41U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QT_-SaKmFYieMtiwoLEE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=16 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Himmelsweg''==
:''A version of'' Himmelsweg ''by Jacques Charlier may be viewed''
In 1986, the Belgian artist [[:fr:Jacques Charlier|Jacques Charlier]] made ''Le génie du mal'' a focal point of his [[Installation art|installation]] ''Himmelsweg'' ("The Road to Paradise"). A framed photograph of the sculpture hangs over a slender pedestal table that is draped with a black cloth. A transparent case on the table contains three books: a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] study on the subject of [[Satan]], a scientific treatise on [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], and a memorial of the [[History of the Jews in Belgium|Belgian Jews]] killed at [[Auschwitz]]. On the lower shelf of the table are [[shackles]].

Charlier has described his use of ''Le génie du mal'' as "a Romantic image that speaks to us of [[seduction]], [[evil]], and the [[sin]] of forgetting." The German title of the work refers to the [[Nazi]] euphemism or "cold joke" for the access ramp that led to the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]: "The Road to Paradise leads to Hell; [[Fall of Man|the Fall]] is so close to [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nadja Vilenne galerie, ''[http://www.nadjavilenne.com/charlier_esprit.htm Himmelsweg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704054747/http://www.nadjavilenne.com/charlier_esprit.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}'', with artist interview conducted by R.Vandersanden; gallery news blogged by Jean-Michel Botquin, English [http://blog.nadjavilenne.com/dotclear/index.php?2008/03 version], 13 March 2008.

[[Image:Jouffret.gif|right|thumb|An illustration from Jouffret's ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions''. The book, which influenced Picasso, was given to him by Princet.]]
Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princet brought to Picasso's attention a book by [[Esprit Jouffret]], ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's sketchbooks for ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=106–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Princet's wife left him for [[André Derain]], and he drifted away from the circle of artists at the Bateau-Lavoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Robbin |title=Shadows of Reality, The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-11039-1 |pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Princet remained close to Metzinger and participated in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the group, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet's influence on the cubists was attested to by his contemporaries. [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] wrote, "I witnessed the birth of cubism, its growth, its decline. Picasso was the obstetrician, Guillaume Apollinaire the midwife, Princet the godfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlaminck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice de Vlaminck |date=June 6, 1942 |title=Opinions libres... sur la peinture |journal=Comédia |pages=1, 6 |quote=J'ai assisté à la naissance du cubisme, à sa croissance, à son déclin.

In 1910, Metzinger said of him, "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |location=Paris |isbn= |pages=43–44 }} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Louis Vauxcelles]] sarcastically dubbed Princet "the father of cubism":
&lt;blockquote&gt;M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak rather carelessly. Now then, M. Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious M. Picasso of it, and M. Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. M. Picasso explained his intentions to M. Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vauxcelles |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Vauxcelles |date=December 29, 1918 |title=Le Carnet des ateliers: La Père du cubisme |journal=Le Carnet de la semaine |pages=11 }} in {{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Linda Dalrymple |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-10142-6 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duchamp told Pierre Cabanne, "We weren't mathematicians at all, but we really did believe in Princet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cabanne |first=Pierre  |title=Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp |year=1971 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |pages=39 }} in {{cite book |last=Crunden |first=Robert Morse |title=American Salons: Encounters with European Modernism, 1885-1917 |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-506569-7 |pages=431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Gustavius Payne''' (born 1969) is a Welsh [[Figurative art|figurative painter]]. He paints primarily in [[Oil painting|oils]] and is influenced by mythological themes within a contemporary context.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wakelin, Focus on Wales, Art Review, pp.&amp;nbsp;57 – 58 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Hanna (2000) Religions &amp; Myths Inspire Collection, [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]], p.&amp;nbsp;10. (16.10.00)&lt;/ref&gt; During his early exhibiting career he was known as '''Michael Payne''', before he began using his full name. Since late 2012 he has dropped his first name and now uses the shorter '''Gustavius Payne'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgpayne.com/Pages/default.aspx|title=Gustavius Payne|publisher=Mgpayne.com|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshart.net/display_artist.php?art_id=132|title=Gustavius Payne - Welsh Art - Ffin y Parc Gallery|publisher=Welshart.net|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Payne was born in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and raised on the town's [[Gurnos]] estate during the mid-1970s until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="1993 interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00fffqn/broadcasts/1993/08|title=BBC One - The Slate  - Episodes by date, August 1993|work=BBC|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2013}} During 1991–1993, he attended the Mid Glamorgan Centre of Art &amp; Design Technology, [[Pontypridd]], where he won the Student of The Year Award at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], prompting the [[BBC]] arts programme ''The Slate'' to include an article about the artist on their ''Eisteddfod Special'' in 1993, shown initially on [[BBC1 Wales]] and also, shortly after throughout the UK, on [[BBC2]].&lt;ref name="1993 interview" /&gt; During 1993–1996, he studied at [[University of Gloucestershire#Campuses, faculties and courses|Cheltenham School of Art]], where he gained a First Class [[Bachelor of Arts|BA Honors]] degree in fine art painting.&lt;ref name="WMail 1997"&gt;McLean, Pauline (1997), "Drawing on Myths &amp; Legends – With A Dog on the Loose", ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', 24 May 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at [[Cheltenham]], Payne was granted a place on the [[ERASMUS programme]] at the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]]. Upon completion of his degree at Cheltenham he won the [[Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society]]'s Art Purchase Prize, before returning to Wales to live initially in [[Cardiff]],&lt;ref name="WMail 1997" /&gt; then later in [[Dowlais]].&lt;ref name="Ellis, Geraint 2008"&gt;Ellis, Geraint (Director) (2008), Sioe Gelf, episode 14, Cwmni Da, first broadcast (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] but with English subtitles available) 05/11/08 on [[S4C]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Recent work has drawn reference to Welsh culture, globalisation and expolitation. His 2011 joint exhibition with poet [[Mike Jenkins (poet)|Mike Jenkins]] used a common political theme, with the traditional [[Miner's canary#Miner.27s canary|coal miners' canary]] as a symbol of exploitation of the 'little guy', as well as the exploitation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2011/08/19/a-mine-of-information-91466-29266079/ "A Mine of Information"], [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mai]] (supplement), 10 August 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ecological and socialist themes can also be seen in more recent exhibitions&lt;ref name="barryanddistrictnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/leisure/10742497.Art_Central_Gallery_exhibition___Gustavius_Payne___39_The_Cause_and_Effect_Hypothesis__39_/|title=Art Central Gallery exhibition - Gustavius Payne 'The Cause and Effect Hypothesis'|work=Barry And District News|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with his painting "Our Very Own Eco-System" held in the [[University of South Wales]] collection,&lt;ref name="Paintings"&gt;{{Art UK bio|retrieved=21 November 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his cover illustration for ''Red Poets #19'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etomagazine.com/red-poets-launch/|title='RED  POETS'  LAUNCH - eto welsh fiction|work=eto welsh fiction|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miranda''''' was a British television [[sitcom]] written by and starring comedian [[Miranda Hart]]. It originally aired on [[BBC Two]] from 9 November 2009 and later on [[BBC One]]. 
Developed from Hart's semi-autobiographical [[BBC Radio 2]] comedy ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' (2008), the situation comedy revolves around socially inept Miranda, who frequently finds herself in awkward situations.  The show features actors [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], [[Patricia Hodge]], [[Sally Phillips]], [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] and [[Bo Poraj]]. It was filmed in front of live audiences at the [[BBC Television Centre]] and [[The London Studios]].

Receiving positive comments from critics, ''Miranda'' won a [[Royal Television Society]] award and gained several [[BAFTA TV Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="Sally"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6794548.ece|title=The best television for autumn 2009|last=Kinnes|first=Sally|work=[[Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6898506.ece|title=Miranda Hart stands head and shoulders above the rest|last=Maxwell|first=Dominic|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mean vicky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|title=Miranda: you are awful, but I like you|last=Frost|first=Vicky|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922201136/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has since been regularly repeated on British television and is available in the United States through [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/miranda|title=Hulu: Watch Miranda online|publisher=[[Hulu]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630032639/http://www.hulu.com/miranda|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
{{main|List of Miranda episodes}}

The episodes revolve around the difficulties Miranda ([[Miranda Hart]]) gets herself into. She is {{convert|6|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and, sometimes mistaken for a man, is addressed as 'Sir'. She has never fit in with her old boarding school friends, Tilly ([[Sally Phillips]]) and Fanny ([[Katy Wix]]), and finds social situations awkward, especially around men. She is a constant disappointment to her mother, Penny ([[Patricia Hodge]]), who is desperate for her to get a proper job and a husband. Although Miranda owns and lives above her own [[wikt:joke shop|joke shop]] and [[boutique]], she lacks any real capacity for business, so it is managed by her childhood friend Stevie Sutton ([[Sarah Hadland]]). The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans ([[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]]), until series three, when the restaurant's chef, Gary Preston ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), purchases it from him. After many failed attempts at dating, Miranda and Gary, a friend from university whom Miranda fancies, decide to be just friends. Nevertheless, when Gary gets a girlfriend called Rose ([[Naomi Bentley]]), it prompts Miranda to start a new relationship with Michael Jackford ([[Bo Poraj]]), a local reporter whose work soon takes him to Africa. Upon his return he proposes to Miranda, as does Gary when he realises his love for her. Miranda accepts Gary's proposal rather than Michael's and Miranda and Gary get married in the final episode.

* [[Miranda Hart]] as Miranda – An ungainly, socially awkward, 35-year-old woman who frequently finds herself in bizarre situations.&lt;ref name="Miranda at www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|title=Miranda at BBC.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123064515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is something of a misfit relative to her upper-middle-class, privately educated background, opting to invest an inheritance from her uncle in a joke/gift shop rather than pursuing what her mother perceives as a more "respectable" career, and balking at the supposedly "suitable" men that her mother and friends try to set her up with. Miranda struggles with everyday adult life, often indulging in odd, childlike behaviour (including adding faces and clothes to pieces of fruit and vegetables, dubbing them "Fruit Friends" and "Vegeta-Pals") and getting thrown out of numerous establishments. Although this often irritates her friends and family, they tolerate her because, at heart, she is intelligent and good-natured, despite not always showing it. In the final episode, after she breaks up with Gary, some of her awkward and childish behaviour disappears; this causes considerable concern for her friends and mother, who organise a therapy session. However, she finally accepts that her only serious problem – her lack of confidence – is now gone and although she does not need Gary, she does indeed love him. After an initial panic over an unexpected wedding, she marries Gary at his restaurant.
* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as Gary Preston – A handsome, friendly chef; an old university friend of Miranda's. Although there has always been an undercurrent of attraction between them, neither has pursued it until he begins working at the restaurant next to Miranda's shop. Despite often being confused by Miranda's behaviour, Gary generally finds her kind, open nature endearing, especially as she is willing to help him out when needed. Gary is more confident and worldly than Miranda, but he shares her insecurity in romantic situations, and occasionally becomes embroiled in odd situations with her {{mdash}} for example, the pretence that they have sons called "Cliff" and "Richard" when challenged by a customer in the shop. He is one of the few people who accepts Miranda as she is. Miranda and Gary date briefly in series two, though this breaks down when it is revealed Gary was married (for a green card) to a waitress that Miranda had befriended at the restaurant. Gary also dates Rose briefly in series three, before breaking up with her due to her being unable to accept Miranda. After becoming engaged, Miranda becomes concerned that he has never said he loves her. When she confronts him, Gary tells Miranda that her distinctive lack of confidence in herself means that they can never truly be together. In the final episode, when Miranda accepts herself, she rushes to what she believes is Gary's wedding, where he is actually best man for his former boss Clive. Gary reveals he has already decided that he loves Miranda and offers to elope; she decides that she does not need to run away and marries Gary at Clive's reception.
* [[Sarah Hadland]] as Stevie Sutton – Miranda's childhood friend, and the assistant manager of the joke shop (although in reality she does most of the work due to Miranda's lack of business sense). She is generally more level-headed and ambitious than Miranda, but is not averse to becoming involved in her strange behaviour, or indeed indulging in some of her own, including frequently performing [[Heather Small]]'s "[[Proud (Heather Small song)|Proud]]" while holding a cardboard cut-out of the singer whenever she is pleased with herself.&lt;ref name="Miranda -"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|title=Miranda – Stevie sings "Proud" on YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215114105/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Miranda and Stevie often get into petty arguments and competitions, such as when a customer leaves his wallet and both Miranda and Stevie attempt to impress him. Miranda frequently mocks Stevie for her small stature, and frequently pushes her over when she irritates Miranda. Despite often claiming to have "the allure" and mocking Miranda's attempts with men, Stevie also shares Miranda's lack of success, sometimes coming across as desperate when she chats someone up. She occasionally uses an unkempt and unpleasant traffic warden (played by [[Joe Wilkinson]]) as a date when trying to compete with Miranda. In the final episode, the traffic warden appears again and Stevie kisses him to avoid getting a [[parking ticket]].
* [[Patricia Hodge]] as Penny – Miranda's middle-class mother, a "lady who lunches", who likes to impress her friends and fellow [[Women's Institutes|W.I.]] members. Her main mission in life is to find Miranda a man and a better job. She despairs at Miranda's decision to run a joke/gift shop, and her tendency to reject suitable (or at least available) men, on numerous occasions trying to set up Miranda with her cousin. Although often embarrassed by her daughter, Penny displays many of Miranda's erratic traits and often teams up with Miranda for their benefit, such as when they are in the psychiatrist's office. Despite being prepared to humiliate Miranda for her own gain (to the point of holding up a placard offering to pay someone to marry Miranda), Penny's actions are borne out of genuine love and concern, and on the rare occasions where Miranda is doing well she shows her love by cheering "Go Miranda". Penny's catchphrase, "Such fun!" is normally used to describe an activity or event where she believes Miranda may find a husband. Another catchphrase of Penny's, especially in the first series, is 'What I call', which she says before numerous everyday things before Miranda points out that that is simply the word for it, and not just what Penny calls it (for example, 'I'm meeting a friend for a spot of, what I call, tea.') Penny tends to ignore Miranda's obvious disinterest or discomfort. &lt;!-- When two men proposes to Miranda at once in the final episode of series three, Penny desperately screams "just say YES!", not even caring at this point which man she says it to.&lt;ref name="Miranda - proposal scene @ YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7EOmCd0kn0|title=Miranda – proposal scene}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;  In the final episode, Penny turns up at Miranda's flat two days after her break-up with Gary, insensitively suggesting they simply find another groom. Miranda finally loses her temper and tells Penny to get out; this causes Penny to go on a drinking binge at her local tennis club. She soon turns up at Miranda's flat and tearfully confesses that her relationship with Miranda's father has been dead for some time. Thanks to her daughter's new confidence, Penny regains her dignity and joyfully embraces Miranda when she marries Gary several days later.
* [[Sally Phillips]] as Tilly – An old school friend of Miranda's and the daughter of Penny's never-seen friend Belinda, who fits right in with their private school background, often showing more in common with Penny than Miranda does. Tilly is a socialite and normally quite self-centred, though on occasion, she does come through for her friends and shows that she is kind and generous. She will often address Miranda by her school nickname, "Queen Kong" (due to Miranda's stature and clumsiness), despite Miranda's displeasure, but her criticisms and attempts to help Miranda are generally well intentioned. Tilly's catchphrase is "bear with", usually said as she breaks off conversations to read text messages. While seeming more confident and together than Miranda, she has her own problems romantically, particularly when her fiancé, Rupert (played by [[Adam James (actor)|Adam James]]), makes a pass at Miranda behind her back. In the penultimate episode, she becomes engaged to her army doctor boyfriend, "Dreamboat" Charlie (played by [[Adrian Scarborough]]). The final episode sees Miranda give Tilly tickets to [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] so she can be free of her mother and elope with Charlie.
* [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] as Clive Evans (2009–2010, 2015) – The [[camp (style)|camp]], vicious-tongued owner of the restaurant where Gary works. He is usually more of a hindrance than help whenever he attempts to help Miranda and Gary get together, accidentally revealing, for example, that Gary has a secret wife from [[Hong Kong]] named Tamara (played by [[Stacy Liu]]). Despite his jibes at Miranda, he does show traits of wanting to help her, such as when he pushes her to tell Gary his true feelings. He is absent from the third series having sold the restaurant to Gary off-screen. Clive returns in the final episode and marries the regular customer from previous episodes (played by [[Dominic Coleman]]).
* [[Bo Poraj]] as Michael Jackford (2012–2014) – Miranda's new boyfriend who works as a television reporter and loves Miranda for the real her. Michael made his final appearance in the penultimate episode, when Miranda peacefully turned down his marriage proposal in order to accept Gary's. In the final episode, Penny mentions that the character has flown to Africa, where he had previously returned from on a business venture.
* [[Naomi Bentley]] as Rose (2013) – Gary's new girlfriend. When Rose can't accept his past affections for Miranda, Gary breaks up with her. She is last seen entering Gary's restaurant for its re-opening, but when Miranda confesses her true feelings for Gary during an argument, Rose immediately walks out.
* [[Katy Wix]] as Fanny (2009) – Another socialite friend of Miranda's from boarding school. She appears during the first series&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|title=Katy Wix|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802075340/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|archivedate=2 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Tilly, but is not mentioned or seen as of the second series.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
* [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] and [[Margaret Cabourn-Smith]] as Chris and Alison (2009–2010, 2013–2014) – Sort-of friends of Gary and Miranda. As university students, Chris and Alison agreed to marry each other if they were still single at a certain age, but Chris whisked Alison away to Paris and proposed. During the second series, Alison becomes pregnant and they decide that Gary and Miranda should be godparents, but Miranda freaks out when they reveal she will also act as Alison's birthing partner. In the third series, Miranda, Gary and Rose babysit for them. They make their final appearance in the penultimate episode; their once joyous marriage now strained.
* [[Dominic Coleman]] (2009, 2013, 2015) as 'Customer' – A [[homosexual|gay]] man who comes into the store on three occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|title=Dominic Coleman|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071035/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with the intention of buying something for his niece, but is distracted by the probing questions of Stevie and Miranda and gets roped into their antics (For example, suggesting Miranda should lie about being gay and then being roped into attending her coming out party.) He features in the final episode as the partner of Clive,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|title=BBC One – Miranda, Specials, The Final Curtain|work=BBC|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426011643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose wedding Miranda gatecrashes. Although never mentioned on screen, he is referred to on the BBC's website as 'Jim'.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===

Abigail Wilson, who worked for comedians [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]], suggested Hart pitch a show to the BBC after seeing her perform in 2003.&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Following a read-through of her script with Saunders and BBC executives,&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; a television pilot, based on her semi-autobiographical writing, was filmed in early 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|title=BBC Comedy Blog: Get ready for ''Miranda''|last=Hart|first=Miranda|authorlink=Miranda Hart|date=9 November 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228151534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|archivedate=28 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series was then developed into a sitcom for radio;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' aired on [[BBC Radio 2]] in August and September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|title=''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop''|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624120548/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|archivedate=24 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television series was commissioned in August 2008 and began filming in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|title=New BBC Two comedy: ''In My Country'' starring Omid Djalili, ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' and ''Rab C Nesbitt'' returns|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106023056/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|title=Miranda starts filming with an all-star cast for her new sitcom on BBC Two|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=3 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622192932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|archivedate=22 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor shots for series one were filmed in Hounslow, West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miranda |last=Hart |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |title=Comedy Blog: Get ready for Miranda |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102221505/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the BBC's Writersroom, Hart said of the semi-autobiographical basis for the series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well I developed this stand-up persona, and that's where it all started from. I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me, and that's what ended up in the sitcom. You do ultimately start from yourself but I'm pleased to say I did have to exaggerate for comedic effect. It wasn't entirely autobiographical. I'm not quite that mad.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|title=Miranda Hart|date=December 2009|work=BBC Writersroom|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213204628/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Series 1 (2009) ===

Each episode begins with a welcome to audience and a 'Previously in my life ...' segment, and Hart says a joke shop is the "right place" as the setting after being asked to consider an office to "normalise" the character.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"/&gt; Her love of 1970s comedy programmes, such as ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', is the influence for ''Miranda''. The episodes end with a 'You have been watching ...' credits section where each cast member waves goodbye, as seen concluding [[Jimmy Perry]] and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] sitcoms such as ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|title=Miranda Hart harks back to TV golden age|work=Chester Chronicle|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Andy|last=Welch|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227075127/http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|archivedate=27 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted in ''[[The Times]]'', Hart says "I'm saying this is what I'm doing and I'm not scared to do it. Some of my comedy peers do slightly fear being a mainstream figure, as if it's slightly uncool. Well, I thought I'm going to embrace it."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Throughout each episode, Hart breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience directly, a technique described as a "simple creative decision [that] makes this infectious comedy sing";&lt;ref name=4th&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press/|title=Miranda – Reviews and Articles – British Comedy Guide|publisher=The British Comedy Guide|accessdate=31 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114065806/http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press|archivedate=14 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; another critic stated "this is hard to pull off, but it works well".&lt;ref name = 4th/&gt;

=== Series 2 (2010) ===

Following the conclusion of the first series, the BBC commissioned a second series for BBC Two in 2010.&lt;ref name="Hands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a191479/bbc-hands-second-series-to-miranda.html|title=BBC hands second series to ''Miranda''|last=French|first=Dan|date=15 December 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=15 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223180139/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a191479/bbc-hands-second-series-to-miranda.html|archivedate=23 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, Hart said "I am not only relieved but totally overwhelmed by the response and thrilled that people have enjoyed the series.

''Miranda'' was recommissioned for a third series by BBC Comedy commissioner Cheryl Taylor in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a297773/bbc-hands-miranda-a-third-run.html|title=BBC hands 'Miranda' a third run|first=Ryan|last=Love|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115192923/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a297773/bbc-hands-miranda-a-third-run.html|archivedate=15 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart revealed that the third series might not be ready until 2012, but she may write a Christmas special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a299722/miranda-new-series-could-air-in-2012.html|title=Miranda: 'New series could air in 2012'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Ryan|last=Love|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month it was announced that the third series of ''Miranda'' would be shown on [[BBC One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/10/upstairs-downstairs-miranda-bbc1|title=Upstairs Downstairs gets second series as Miranda moves to BBC1|last=Deans|first=Jason|date=10 February 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=10 February 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111141903/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/10/upstairs-downstairs-miranda-bbc1|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Hart announced on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' that she had set herself to start writing the third series the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 3|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010vd3m|series=The Graham Norton Show|serieslink=The Graham Norton Show|credits=Norton, Graham, Hart, Miranda, Adele, Whitehall, Jack|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=29 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012154008/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010vd3m|archivedate=12 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hart revealed in November she had still not started writing the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=04/11/2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vx2w|series=The One Show|serieslink=The One Show|credits=Evans Chris, Jones, Alex, Hart, Miranda|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=4 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106052539/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vx2w|archivedate=6 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month it was announced Hart would not be doing a new Christmas special, though the 2010 Christmas episode would be repeated on BBC One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirandahart.com/?p=461|title=Christmas TV appearances|publisher=Mirandahart.com|accessdate=1 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112153355/http://mirandahart.com/?p=461|archivedate=12 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specials (2014–2015) ===
Due to the cliffhanger at the end of the third series, it was suspected that ''Miranda'' would return for a fourth series. However, in July 2014, Hart announced that there are no plans for a fourth series but 'a couple of specials' would be made.&lt;ref name=specials/&gt; Hart later announced that the two Christmas specials would be the end to the sitcom. Hart said the end was "going to be really emotional," but added that she didn't want her sitcom character "to keep falling over and making a fool of herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|title=Miranda Hart confirms an end to her hit sitcom|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024171214/http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
At the end of the final episode, Miranda said to the audience/viewers: "I don't know when and if I'll see you again..." In June 2015, Miranda Hart revealed that she hadn't ruled out a possible return for ''Miranda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/582430/Miranda-Hart-return-Tom-Ellis-Gary-sitcom|title=Miranda Hart is not ruling out sitcom return with children – TV &amp; Radio – Showbiz &amp; TV – Daily Express|author=Neela Debnath|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Hadland has suggested that the sitcom is set to return. Speaking in an interview with The Telegraph, the actress – who plays Miranda's friend Stevie in the show – confirmed that the comedy will be back "in some format". However, she wouldn't be drawn on specifics, just saying: "I can say there will be something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|title=Sarah Hadland: 'Miranda is coming back'|author=Jasper Rees|access-date=4 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104210326/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2017, Tom Ellis suggested the possibility of future episodes in an interview on [[BBC Radio 2]], saying that "we may be revisiting Miranda in the next couple of years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|title=Miranda is to make a shock return two years after the hit comedy's 'finale' saw character marry Gary|date=2017-06-01|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603065425/https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|archivedate=3 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cast of ''Miranda'' (aside from Ellis and Holmes), reunited for the 2017 [[Royal Variety Performance]], for which Hart was the host. They appeared several times throughout the evening in character.

==American remake==
In August 2018, it was reported that ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' star [[Jim Parsons]] was developing a US remake for [[Warner Bros. Television]]. Hart would be involved in developing the remake as a producer, but it was not revealed if she would star as well. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/08/miranda-jim-parsons-developing-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The first series was picked as one of the top 10 forthcoming TV shows for Autumn 2009 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Sally" /&gt; Ahead of the first episode airing, Dominic Maxwell in an article for ''[[The Times]]'' described it as an "old-school" sitcom and said that "It's good fun, if you buy into it. And if you do, it's because of Hart."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Also describing it as "old-fashioned", Vicky Frost for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said of the [[slapstick]] physical comedy that "It's not clever – but it is funny. And that, I think is at the heart of Miranda's appeal."&lt;ref name="mean vicky" /&gt; Mark Wright for ''[[The Stage]]'' said that Hodge gives a "brilliant, brilliant performance" and that "what sets ''Miranda'' out as something special is Hart herself, and the rest just gels around her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/11/why-we-love-miranda/|title=Why We Love ''Miranda''|last=Wright|first=Mark|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126050107/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/11/why-we-love-miranda/|archivedate=26 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series opened with 2.63&amp;nbsp;million viewers (10% audience share), rising to 3.14&amp;nbsp;million viewers (12% share) for the fourth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes – BBC2 w/e 15 Nov 2009|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLX6Azh?url=http://www.barb.co.uk/report/weeklyTopProgrammesOverview|archivedate=13 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes – BBC2 w/e 6 Dec 2009|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLX6Azh?url=http://www.barb.co.uk/report/weeklyTopProgrammesOverview|archivedate=13 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonight was also the first we saw of Miranda's father, played by Tom Conti, who filled most of the episode's falling-over quota, so that Miranda finally remained pretty vertical throughout the episode."&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; She added that Hart is "a great observer of everyday dilemmas" and the best thing of all is she left the door open for a third series.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; Dominic Cavendish of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ''Miranda'' "the sitcom of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|title=Miranda: 'I'm the friend you can laugh at'|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=21 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228032950/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|archivedate=28 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chris Harvey of the same newspaper said "The truth is, pretty much every time Miranda turns and looks at the camera, I burst out laughing.

[[File:Horseshoe Falls, Niagara Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumb|The final study for the painting. ''Horseshoe Falls, Niagara'', 1856–57, oil on two pieces of paper, 29.2 × 90.5 cm. [[Olana State Historic Site]]&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt;]]

'''''Niagara''''' is an oil painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. ''Niagara'' was his most important work to date, and confirmed his reputation as the premier American landscape painter of the time.&lt;ref name="olana"/&gt; In his history of Niagara Falls, [[Pierre Berton]] writes, "Of the hundreds of paintings made of Niagara, before Church and after him, this is by common consent the greatest."&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;

==Background==
The Falls were commonly painted, being such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were "the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting".&lt;ref name="h69"&gt;Howat, 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the public was captivated by the natural wonder of the Falls, considered a landmark of the North American landscape and a major tourist destination. It was the "Honeymoon Capital of the World", and prints of Niagara were given as wedding gifts. In the 1850s, Niagara was the subject of millions of [[stereograph]]s, and its image could be found on wallpaper, china, and lamp shades, among other consumer items.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt;  In 1853, a 1600-foot [[moving panorama]] of Niagara Falls was exhibited in New York City.&lt;ref name="olana"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;pg=PA69 |title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church |last=Church |first=Frederic Edwin |last2=Avery |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Pataki |first3=George E. |date=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0801444306 |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Americans, the Falls symbolized the grandeur and expansionism of the United States. David C. Huntington, whose writing on Church in the 1960s revived interest in the painter, explained how Americans, in an era of spiritual optimism and [[manifest destiny]], would have perceived such a vivid painting of Niagara, with all that it symbolized:

{{quote|Church presented his fellow-men with the "soul" and "spirit" of Niagara, this "most suggestive" of nature's spectacles: this archetype of the universe. ''Niagara'' is the substance of a great American metaphor; indeed, for its original viewers, a certain something more than a metaphor.... Nature and its Bible, the Science of Design, would unfold the transcendent truth of the universe to the New Chosen People in the New World. Nature in the Era of Manifest Destiny was prophecy, and Church as the "interpreter" of Niagara was therefore painting as American prophet.

''Niagara'' is the American's mythical Deluge which washes away the memory of an Old World so that man may live at home in a New World. The painting is an icon of psychic natural purgation and rebirth. Poetically a New World emerges as the waters of a flood subside. The rainbow, sign of the "God of Nature's" covenant with man, transfixes the beholder.... ''Niagara'' is a revelation of the cosmos to each and every man. Before this greatest of American landscapes the self-reliant, democratic American becomes his own prophet: he stands and sees as a New Noah. Thus through the work of art did Mr. Church help his fellow-men to discover themselves in their New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church: Vision of an American Era |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1966 |publisher=George Braziller |lccn=66-16675 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Church studied Niagara Falls extensively leading up to 1857, making dozens of pencil and oil [[study (art)|studies]]. In 1856 Church visited the Falls for probably the fifth time.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt; His teacher [[Thomas Cole]] had also visited the Falls. A writer in ''Art and Artists in Connecticut'' (1879) reported that the painting itself took about six weeks, and that Church used two similar canvases simultaneously: a "draft" upon which he tested a painting idea, and the final canvas, to which he transferred the results he found satisfactory.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt;

==Description==
Church's painting is of [[Horseshoe Falls]], the largest and most iconic of Niagara's three waterfalls. With a width of {{convert|2.3|m}}, it is more than twice as wide as it is high. The canvas's unusual proportions allowed him to paint a panoramic view from the Canadian side of the falls; the composition leads the eye laterally. The vantage point was dramatic and unique, leaving behind the "canonical banality" of many other paintings before it,&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; the merely picturesque, and immersing the viewer directly in the scene, as if airborne or even in the water. The lack of a ''[[repoussoir]]'' aids this effect. Before the advent of modern photography, which made such images common, this was a revelation.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"&gt;Berton, 73–77&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Niagara'' is highly naturalistic, more so than Church's previous ''[[The Andes of Ecuador]]'' (1855), and shows the influence of [[John Ruskin]]'s aesthetics on Church.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt; Church brings the viewer to the lip of the falls, highlighting the impressive drop by painting in streams of water and cloudy mists.&lt;ref name="Revie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Revie, Linda L. |title=The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists, and Writers at the Falls, from Discovery through the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNJ0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |date=2006 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-635-9 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only foreground object is a floating tree trunk, which might be confused for a branch but for its roots, providing a sense of scale. The white foam near the trunk has some build-up of paint on a canvas that is otherwise smooth. The foam might suggest that the tree is caught on an unseen rock; there is ambiguity in whether this location is a small respite of stability or highlights the imminent danger of reaching the fall's edge.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Church's extensive study of the falls allowed him to capture the effect of mist and turbulent water with unprecedented realism. The light creates a partial rainbow beyond the precipice, whose arc is strong where the mist is thick, and absent elsewhere, a highly realistic rendering and a technical achievement.&lt;ref name="rain"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZcCtT1ZeaEC&amp;pg=PA93 |title=The Rainbow Bridge: Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science |last=Lee |first=Raymond L. |last2=Fraser |first2=Alistair B. |date=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0271019778 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distant on the horizon are a number of buildings, including [[Terrapin Point|Terrapin Tower]], on the platform of which stands a tiny person.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting accumulated damage over time, requiring Church to repaint some of it in 1886. He re-worked the sky so that it was more unified with the water, "more subservient to the cataract", but felt limited in the changes he could make by the many copies of the popular ''Niagara'' that existed at that point, in engraving and chromolithography.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and legacy==
Church developed ''Niagara'' with public exhibitions in mind. Between May 1 and 29, 1857, tens of thousands paid 25 cents to view the painting—which was greatly praised by local critics—in a darkened [[Manhattan]] gallery in which only the painting was illuminated.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;Avery, 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Some would spend an hour in front of the painting: "Spectators forgot that they were looking simply at pigment ... The painting became the surrogate of a visit in person to the site."&lt;ref name="hunt"/&gt; Many artists, writers, and politicians reportedly visited the painting's exhibition, including [[Horace Greeley]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], [[George Bancroft]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]],  [[Charles Anderson Dana]], and [[Fitz James O'Brien]].&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1983 |title=Frederic Church's ''Niagara'': Nature and the Nation's Type |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40754705 |journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=100–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand subscriptions to a planned [[chromolithograph]] were sold; $30 for an [[artist's proof]] and $15 for a print, both in color.&lt;ref name="raab38"&gt;Raab, 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harper's'' magazine called ''Niagara'' "more widely known and admired in this country than any other picture ever painted in America".&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  

The painting was shown in England and Scotland in the summer of 1857. After a showing in London, a chromolithograph was made by Day &amp; Son in June, followed by more exhibitions in Glasgow, Manchester, and Liverpool. London's ''[[The Art Journal|Art-Journal]]'' wrote, "No work of its class has ever been more successful: it is truth, obviously and certainly. Considered as a painting, it is a production of rare merit: while admirable as a whole, its parts have been carefully considered and studied; broadly and effectively wrought, yet elaborately finished."&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, 243–246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h73"&gt;Howat, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Famed art critic [[John Ruskin]] was impressed, as reported by Church's friend [[Bayard Taylor]]: "The exhibitor told me that Ruskin had just been to see it, and that he had found effects in it which he had been waiting for years to find." Ruskin was said to have marvelled at the rainbow, believing at first that the play of light through a window was projected onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="rain"/&gt; In September 1858 ''Niagara'' returned to the United States, where, after another New York showing, it travelled to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, and New Orleans.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; ''Cosmopolitan Art Journal'' wrote, "The reputation of this work has greatly increased by its English tour. It is now regarded as the finest painting ever executed by any American artist."&lt;ref name="h73"/&gt; Another exhibition in New York followed. ''Niagara'' was exhibited at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, where it won a silver medal&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; and improved the European view of American art. ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote, "The European critics declared that the 'Niagara' gave them an entirely new and higher view both of American nature and art.&lt;ref name="rodriguez"&gt;Rodriguez Roque, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Study for "Under Niagara" Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumb|This study for ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is similar  in composition to the lithograph of the lost painting.]]

Church's composition was the first painting from the [[Hudson River School]] to be an "instant success".&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt; It was uniquely realistic and "without 'manner'", marking the beginning of a new era for Hudson River artists,&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt;  such as [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], and [[Régis François Gignoux]].&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Heade especially took to ''Niagara'', which may have influenced some of his choices in canvas size. He wrote, "Church's picture ... far exceeds my expectations; &amp; I don't wonder that Ruskin, after looking at it for half an hour, could only utter 'marvelous'. I look upon it as the most wonderful picture I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade: A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonné |last=Stebbins |first=Theodore E. |last2=Comey |first2=Janet L. |last3=Heade |first3=Martin Johnson |last4=Quinn |first4=Karen E. |date=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300081839 |pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Niagara'' was sold to the New York art dealers and print sellers Williams, Stevens &amp; Williams—where it was first exhibited—for US$4,500 in 1857, including $2,000 for reproduction rights.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;  It was acquired at auction in 1861 by the businessman [[John Taylor Johnston]] for US$5,000, and then bought at auction in 1876 by [[William Wilson Corcoran]] for his [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Gallery]] for $12,500, then a record for a painting by an American artist.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt; When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was transferred to the [[National Gallery of Art]], also in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Church made two more finished paintings of the Falls. ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is now lost, but survives in lithographs, including an overpainted lithograph at Olana. It was a 4-by-6 foot painting said to be completed in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The third painting, ''[[Niagara Falls, from the American Side]]'', was made in 1867 and is the largest of Church's paintings by surface area.

A number of musical CDs have been created for the media franchise built around [[Eiichirō Oda]]'s [[manga]] ''[[One Piece]]''. Various [[theme music|theme songs]] and [[character song]]s were released on a total of 49 [[Single (music)|singles]]. Many of them were also released in collected form on the eight [[compilation album]]s or the 16 [[soundtrack]] CDs, along with background music from the anime television series, the series' feature films, and video games.

The anime television series currently consists of 36 pieces of theme music; eighteen opening themes and eighteen ending themes. As of episode 279, ending themes were omitted and, starting from episode 326 onwards, opening themes were extended from 110 seconds long to 150 seconds long. In episodes 1-206 of [[Funimation]]'s English-language release of the series, the opening and ending themes were dubbed into English by various voice actors, before reverting to the Japanese versions from episodes 207 onwards.

The sub-lists on compilation albums and singles list the releases peak position in [[Oricon]]'s weekly charts as well as the length of the release's chart run in weeks.

In 1752, [[Henry Fielding]] started a "paper war", a long term dispute with constant publication of pamphlets attacking other writers, between the various authors on London's [[Grub Street]]. Although it began as a dispute between Fielding and [[John Hill (author)|John Hill]], other authors, such as [[Christopher Smart]], [[Bonnell Thornton]], [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]], [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]], and [[Tobias Smollett]] were soon dedicating their works to aid various sides of the conflict.

The dispute lasted until 1753 and involved many of London's periodicals. It eventually resulted in countless essays, poems, and even a series of mock epic poems starting with Smart's ''[[The Hilliad]]''. Although it is unknown what actually started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or supported Hill, and few in between.

==Background==
Fielding started a "paper war" in the first issue of ''[[The Covent-Garden Journal]]'' (4 January 1752) by declaring war against "hack writers".&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"&gt;''Poetical Works'' p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; In response, John Hill claimed in the ''London Daily Advertiser'' (9 January 1752) Fielding had met with him prior to January and proposed what would be a fake paper war that would involve London writers "giving Blows that would not hurt, and sharing the Advantage in Silence."&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 135"&gt;Bertelsen p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meeting between Fielding and Hill to discuss the proposed war is believed to have occurred (if it occurred) on 28 December 1751.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Hill met Fielding for legal business between 26 and 28 December 1751 after Hill was robbed.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 556"&gt;Battesin p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hill had revealed this information, he attacked Fielding's ''[[Amelia (novel)|Amelia]]'' in the ''London Daily Advertiser'' on 8 January 1752. The book's title character, Amelia, was involved in an accident that damaged her face, and Hill, mocking the way Fielding described the scene, claimed that she "could charm the World without the Help of a Nose."&lt;ref name="Sabor p. 96"&gt;Sabor p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In response to both the revelation and personal attacks, Fielding wrote on 11 January 1752: "If the Betrayer of a private Treaty could ever deserve the least Credit, yet his ''Lowness'' here must proclaim himself either a Liar, or a Fool. None can doubt that he is the former, if he hath feigned this Treaty, and I think few would scruple to call him the latter, if he had rejected it."&lt;ref&gt;''Covent-Garden Journal'' No. 3, 11 January 1752&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battesin p. 555–556&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of the merits of Hill's claim, a war was soon started: by the third issue of ''The Covent-Garden Journal'', Fielding narrowed his satire upon John Hill.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt;

Although Hill, Fielding, Smart, Thornton, Kenrick, Murphy, and Smollett were all involved in the dispute, not all of them used their actual names; instead, many preferred to use pseudonyms along with attacks under their own name:&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 135"/&gt; Fielding wrote as "Sir Alexander Drawcansir"; Hill wrote as "The Inspector"; Thornton wrote as "Madam Roxanna"; and Smart wrote as "Mrs. Mary Midnight".&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 135"/&gt; It was under these pseudonyms that various authors soon responded to Fielding's attacks and to Fielding's plan for a "Universal Register Office", a planned center of advertisement of jobs, goods for sale, and other items.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 137"&gt;Bertelsen p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; If this was not enough, Fielding started a dispute, just a few months before, with Philip D'Halluin, a former employee who established the competing "Public Register Office" in King Street, [[Covent Garden]], who hired Bonnell Thorton, a friend of Smart, to attack Fielding and Hill.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 138"/&gt; However, Hill had previously aided Fielding in this matter.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 138"&gt;Bertelsen p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Hill attacked both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in the only issue of ''The Impertinent'' to be produced.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt; Although the work was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 ''The Inspector'' column in the ''London Daily Advertiser''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt; With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's ''Poems on Several Occasions''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt; Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of ''The Covent-Garden Journal'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Goldgar p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
Although it is quite possible that the first work in the "war" was produced by Smart on 29 April 1751,&lt;ref&gt;Mahony and Rizzo Item 128&lt;/ref&gt; it is also possible that the origins of the dispute could be traced even further back to Hill's publications between February and March 1751.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt; Fielding's first paper in the "war" was also the first issue of ''The Covent-Garden Journal'' on 4 January 1752.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 138"&gt;Bertelsen p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Fielding attacked all of the writers of Grub Street, which brought a quick response.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 138"/&gt; Hill responded twice and claimed that Fielding was planning a fake dispute on 9 January 1752, Smollet attacked Hill's piece on 15 January 1752, and Thornton soon responded against Fielding in ''Have At You All: or, The Drury Lane Journal'' on 16 January 1752.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 138"/&gt;

During this time, personal works, such as Fielding's ''Amelia'', became targets.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 534"&gt;Battesin p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1752, Fielding responded to Hill and those who supported his view of ''Amelia'' in ''The Covent-Garden Journal'' by stating:

{{quote|a famous Surgeon, who absolutely cured one Mrs Amelia Booth, of a violent Hurt in her Nose, insomuch, that she had scarce a Scar left on it, intends to bring Actions against several ill-meaning and slanderous People, who have reported that the said Lady had no Nose, merely because the Author of her History, in a Hurry, forgot to inform his Readers of that Particular.&lt;ref name="Sabor p. 97"&gt;Sabor p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hill was not the only one to attack the work; Thornton wrote satires of ''Amelia'' in the ''Drury-Lane Journal''.&lt;ref name="Sabor p. 96"/&gt; Thornton's satires were first published on 16 January 1752 and included a fake advertisement for a parody novel called "Shamelia", playing off of title of Fielding's parody ''[[An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews|Shamela]]''.&lt;ref name="Sabor p. 96"/&gt; He later parodied ''Amelia'' again on 13 February 1752 in a piece called "A New Chapter in ''Amelia''."&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 534"/&gt; Tobias Smollett joined in and published the pamphlet ''Habbakkuk Hilding'' anonymously on 15 January 1752.&lt;ref name="Sabor p. 97"/&gt; Although there were many attacks against Fielding's novel, there was some support for the work, and an anonymous pamphlet was written to attack "Hill and 'the Town'" while praising ''Amelia''.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 537"&gt;Battesin p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 1752, Fielding defended his work again by bringing the novel before the imaginary "Court of Censorial Enquiry", in which Hill and the other critics are the prosecutors and it is they, not ''Amelia'', that are truly put on trial.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 537"/&gt;

''The Covent-Garden Journal'' served Fielding well and he used it in his attacks upon Hill and Hill's supporters in the ''Journal'' piece called "Journal of the present Paper War between the Forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the Army of Grub-street".&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 555"&gt;Battesin p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; The work was modelled after [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' and Fielding pretended to be a military leader that would lead "English VETERANS" against those who were compared to characters from the Greek and Roman classics along with those from modern French literature.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 555"/&gt; However, he changed roles on the fourth issue, produced on 14 January 1752, and transformed himself into a "judge".&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 555"/&gt; By February, Kenrick joined in and "dramatized" the "Paper War" in a production called ''Fun'' and proceeded to defend Fielding.&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 557"&gt;Battesin p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Macklin followed suit by holding a benefit on 8 April 1752 at the Covent Garden with a two-act play called ''The Covent Garden Theater, or Pasquin Turn'd Drawcansir''; the play portrayed Fielding attacking the Hill and his followers, the "Town".&lt;ref name="Battesin p. 557"/&gt;

A pamphlet in the ''London Daily Advertiser'' published on 29 January 1752 called ''The March of the Lion'' links various authors involved in the war and is the first to introduce Smart via a reference to his "Mrs. Mary Midnight" pseudonym, although Smart was not yet a participant.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smart did begin directly participating in the matter 4 August 1752 with the publication in ''The Midwife'' of a parody on Hill's "Inspector" persona.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 143"&gt;Bertelsen p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Smart responded to Hill's attack on Smart's "Old Woman's Oratory" show and Hill's claim that the show was dead.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 143"/&gt; Hill was quick to respond; he attacked both Fielding and Smart in a piece published on 13 August 1752 in the only issue of ''The Impertinent''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 143"/&gt; In the work, Hill claimed that authors either write because "they have wit" or "they are hungry".&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 143"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Impertinent"&gt;''The Impertinent'' No 1. 13 August 1752&lt;/ref&gt; He further claimed that Smart,
{{quote|wears a ridiculous comicalness of aspect, that makes people smile when they see him at a distance: His mouth opens, because he must be fed; and the world often joins with the philosopher in laughing at the insensibility and obstinancy that make him prick his lips with thistles."&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 143"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Impertinent"/&gt;
The work was published anonymously. Some tried to claim that Samuel Johnson was the author and Hill tried to hide his authorship by attacking the essay in the 25 August 1752 "The Inspector" (No. 464).&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was soon exposed and it became commonly known that Hill produced both and he soon followed up the pamphlet in the ''London Daily Advertiser''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt;}}

With his 25 August 1752 ''The Inspector'' column, Hill harshly criticised Smart's ''Poems on Several Occasions''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt; Although Hill claimed to praise Smart, he did so in a manner, as Betty Rizzo claims, "that managed to insult and degrade Smart with patronizing encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Murphy responded to this essay, and to Hill, in the 21 October 1752 edition of the ''Gray's Inn Journal''.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 144"&gt;Bertelsen p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Following Murphy, Thornton attacked both Hill and Fielding in ''The Spring-Garden Journal'' on 16 November 1752.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 144"/&gt; The ''Gentleman's Journal'' issue of November 1752 came out with a quick retort and claimed that those who supported Hill "espoused the cause of Gentleman" and those who sided with Fielding espoused the cause "of the comedian."&lt;ref name="Rizzo p. 344"&gt;Rizzo pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt; This essay accomplished little but to polarise both sides even more.&lt;ref name="Rizzo p. 344"/&gt; Hill then responded to Murphy, and their dispute was printed in a supplement of the December issue of the ''Gentleman's Journal''.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt;

On 1 February 1753, Smart published ''The Hilliad'', an attack upon Hill that one critic, Lance Bertelsen, describes as the "loudest broadside" of the war.&lt;ref name="Bertelsen p. 144"/&gt; The response to ''The Hilliad'' was swift: Samuel Derrick responded directly with his ''The Smartiad'', Arthur Murphy criticized Smart for his personally attacking Hill, and ''Rules for Being a Wit'' tried to provoke further response from Smart.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 142"&gt;Mounsey p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smart stopped responding to either of these assaults.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 142"/&gt; Soon after, Hill ended his attacks with the final shot in December 1752.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works p. 443"/&gt;

== Arts ==
In the [[performing arts]], a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more [[Work of art|works of art]] to an [[audience]]. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically described as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Music as Play.'' In: Paulo de Assis (ed.), ''Virtual Works – Actual Things: Essays in Musical Ontology.'' Leuven University Press, Leuven 2018 (Orpheus Institute Series), pp. 115–133. [https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/publicaties/virtual-works-actual-things/ pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the performers participate in [[rehearsal]]s beforehand. 

An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994 defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.&lt;ref name="ShippmannAsh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shippmann|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=Ash|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Batjtsta|first3=Mariangela|last4=Carr|first4=Linda|last5=Eyde|first5=Lorraine D.|last6=Hesketh|first6=Beryl|last7=Kehoe|first7=Jerry|last8=Pearlman|first8=Kenneth|last9=Prien|first9=Erich P.|last10=Sanchez|first10=Juan I.|title=THE PRACTICE OF COMPETENCY MODELING|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=53|issue=3|year=2000|pages=703–740|issn=0031-5826|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance may also describe the way in which an [[actor]] performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a [[mime artist]], [[comedian]], [[Evocation|conjurer]], or other entertainer.

Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal performance state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff , G. Gregory|author2=Triplett , N. Travis|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfuXCgAAQBAJ|edition=4th|year=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-1-4925-0162-6|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of [[fear]]
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or [[self-efficacy]]
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve [[automaticity]]. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Landy|author2=Jeffrey M. Conte|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K1rnp9uAscC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9025-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill, even over practice itself can result in failure due to [[ego depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. L., Hardy, T., &amp; Arkin, R. (2009). When practice doesn't make perfect: Effort expenditure as an active behavioral self-handicapping strategy.

Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|issue=1|pages=123–130|pmid=7367532|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2|pmid=24477850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported [[anxiety]] of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclntyre|first1=Valerie|title=Heart Rate Variability as a Predictor of Speaking Anxiety|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2010|volume=27|issue=4|pages=286–297|doi=10.1080/08824096.2010.496323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other physiological responses to public performance include [[perspiration]], secretion of the [[adrenal glands]], and increased blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brutten|first1=Eugene|title=A Palmer Sweat Investigation of the Effect of Audience Variation Upon Stage Fright.|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92–96|doi=10.1080/03637756309375363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Petäjävesi Old Church''' ({{lang-fi|Petäjäveden vanha kirkko}}) is a wooden church located in [[Petäjävesi]], [[Finland]]. It was built between 1763 and 1765, when [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] was still a part of [[Sweden]]. The bell tower was built in 1821. It was inscribed in 1994 on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. 

The church is located about {{convert|1|km}} to the west of the centre of Petäjävesi. The church went out of use in 1879 when the new church was built. The old church has retained its original appearance and its interior decoration exceptionally well. It is a popular church for weddings in the summer, and there is a church service on most Sundays.

==Construction==
The church was built as the chapel for the area of Petäjävesi, which has belonged to the congregation of Jämsä. The local people had been given the permission to build a graveyard and a small village church at their own expense by the crown as early as in 1728 because the trip to Jämsä was long, however it took about 35 years until the construction began. The church was planned and built by Jaakko Klemetinpoika Leppänen, a church builder from [[Vesanka]]. In 1821 the windows were enlarged and the sacristy was moved from the northern part of the church to the east. The bell tower was also added by Erkki Leppänen, the grandson of the original builder.

==Architecture==
The cross-type floor plan of the church came into use in the Nordic countries at the end of the 17th century and became common in the 18th century in the countryside churches {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. The high roof resembles the earlier [[gothic architecture|gothic style]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==From forgotten to world heritage==
After the new church was built, the old remained abandoned for a long time. Only the cemetery around the church and the belltower were in use. In the 1920s an Austrian art historian [[Josef Strzygowski]] noticed the architectural and historical value of the church and since 1929 it has been restored several times. In 1994 it was approved in the UNESCO's World Heritage Sites representing typical eastern Scandinavian wooden church tradition.

The '''''Portugaliae Monumenta Historica''''' (Historical Monuments of Portugal, abbreviated PMH) is a collection of &lt;!--[[Critical edition|critically edited]]--&gt; texts from [[Portuguese history]]. Inspired by the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', it was published by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa]] between 1856 and 1917 and divided into four sections: ''Scriptores'' (writers), ''Leges et Consuetudines'' (laws and customs), ''Diplomata et Chartae'' (diplomas and charters) and ''Inquisitiones'' (investigations). The first three were compiled under the direction of [[Alexandre Herculano]] before 1873, and the last, ''Inquisitiones'', between 1888 and 1897, after his death. The documents date from the [[Middle Ages]] and are primarily in [[Middle Latin]] and [[Old Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;João Dionísio, "After the Lisbon Earthquake: Reassembling History", ''European Studies: A Journal of European Culture, History and Politics'' '''26'''.1 (2008): 151–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock the Vote''' is a [[non-profit organization]], progressive-aligned group in the [[United States]] whose stated mission is "to engage and build the political power of young people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/about-us/|publisher=Rock The Vote|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded in 1990 by Virgin Records America Co-Chairman Jeff Ayeroff,  to encourage young people to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contrera|first1=Jessica|title=Lil Jon and Lena Dunham team up to take on what Madonna and Chuck D pioneered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/10/07/lil-jon-and-lena-dunham-team-up-to-take-on-what-madonna-and-chuck-d-pioneered/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is geared toward increasing voter turnout among voters ages 18 to 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lurie|first1=Stephen|title=Millennial turnout is crucial.

==History==
Rock the Vote was founded in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff with Virgin America co Chair Jordan Harris and Virgin Executive Beverly Lund.  Later they hired Jodi Uttal and then  [[Steve Barr (educational innovator)|Steve Barr]], a campaign worker and political fundraiser, who became "co-founders" for their contribution to Rock the Vote.
Rock the Vote supported the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]], commonly referred to as the "motor voter" bill, which expanded access to voter registration. It was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]]. The law requires state governments to offer voter registration opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver's license or public assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cloward|first1=Richard|last2=Pivin|first2=Frances Scott|title=Why Americans Still Don't Vote: And why Politicians Want it that Way|date=2000|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807004494|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Rock the Vote created the first telephone voter registration system, 1-800-REGISTER, followed by the first online voter-registration system, NetVote, later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flanagin|first1=Jake|title=Here’s Why You Should Turn Out and Rock the Vote|url=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/heres-why-you-should-turn-out-and-rock-the-vote/?_r=0|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We supported Rock the Vote," said [[Radiohead]]'s [[Thom Yorke]], "but – because of the way the whole political system works – it does seem rather odd to be choosing between one unworkable, outdated system and another. We need to go beyond that – because, at the moment, it's just [[Cowboys and Indians (disambiguation)|Cowboys and Indians]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Caitlin |last= [[Caitlin Moran|Moran]] |title= Everything was just fear. |magazine= ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' |date= July 1997 |page= 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[CNN]], Rock the Vote organized "America Rocks the Vote," a 2003 Democratic presidential candidates forum at [[Faneuil Hall]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN, Rock the Vote to co-sponsor Democratic candidate forum|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/01/elec04.prez.rock.vote/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=CNN|date=October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock the Vote has expressed support for a [[public health insurance option]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattera|first1=Jason|title=Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439172094|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; It signed on to [[Health Care for America NOW!]], a progressive political coalition that supported passage of the [[Affordable Care Act]]. In 2009, Rock the Vote ran a campaign encouraging people to refuse to have sex with those who opposed what they regarded as a reform of American health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock the Vote Asks Supporters to Withhold Sex to Pass Health Care Reform|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/21/rock-vote-asks-supporters-withhold-sex-pass-health-care-reform/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Fox News|date=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Rock the Vote drew criticism from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] officials such as [[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Ed Gillespie]] for sending a mock [[military draft|draft]] notice to over 600,000 e-mail addresses. The message included the words "[[Selective Service System]]" and read "You are hereby ordered for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States, and to report to a polling place near you" on November 2, ([[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]). The Rock the Vote logo and a facsimile of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s signature appeared at the bottom of the message. In addition, Rock the Vote created [[public service announcement]]s featuring the subject of the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock The Vote, MTV Irk GOP|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65818/rock-the-vote-mtv-irk-gop|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisto|first1=Christine|title=Rock the Democratic Vote|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/389978/rock-democratic-vote-christine-sisto|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=National Review|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides making the PSAs available to large cable systems, they also paid to run them on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.&lt;ref name="vavreck"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Green |first=Donald P. |last2=Vavreck |first2=Lynn |date=2008 |title=Analysis of Cluster-Randomized Experiments: A Comparison of Alternative Estimation Approaches |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Green4/publication/31382310_Analysis_of_Cluster-Randomized_Experiments_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Estimation_Approaches/links/00b4951f9a12acc282000000.pdf |journal=Political Analysis |language=en |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=138–152 |doi=10.1093/pan/mpm025 |issn=1047-1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Rock the Vote experienced financial problems in the aftermath of the 2004 election. It emerged from the election $700,000 in debt, and its president resigned in the summer of 2005 "amid disagreements about the organization's direction."&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;

In 2008, Rock the Vote ran the largest non-partisan youth voter registration drive in the nation's history by getting 2.6 million young voters registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuirt|first1=Mary|title=Young Black Turnout a Record in 2008 Election|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8140030|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends "liked" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922072845 |title=Get out the vote : how to increase voter turnout |last=Green |first=Donald P. |isbn=081572568X |edition= Third |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=97–98, 101, 120–121 |oclc=922072845}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

In advance of the 2014 elections, Rock the Vote released a video titled "Turn Out For What." It was a parody of [[Lil Jon]] and [[DJ Snake]]'s song "[[Turn Down for What]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Lena Dunham, Lil Jon Team for Rock the Vote's 'Turn Out for What' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/lena-dunham-lil-jon-team-for-rock-the-votes-turn-out-for-what-video-20141007|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video sought to encourage youth voter turnout and featured [[reproductive rights]], [[marijuana legalization]], [[global warming]], [[LGBT rights]], student debt, [[gun control]] and [[deforestation]] as reasons why young people might want to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peligri|first1=Justin|title=Lil Jon and Lena Dunham 'Turn Out' in new Rock The Vote video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/politics/new-rock-the-vote-video/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=CNN|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was criticized by some Republicans who said it had a disproportionate representation of liberal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rock the Vote' celebrities called out for not voting in last mid-term election|url=http://abc7.com/politics/rock-the-vote-celebrities-called-out-for-not-voting/380155/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was also criticized because several of the celebrities who appeared in it, including [[Lena Dunham]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Natasha Lyonne]] and [[Darren Criss]], had not voted in the previous midterm election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lombardi|first1=Ken|title=Some Rock The Vote midterm PSA stars didn't vote in last midterm|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rock-the-vote-midterm-psa-celebrities-didnt-vote-in-last-midterm/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=CBS News|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Russian Symphony Orchestra Society''' (also known simply as the '''Russian Symphony Orchestra''') was founded in {{start date|1903}} in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: Plans Outlined for the Coming Worcester Festival&amp;mdash;Russian Symphony Society Incorporated&amp;mdash;Notes Concerning Coming Events of Importance", ''New York Times'', 9 September 1903, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slatkin&gt;Leonard Slatkin, ''Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro'' (2012), Amadeus Press, p. 32. {{ISBN|1574672045}}. Accessed [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7os-1XoxAYC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Modest Altschuler]], and functioned for fifteen years.&lt;ref name=Slatkin/&gt;

[[Oscar Levant]] described the orchestra as having constituted "a school for [[concertmaster]]s"; among its members were [[Frederic Fradkin]] (concertmaster of the [[Boston Symphony]]), [[Maximilian Pilzer]] (concertmaster of the [[New York Philharmonic]]), [[Ilya Skolnik]] (concertmaster of the [[Detroit Symphony]]), and [[Louis Edlin]] (concertmaster of the [[National Orchestral Association]]).&lt;ref name=Levant&gt;Oscar Levant, ''A Smattering of Ignorance'' (1940), Doubleday, pp. 27&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Film music conductors [[Nikolai Sokoloff]], [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]&lt;ref name=shilkret1&gt;Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Shell, Niel and Barbara Shilkret, ''Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business'', Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005, p. 14. {{ISBN|0-8108-5128-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nat Finston]] were also Russian Symphony Orchestra alumni, as was trumpeter [[Harry Glantz]].&lt;ref name=Levant /&gt; The orchestra also formed the backbone of the '''New Music Society of America''', founded in December 1905.

They performed the New York premieres of numerous pieces by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], including Stravinsky's first symphony (the [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E-flat]]) and ''[[The Firebird]]''.&lt;ref name=Levant /&gt;

==History==

===The early years===
The orchestra's debut public performance was at [[Cooper Union]] Hall on January 7, 1904, and, according to [[Leonard Slatkin]], featured works by [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], and the American premiere of Rachmaninoff's ''[[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]]''.&lt;ref name=Slatkin /&gt; However, the ''New York Times'' of January 3, 1904 lists the program as consisting of the Overture from Glinka's ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'', a baritone aria from [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]'', an ''intermezzo'' from [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], a Russian dance by [[Eduard Nápravník]] and the symphonic suite ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]];&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Concerts&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 3 January 1904, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' of January 24 that same year mentions their second concert as including Wieniawski's ''Souvenir de Moscou''&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 24 January 1904, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewing a later concert in the series mentions a performance of "'The Cliff' by Rachmaninoff," presumably the same piece as ''The Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Stageland Jottings: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 29 January 1904, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1904&amp;ndash;1905 season, the orchestra, now expanded to 85 musicians,&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra, ''New York Times'', 20 November 1904, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; performed six concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]], featuring a works by a broad range of Russian composers,&lt;ref name="1905-11-05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Echoes from the World of Music: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 16 October 1904, p. SMA6.&lt;/ref&gt; including a violin concerto by [[Julius Conus]].&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 30 October 1904, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' summarized the season as "resplendent with novelties,"&lt;ref name="1905-04-02"&gt;"The Russian Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 2 April 1905, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and praised their "enthusiasm"&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 25 December 1904, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "absorbing interest" of their selected material,&lt;ref name="1905-04-02" /&gt; but was critical of the technical quality of their performances, particularly in comparison with their initial series of concerts at Cooper Union.&lt;ref name="1905-04-02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 22 January 1905, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; That season, they were the first to use a [[celesta]] in concert performance in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 4 January 1905, p. X4.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many Russian pieces given their American premieres that season was Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 15 January 1905, p. SMA4.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth concert of the season consisted entirely of works that had never before been presented in New York: [[Vasily Kalinnikov]]'s first symphony, [[Anton Arensky]]'s suite "Silhouettes", and excerpts from [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[Khovanshchina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 19 February 1905, p. X3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, their six Saturday night concerts at Carnegie Hall were supplemented by three "popular price" concerts there on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name="1905-10-05"&gt;"A Season of Great Musical Activity&amp;hellip; Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 5 October 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra formed a relationship with [[Vasily Safonov]].&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Concerts", ''New York Times'', 29 July 1905, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Rachmininoff was engaged as a guest conductor and piano soloist for concerts of his music performed on April 7&amp;ndash;8, 1906, and Safonov's former pupil, pianist [[Joseph Lhévinne]], was brought over to make his American debut;&lt;ref name="1905-10-05" /&gt; both were in their early thirties at the time, as was composer [[Vasily Zolotarev]], whose ''Rhapsodie Hébraïque'' was also performed that season at Safonov's suggestion. ''Rhapsodie hébraïque'', presented on the last two days of 1905, was based on [[Secular Jewish music|secular Jewish melodies]] that the ''Times'' characterized as "the musical equivalent of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes: Concerts, Recitals and Church Choir News", ''New York Times'' , 17 December 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt; Pianist [[Raoul Pugno]] also participated in the season as a soloist, playing Rachmaninoff's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|second piano concerto]].&lt;ref name="1905-10-05"&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 12 November 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes: New York's Musical Public Increasing Rapidly", ''New York Times'', 29 October 1905, p. X1&amp;ndash;X2.&lt;/ref&gt; Now expanded to 90 musicians, the orchestra was becoming an increasingly professional affair with, as the ''Times'' put it, "soloists of the first rank."&lt;ref name="1905-11-05"&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra, ''New York Times'', 5 November 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of those soloists was [[Giuseppe Campanari]], a [[baritone]] associated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. The chaos of the  [[Revolution of 1905]] prevented sending scores from Russia for the orchestra to accompany Campanari on arias from Tchaikovsky's ''[[Iolanta]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' (''Pique Dame''), and the performances were almost canceled. The only known copy of even the texts of the arias that could readily be found in New York was a German translation. The situation was finally rescued by "a little music store on [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]]" which had held the relevant scores in stock, unsold for about a decade after they had been purchased from a Russian tenor in need of cash.&lt;ref&gt;"East Side Junk Yields Music For Campanari", ''New York Times'', 25 December 1905, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pianist [[Josef Lhévinne]] likewise had an extremely difficult time escaping the turmoil of revolution in Moscow to come to New York to play with the Russian Symphony and others, facing danger from both the revolutionists and the government.&lt;ref&gt;"Lhevinne Risked Life In Flight From Moscow: Young Pianist Arrives with a Tale of Terrors in the City&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 16 January 1906, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his troubles were compounded by an injury to a finger,&lt;ref&gt;"Lhevinne Hurt His Finger: Accident at the Piano Almost Prevented Him From Playing", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1906, p. X2.&lt;/ref&gt; his January 27, 1906 performance featured [[Anton Rubinstein]]'s Fifth Concerto, and drew a very favorably review from the ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Latest Russian Pianist: Josef Lhevinne Makes an Excellent Impression at His First Concert", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1906, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Music Society of America - 1906 ad.jpg|thumb|left]]
In late December 1905, Altschuler and others announced the formation of the New Music Society of America, soliciting "serious new work" from American composers, with the Russian Symphony functioning as the group's orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;"New Organization Will Have Aid of the Russian Symphony Society, ''New York Times'', 27 December 1905, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A first Carnegie Hall concert originally scheduled for February 19 apparently never occurred, because the ''New York Times'' refers to a March 10 concert as the group's first; another concert took place April 2, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Music Makers", ''New York Times'', 7 January 1906, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-11"&gt;"Music by Americans: The First Concert of the New Music Society in Carnegie Hall", ''New York Times'', 11 March 1906, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent pieces at that first concert [[Edward MacDowell]]'s ''[[Indian Suite]]'' and ''Second Concerto'' (hardly "new": although only in his forties, MacDowell was already in his final illness at the time); the orchestra also performed [[Henry F. Gilbert]]'s ''Salammbô's Invocation to Tänith'' and [[Arthur Shepard]]'s ''Overture Joyeuse''.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-11"/&gt; The second concert featured violinist [[Maud Powell]] as a soloist; works included [[George Whitefield Chadwick]]'s ''Melpomene'' overture, the premiere of a violin concerto by [[Henry Holden Huss]], and premieres of pieces by [[David Stanley Smith (composer)|David Stanley Smith]] and [[Frederick Converse]].&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 25 March 1906, p. X4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"American Music Heard", ''New York Times'', 3 April 1906, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

That season, the March 17, 1906 concert featured the first American performance of the young [[Reinhold Glière]]'s ''Symphony No 1 in E-flat major, Op. 8'' (composed 1900) as well as American premieres of pieces by [[César Cui]] a Cossack dance by [[Alexander Serov]], who had died 35 years earlier in an era when Russian music had little currency in America, and 'a new concerto for violin, by Mlinarski," presumably the ''Concerto in D minor'' (composed c. 1897) by the [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Emil Młynarski]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 11 March 1906, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-18"&gt;"New Russian Works", ''New York Times'', 18 March 1906, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unrest in Russia at that time prevented Rachmaninoff from visiting America, scuttling his planned April 7 performance.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-18" /&gt; Instead, violinist and composer [[Émile Sauret]] was featured, performing [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s ''[[Violin Concerto (Dvořák)|Violin Concerto in A Minor]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-04-01"&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 1 April 1906. p. X3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Emile Sauret Heard Again"", ''New York Times'', 8 April 1906. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The same concert included two pieces by composer [[Anton Arensky]], who had died on February 25.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-04-01" /&gt;

===An established orchestra===
By the end of the 1906 season, the Russian Symphony Orchestra was an established part of the New York music scene. In all, the ''New York Times'' counted six New York premieres by the Russian Symphony Orchestra as such in 1906, and three more by the New Music Society.&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Music Makers", ''New York Times'', 22 April 1906. p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, the Society announced that Altschuler would be retained as Director for three more years, with Russian Ambassador Baron [[Roman Rosen]] continuing as honorary president.&lt;ref&gt;"Modest Altschuler Re-elected", ''New York Times'', 26 May 1906. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking forward to the 1906-1907 musical season, the ''Times'' counted them among the city's major orchestras, along with the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[New York Symphony Orchestra]], [[Peoples' Symphony Concerts]], and [[Sam Franko]]'s [[American Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Aldrich, "In the World of Music: Prospects of the Season", ''New York Times'', 28 October 1906. p. X6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1906-7 season saw an appearance by pianist and composer [[Alexander Scriabin]] under the baton of his (and Altschuler's) conservatory teacher [[Vasily Safonov]]. An anonymous ''New York Times'' review praised Scriabin's playing, while finding him immature as a composer. The same reviewer panned [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ''Third Symphony'', which had its American premiere on this occasion: "[W]hat Russian music the conductor's of the more cosmopolitan orchestras have left for the Russians to put down on their programmes as given 'for the first time' may have been rejected rather than overlooked."&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony: A Programme of New Works -- Alexander Scriabine Plays His Own Concerto", ''New York Times'', 21 December 1906, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently undaunted by that criticism, the orchestra announced two days later that its concert of January 17 would feature American premieres of Rachmaninoff's ''[[Spring (Rachmaninoff)|Spring]]'' cantata and [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Karelia Suite|Karelia]]'' overture,&lt;ref&gt;"Musical notes", ''New York Times'', 23 December 1906, p.X5.&lt;/ref&gt; though apparently Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' was substituted for the Rachmininoff.&lt;ref name="times-1907-01-18"&gt;"New Russian Music", ''New York Times'', 18 January 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' doubled down in its criticism: "[M]any of the things by the Russian composers that we do not know seem upon presentation hardly worth knowing. … ''Antar'' … is no symphony by any recognized definition of the term… This would be nothing against the music if it could win acceptance for itself as music, which it did not last evening."&lt;ref name="times-1907-01-18"/&gt; While continuing its skepticism toward recent Russian music, the ''Times'' had high praise for soloist [[Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler]]'s February 7, 1907 performance of [[Anton Rubenstein]]'s already well-known  [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rubinstein)|D Minor Concerto (No. 4)]], though suggesting that the orchestra "show[ed] a lack of rehearsal with the pianist."&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Zeisler Wins Audience", ''New York Times'', 8 February 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth of six concerts that season on February 28, featuring a return by pianist Josef Lhévinne, consisted entirely of Russian pieces performed for the first time in America, although they were not recent works. The orchestral introduction of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'' and Rubinstein's ''Caprice Russe'' were both by composers who had died before the turn of the century. [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]]'s ''[[Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 2|Iveria Suite]]'' (1896) and [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 1 (Scriabin)|First Symphony]]'' (completed 1900), while also not particularly recent, were at least by then-living composers, and Scriabin was present for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;"A Russian Concert: Music for Orchestra and Piano Heard for the First Time", ''New York Times'', 1 March 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Altschuler traveled to Europe to engage soloists for the 1907-1908 season,&lt;ref&gt;"Engages Russian Soloists: Modest Altschuler Tells His Plans For Next Season's Concerts", ''New York Times'', 19 July 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; which began with a special concert November 10 at their largest venue to date: accompanying violinist [[Jan Kubelik]] at the [[New York Hippodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vast Audience at Kubelik Recital", ''New York Times'', 11 November 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar performance was given the following year, March 15, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;"Kubelik at the Hippodrome", 16 March 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;) Four days later they began their regular season at Carnegie Hall with Russian ambassador [[Roman Rosen|Baron Rosen]] in attendance, and with a program consisting largely of American premieres of Russian pieces: [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Glazunov)|Symphony No. 8]]'', composed roughly two years earlier; arrangements of Russian folk songs by Glazunov, [[Anatoly Lyadov]], and Rimsky-Korsakov; and Mussorgsky's "[[Pictures at an Exhibition#No. 10 "The Great Gate of Kiev"|Great Gate of Kiev]]". The program also featured the American debut of young Russian violinist [[Lea Luboshutz]] (listed at the time as ''Laya Luboshiz''),&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Orchestra: A Concert of New Compositions in Carnegie Hall", ''New York Times'', 1 November 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; who received eight curtain calls for her solo on Tchaikovsky's ''[[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Of Musical Interest", ''Brooklyn Life'', 23 November 1907, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not the only notable female soloist to play with the orchestra that season: on February 13, 1908, cellist [[May Muklé]] performed [[Karl Davydov]]'s ''Cello Concerto No. 2 in A minor''.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Concert", ''New York Times'', 14 February 1908, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broader recognition and touring===
1908 also brought unprecedented recognition from Russia itself. The tsar granted the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]] to orchestra president [[Frank Seymour Hastings]] in recognition of his promotion of Russian music in America.&lt;ref name=czar&gt;"Czar to Honor Musician", ''New York Times'', 5 June 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1908-1909, the orchestra reduced its Carnegie Hall season from six performances to four,&lt;ref name="1908 plans"&gt;"Russian Symphony's Plans", ''New York Times'', 17 September 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and began taking on other performance opportunities. At Carnegie Hall, they continued to present notable soloists: the debut of [[Mischa Elman]] (19 years old at the time&lt;ref&gt;"Mischa Elman Appears", ''New York Times'', 11 December 1908, p.8. ''The Times'' described him as "an artist already of remarkable powers of whom much that is interesting is to be expected."&lt;/ref&gt;), a return by Josef Lhévinne, and also an appearance by [[Alexander Petschnikoff]].&lt;ref name="1908 plans" /&gt; After a November 16, 1908 tryout in [[New Haven, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="New Haven"&gt;"Russian Music With Acting", ''New York Times'', 17 November 1908, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; on February 11, 1909, they collaborated with the [[Ben Greet]] Players on a Carnegie Hall performance of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' incorporating [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn]]'s incidental music,&lt;ref&gt;"Orchestra Aids Greet Players", ''New York Times'', 12 Feb 1909, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; a performance that was repeated at [[Lake George, New York|Lake George]] on August 30&lt;ref&gt;"Lake George: Sylvan Players Begin Dramatic Festival in Natural Amphitheatre", ''New York Times'', 29 August 1909, p.X3.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Carnegie Hall on New Year's Day 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Calendar of Concerts", ''New York Times'', 26 Dec 1909, p.SM13.&lt;/ref&gt; These performances constituted the first time Mendelssohn's music was performed in conjunction with the play in the United States.&lt;ref name="1908 plans" /&gt; The two groups collaborated further, including a 1910 production of Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Orchestra and Greet Players", ''New York Times'', 11 February 1910, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of performances in the 1910-1911 season which repeated these pieces and added ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', and ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref&gt;"Greet Players with Russian Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 27 November 1910, p. 9. The ''Times'' article doesn't elaborate on ''Sakuntala'': presumably one of numerous plays about [[Shakuntala]], a figure in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides a broader variety of New York performances, the orchestra toured extensively.&lt;ref name=Levant /&gt; Although they had already toured in December 1907, when the ''New York Times'' mentions them traveling to "Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Madison, Wis. and other cities," bringing along pianists [[Ernest Hutcheson]] and [[Ernest Schelling]],&lt;ref&gt;"Music Notes'', ''New York Times'', 8 December 1907, p. X2.&lt;/ref&gt; their 1908 touring plans extended as far as the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref name=czar/&gt; Their tours could involve large numbers of performances. For example, a newspaper from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] shows the orchestra performing four separate concerts (at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.) on a single Wednesday in September 1911. The programs were each entirely different, and the music ranged from [[Beethoven]] through [[Richard Wagner]], [[Verdi]] and [[Puccini]] to Sibelius and Scriabin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1126&amp;dat=19110906&amp;id=p59hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IGYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4773,4128233 Symphony Programs Cause Enthusiasm], ''The Gazette Times'' (Pittsburgh), 6 September 1911, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1910s===
[[File:MaudeAllanSalomeHead.jpg|thumb|right|Maud Allan as Salomé; in the New York performance, "the head itself was left to the imagination, but none of the caressing was."&lt;ref name="NYT-Salomé" /&gt;]]
The orchestra began the 1910s with a premiere of a different sort. After a January 1 Carnegie Hall reprise of their ''Midsummer Night'' collaboration with Ben Greet, on January 20 their second performance of the new decade introduced dancer [[Maud Allan]] to the New York audience. Although American-born, Allan had begun her dancing career in England and Europe, and this was her first American appearance. Like [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Loie Fuller]], Allan choreographed for herself, using existing classical pieces. On this occasion she danced a piece on [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] themes, using music from Anton Rubenstein, Mendelssohn, [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]. The performance alternated Allan's dances with straight orchestral performances.&lt;ref&gt;"Maud Allan in Greek Dances", ''New York Times'', 21 January 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; A concert a week later featured Rachmaninoff as a guest conductor for the American premiere of his ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and as a soloist on his ''[[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Rachmaninoff as Conductor", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Further performances with Allan followed, with the dancer performing her signature ''Visions of Salomé'', among other pieces.&lt;ref name="NYT-Salomé"&gt;"Maud Allan as Salome", ''New York Times'', 30 January 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Allan to Repeat Salome Dance", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display ad, ''New York Times'', 9 February 1910, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Musical World", ''New York Times'', 27 February 1910, p. SM15.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, the orchestra played a benefit for Russian immigrants at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]], featuring several musical soloists as well as ballet dancers [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Mikhail Mordkin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Music Notes", ''New York Times'', 1 April 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pavlowa Dances for Charity", ''New York Times'', 5 April 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910-1911 season featured five Carnegie Hall concerts interspersed with numerous out-of-town shows and followed by a 20-week national tour.&lt;ref&gt;"Plans for Russian Symphony Orchestra Season", ''New York Times'', 12 September 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Musical notes", ''New York Times'', 18 September 1910, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Their New York season began November 17 with a concert that included a very different interpretation of Rachmaninoff's ''Symphony No. 2'', which they had premiered in 1901 and which had meanwhile become a "celebrated" and much-played work. After discussions with the composer, Altschuler had sped up the tempi and his reading of the piece had "radically changed". The concert also featured two American premieres of pieces by [[Anatoly Lyadov]]—''Kikimora'' and ''Volshebnoye ozero (The Enchanted Lake)'', both written in 1909—Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture'', and several songs sung by German baritone [[Alexander Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Music World", ''New York Times'', 13 November 1910, p.X7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rachmininoff Again", ''New York Times'', 18 November 1910, p.9. This is the source for the word "celebrated".&lt;/ref&gt; The December 1 concert featured the U.S. debut of Canadian-born violinist [[Kathleen Parlow]]; the ''New York Times'' reviewer described her performance of Tchaikovsky's ''[[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]]'' as a "remarkable achievement" and praised her "unexpected authority",&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-11-27"&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 27 November 1910, p.X7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-12-02"&gt;"Russian Symphony Concert", ''New York Times'', 2 December 1910, p.9. This article, the one that refers to her "remarkable achievement", erroneously refers to ''Katherine'' Parlow.&lt;/ref&gt; and would have equally high praise for her "consummate technical accuracy&amp;hellip;beauty of tone&amp;hellip;spirit&amp;hellip;[and]fire" when she returned to play [[Henryk Wieniawski]]'s ''[[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Wieniawski)|Violin Concerto No. 2]]'' the following February 2.&lt;ref name="NYT 1911-02-03"&gt;"Miss Parlow Applauded", ''The New York Times'', 3 February 1911, p. 9. With reference to the Kajanus, the cited source simply says ''Finnish Rhapsody''. Kajanus wrote two ''Finnish Rhapsodies'', No. 1 in D minor, Op. 5 (1881) and No. 2 in F major (1886); there is no indication of which was performed on this occasion. Also, the ''Times'' refers again to the Rachmaninoff piece as ''The Cliff'' rather than ''The Rock''.&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was also the American premier of Stravinsky's ''[[Feu d'artifice]]'' (''Fireworks'').&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-11-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-12-02"/&gt; who had grown up largely in San Francisco and had become a professional musician in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.1-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Childhood and Education|publisher = Collections Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting four days later, they provided accompaniment for two-week run of [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s tragedy ''[[Mary Magdalene (Maeterlinck play)|Mary Magdalene]]'' at [[Century Theatre (New York City)|The New Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"'Mary Magdalene' for New Theatre", ''New York Times'', 25 November 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display ad, ''New York Times'', 5 December 1910, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the world premiere of that play, and the first U.S. performance of any Maeterlinck play.&lt;ref&gt;"Busy Nights for Playgoers", ''New York Times'', 4 December 1910, p.X1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 19, 1911 concert featured German-Polish pianist and composer [[Xaver Scharwenka]] as the soloist on his own ''Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor'', as well as the American premiere of the Introduction and Wedding Procession from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; the concert also featured Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)#Related works|Christmas Eve Suite]]'' and the American premiere of a waltz that Tchaikovsky had written for ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' but omitted from the final version, and closed with Tchaikovsky's ''[[Marche Slave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Music Here and There", ''The New York Times'', 1 Jan 1911, p.

'''''Saint Augustine in His Study''''' is a painting of [[Augustine of Hippo]] executed in 1480 by the [[Italian Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]]. It is in the church of [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] in [[Florence]].

Botticelli was born in a house in the same street as the church, still called Via Borgo Ognissanti.  He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1464 Botticelli's father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro took over in 1470 and lived in for the rest of his life.  Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including [[Amerigo Vespucci]], born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named.  The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was commissioned by the Vespucci family, probably Amerigo's father Nastaglio, a [[notary]], and his brother Giorgio Antonio, both neighbours of Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Someone else, probably the order running the church,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] to do a facing ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|Saint Jerome]]''; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition "was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 73–78, 74 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which mark them as scholars and precursors of [[Renaissance Humanism]].  There is known to have been a small painting of Jerome in his study said to have been by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the Medici collection, which is now lost.  This may have influenced both frescos.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

They decorated the screen of the unusually located choir, which was demolished in 1564–1566, when they were detached and moved to the nave.  They are now in the refectory, moved there after sustaining slight damage in the [[1966 flood of the Arno]].  In the first move part of the frame with its inscriptions went lost, and all of Jerome's.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 74–76; Legouix, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It portrays [[Augustine of Hippo]] in meditation inside his study.  The precise subject is a legend, probably first found in the 13th century, of a vision Augustine had as he began to write a letter to [[Jerome]] in his study at Hippo in 420.  The time is shown on the clock by his head as the end of the twenty-fourth hour, counting from the previous sunset.  This is the hour of [[Compline]], specified in the legend.  A light and sweet odour came into his study and a voice told him that "he might as soon enclose the ocean in a small vessel, as soon clasp the whole earth in his fist, as soon halt the movement of the heavens as describe the beatitude of the saints without having experienced it", as the speaker was now doing.  When Augustine asked who he was, he replied he was Jerome. Augustine later heard that Jerome had died in [[Jerusalem]] at exactly that hour.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 76–77, 77 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms visible in the upper part is that of the Vespucci family; Jerome has no equivalent arms.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines in the book over the saint's head are mostly meaningless, apart from a line in which reads: ''Dov'è Frate Martino? È scappato. E dov'è andato? È fuor dalla [[Porta al Prato]]'' ("Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato"), probably referring to the escapades of one of the [[Humiliati|Uumiliati]], the order who ran the church.  Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77 (different translation to same effect)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Piran's Flag''' ({{lang-kw|Baner Peran}}) is the flag of [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. The earliest known description of the flag as the [[Heraldic standard|Standard]] of Cornwall was written in 1838.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=oYYvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA332&amp;dq=formerly+the+banner+of+St.+Perran 'The Parochial History of Cornwall', by Davies Gilbert. (1838) Vol III, p. 332]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by some [[Cornish people]] as a symbol of their identity.&lt;ref name=rendle&gt;[http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Phil%20Rendle.pdf Phil Rendle, Cornwall – The Mysteries of St Piran, The Flag Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a white cross, which has a similar design to that of [[Saint George's Cross|Saint George]] on the [[Flag of England|English flag]], that is laid on top of a black background.

The flag is attributed to [[Saint Piran]], a 6th-century Cornish abbot. One early use of a white cross and black background design is the 15th-century coat of arms of the Saint-Peran family.&lt;ref&gt;P. POTIER de COURCY, Nobiliaire et armorial de Bretagne, A. Aubry, 1862, p390&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant]] in June 2012, the flag was among those flown on [[Gloriana (barge)|the Royal Barge, ''Gloriana'']], though this was explained as "innocent" and "nothing constitutional".&lt;ref name="Western Morning News"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505071742/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Mystery-Cornish-flag-jubilee-boat-solved/story-16366581-detail/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There are claims that the design dates from prior to 1188 when the flag was used in the [[Crusades]],&lt;ref name=celticleague&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.celticleague.org/flags.html| title= The Six Celtic Flags| website=celticleague.org| dead-url=yes| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523001540/http://www.celticleague.org/flags.html| archive-date=23 May 2006| access-date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' tells that the flag was carried by the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] contingent at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415).&lt;ref&gt;Heraldry Society Flag Section Newsletter, Autumn 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-corn.html Cornish flag]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}} However, the reference given by the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' seems to have been confused with one that comes from a 1590 poem entitled ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' by [[Michael Drayton]]. It states that the banner carried by the Cornish men at Agincourt depicted two [[Cornish Wrestling|Cornish wrestlers]] in a hitch.&lt;ref&gt;''Poly-Olbion'' by Michael Drayton&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known evidence of this flag was recorded by [[Davies Gilbert]] in his 1838 work: ''The [[Wikt:parochial|Parochial]] History of Cornwall'', in which he gives reference to

&lt;blockquote&gt;a white cross on a black ground [that] was formerly the banner of St Perran and the Standard of Cornwall; probably with some allusion to the black ore and the white metal of tin&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt;&lt;ref name=rendle/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fact that Gilbert identifies it as being "formerly" a standard of Cornwall implies that he believed it to have been used before 1838.&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt; However, Gilbert did not leave a record of his background research, and referred only to his "recollection".&lt;ref name=rendle/&gt;

One of the oldest depictions of the flag can be seen in a stained glass window at [[Westminster Abbey]]. It was unveiled in 1888, in memory of the famous Cornish inventor and engineer [[Richard Trevithick]]. The window depicts [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] at the top and nine Cornish saints, Piran, [[Saint Petroc|Petroc]], Pinnock,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5453&lt;/ref&gt; Germanus, Julian, Cyriacus, [[Constantine (British saint)|Constantine]], [[Saint Non|Nonna]] and [[Geraint of Dumnonia|Geraint]] in tiers below. The head of St Piran appears to be a portrait of Trevithick himself, and the figure carries the banner of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/richard-trevithick Westminster Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clues to its origin==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
Saint Piran's Flag has similarities to the old [[The Kroaz Du (Black Cross)|Breton flag]] and the [[flag of Saint David]]. The cultural links between [[Brittany]], [[Wales]] and Cornwall are well recorded. Saint Piran's Flag is the negative image of the old Breton flag, a black cross on a white field. The flag of Saint David shares a black background with Saint Piran's Flag, but is surmounted by a gold, rather than a white, cross.

[[File:Kroaz Du.svg|The Standard of the Army of the Breton Duchy (cf. [[Kroaz Du]])|thumb]]
[[File:Flag of Saint David.svg|The Welsh [[Flag of Saint David]]|thumb]]
It has also been suggested that it may have been based on the arms of the [[Earl of Cornwall]], or the later [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; based on the arms of other Cornish families; or be linked with the black and white livery of the [[Knights of St John]].&lt;ref name=rendle/&gt;

==French and Breton family arms==
The arms of the Saint-Peran family in Brittany, show a white cross pattee on a black field.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several other French and Breton families also had [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] that bear a striking resemblance to the St Piran's flag:

==Usage==

The flag is often displayed on bumper stickers, and flying from buildings, including those of [[Cornwall Council]].&lt;ref name=suzylou&gt;[http://www.cornishstudies.com/index.php?q=node/10 How far has the “Cornish Revival” affected modern Cornwall?]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008211307/http://www.cornishstudies.com/index.php?q=node%2F10 |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is flown at most Cornish gatherings, such as the [[Gorseth Kernow]], [[St Piran's Day]] (5 March), [[Camborne]]'s Trevithick Day (April), [[Padstow]]'s [['Obby 'Oss festival]] (May), [[Helston]]'s [[Furry Dance|Flora Day]] (May), and at [[Rugby union in Cornwall|Cornish rugby]] matches. It is regularly seen around Cornwall on car stickers with the word ''[[Cornwall|Kernow]]'' (Cornish for Cornwall), and is used around the world as a symbol of the [[Cornish diaspora]] or overseas Cornish associations. It has been adapted for use in the logos of a number of organisations, such as the Cornwall district of the [[Methodist Church]], is used by a variety of Cornish businesses such as [[Ginsters]], and is seen on the design of the [[Cornish All Blacks]] rugby shirts as well as the [[Cornish Pirates]] rugby logo.&lt;ref name=suzylou/&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2015}}

At the [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant]] in June 2012, the flag was flown on [[Gloriana (barge)|the Royal Rowing Barge]] alongside the flags representing [[flag of England|England]], [[flag of Scotland|Scotland]], [[St Patrick's Cross|Northern Ireland]], [[flag of Wales|Wales]] and the [[flag of the Corporation of the City of London|City of London]]. One of the largest flags in the pageant was also St Piran's Flag, flown by the St Ives mackerel lugger ''Barnabas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/westcornwall/9745015.St_Ives_lugger_flies_the_flag_at_Jubilee_river_pageant/?ref=rss|title=St Ives lugger flies the flag at Jubilee river pageant|publisher=Falmouth Packet|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flags of [[Smith Island, Maryland]] and [[Tangier, Virginia]] incorporate St. Piran's cross in the upper-left [[canton (flag)|canton]] in recognition of the early settlers who came to the islands from Cornwall and Devon.

The '''Basilica of Saint Praxedes''' ({{lang-la|Basilica Sanctae Praxedis}}, {{lang-it|Basilica di Santa Prassede all’Esquillino}}), commonly known in Italian as '''Santa Prassede''', is an ancient [[titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] church and  [[minor basilica]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], located near the papal basilica of [[Saint Mary Major]]. The current [[Cardinal Priest]] of ''Titulus Sancta Praxedis'' is [[Paul Poupard]].

== History ==
The church in its current form was commissioned by [[Pope Hadrian I]] around the year 780, and built on top of the remains of a 5th-century structure and was designed to house the bones of [[Saint Praxedes]] ({{lang-it|S. Prassede}}) and [[Saint Pudentiana]] ({{lang-it|S. Pudenziana}}), the daughters of [[Saint Pudens]], traditionally [[St. Peter]]'s first Christian convert in Rome. The two female saints were murdered for providing Christian burial for early [[martyr]]s in defiance of Roman law. The basilica was enlarged and decorated by [[Pope Paschal I]] in c. 822.

Pope Paschal, who reigned 817-824, was at the forefront of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] started and advocated by the emperor [[Charlemagne]]. They desired to get back to the foundations of Christianity theologically and artistically. Paschal, thus, began two, linked, ambitious programs: the recovery of martyrs' bones from the [[catacomb]]s of Rome and an almost unprecedented church building campaign. Paschal dug up numerous skeletons and transplanted them to this church. The ''Titulus S. Praxedis'' was established by [[Pope Evaristus]], around 112.

The inscriptions found in Santa Prassede, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.&lt;ref&gt;V. Forcella, ''Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma,  dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI'' Volume II (Roma: Fratelli Bencini,  1873), pp. 489-524. &lt;/ref&gt;

The church provided the inspiration for [[Robert Browning]]'s poem "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church."

== Interior ==
[[File:Santa prassede rome.ogv|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Interior of Santa Prassede]]
The main altarpiece is a canvas of ''St Praxedes Gathering the Blood of the Martyrs'' (c. 1730-35) by [[Domenico Muratori]].

=== Mosaic ===
[[File:Byzantine mosaics, years 817-824.jpg|thumb|Byzantine mosaics, years 817-824]]
The most famous element of the church is the [[mosaic]] decorative program. Paschal hired a team of professional mosaicists to complete the work in the apse, the apsidal arch, and the triumphal arch. In the apse, Jesus is in the center, flanked by Sts. Peter and Paul who present Prassede and Pudenziana to God. On the far left is Paschal, with the square halo of the living, presenting a model of the church as an offering to Jesus. Below runs an inscription of Paschal's, hoping that this offering will be sufficient to secure his place in heaven.

On the apsidal arch are twelve men on each side, holding wreaths of victory, welcoming the souls into heaven. Above them are symbols of the four Gospel writers: Mark, the lion; Matthew, the man; Luke, the bull; and John, the eagle, as they surround a lamb on a throne, a symbol of Christ's eventual return to Earth.

Those  mosaics, as well as those in the Chapel of [[Saint Zeno]], a funerary chapel which Pope Paschal built for his mother, Theodora,&lt;ref name="chapel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arttrav.com/rome/santa-prassede-mosaics/ |title=The Chapel of Saint Zeno at Santa Prassede: mosaic revival and survival |publisher=ArtTrav |date= |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the best-known aspects of the church. Also noteworthy are ancient frescoes. Ascending a spiral staircase, one enters a small room, covered in scaffolding;  on the wall is a fresco cycle, dating most likely from the 8th century. The frescoes probably depict  the life-cycle of the name saint of the church, Praxedes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Pillar of the Flogging ===

[[File:Monti - santa Prassede colonna flagellazione  01396.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Column of the Flagellation.]]

Santa Prassede also houses an alleged segment of the pillar upon which [[Jesus]]  was [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged and tortured]] before his crucifixion in [[Jerusalem]]. The relic is alleged to have been retrieved in the early 4th century  by Saint [[Helena (empress)|Helena]] (mother of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]]) who at the age of eighty undertook a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]], where she founded churches for Christian worship and rescued relics associated with the crucifixion of Jesus on [[Calvary]]. 

Among these legendary relics retrieved by Helena, which included pieces of the [[True Cross]] (now venerated at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm Basilica of St. Peter],&lt;/ref&gt; with fragments in [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]], also in Rome) and wood from the Jesus' crib enshrined at S. Maria Maggiore.  The authenticity of these relics, including the Santa Prassede pillar, is disputed by historians, due to lack of forensic evidence and the proliferation of falsified relics during the [[Middle Ages]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Titulus ==
Among known titulars of this see are Lambertus Scannabecchi (later [[Pope Honorius II]], c. 1099), Ubaldo Allucingoli (later [[Pope Lucius III]], 1141), [[Alain de Coëtivy]] (1448), Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (later [[Pope Julius III]], 1542-1543), Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] (1538-1584), [[Rafael Merry del Val]] (1903-1930).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d1p11.html ''S. Prassede (Cardinal Titular Church)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including ten [[BAFTA Television Awards]], one for editing in 1989 and two [[Emmy|Emmy Awards]] in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British TV scoops Emmys |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=26 November 1986 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series featured puppet [[caricature]]s of [[celebrities]] prominent during the 1980s and 1990s, including British Prime Ministers [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] and other politicians, US president [[Ronald Reagan]], and the [[British Royal Family]]; the series was the first to caricature [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (as an elderly gin-drinker with a [[Beryl Reid]] voice).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26329273 "Spitting Image creator John Lloyd: 'Television lacks satire'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132129/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26329273 |date=3 April 2015 }}.

One of the most-watched shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the series was a satire of politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era, and at its peak it was watched by 15 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1444231,00.html?redirection=gallery "Spitting Image"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118084335/https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1444231,00.html?redirection=gallery |date=18 January 2017 }}. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The series was cancelled in 1996, after viewing figures declined. ITV had plans for a new series in 2006, but these were scrapped after a dispute over [[Ant &amp; Dec]] puppets used to host ''Best Ever Spitting Image'', which were created against Roger Law's wishes.&lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a39486/ant-and-dec-stunt-ends-spitting-image-return.html|title=Ant and Dec stunt ends 'Spitting Image' return|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 November 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912082824/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a39486/ant-and-dec-stunt-ends-spitting-image-return.html|archivedate=12 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Law donated his entire archive – including original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=“archives”&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image archives donated to Cambridge University |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-46143333 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Grantham Museum Thatcher Spitting Image.jpg|thumb|right|Puppet of [[Margaret Thatcher]] on display in [[Grantham Museum]]]]
[[Martin Lambie-Nairn]] proposed a satirical television show featuring caricature puppets created by [[Peter Fluck]] and [[Roger Law]]. Fluck and Law, who had both attended the [[Anglia Ruskin University|Cambridge School of Art]], had no previous television experience, but had, for several years, constructed plasticine caricatures in order to illustrate articles in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Magazine.

The idea for the series was rejected by many in the industry, who thought it would only be suitable for children, but the series was finally accepted for development and first broadcast in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TV bosses rejected ''Spitting Image'' as 'kid's stuff' before hit show aired |first=Roya |last=Nikkhah, |date=18 November 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |work=The Telegraph |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424020930/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |archivedate=24 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English comedy writer and ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' editor [[Tony Hendra]], was brought in as a writer; Fluck and Law had met him while they were working in the US. Hendra brought in [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]], producer of ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]''. They were joined by [[Jon Blair]], a documentary producer. They then hired [[Muppet]] puppeteer [[Louise Gold]]. Development was funded by [[Clive Sinclair]].

The puppets, based on public figures, were designed by Fluck and Law, assisted by caricaturists that included [[David Stoten]], Pablo Bach, [[Steve Bendelack]] and [[Tim Watts (filmmaker)|Tim Watts]]. The episodes included musical parodies by [[Philip Pope]] (former member of ''[[Who Dares Wins (TV comedy)|Who Dares Wins]]'' and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]]) and later [[Steve Brown (composer)|Steve Brown]].

The first episode of ''Spitting Image'', in 1984, aired with a [[laugh track]], apparently at the insistence of Central Television. This episode was shown to a preview audience before transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latex Lampoonery (Spitting Image Giveaway Special, Part 1) |first=Mark |last=Jones |url=http://broken-tv.blogspot.com/2009/11/latex-lampoonery-spitting-image.html |work=Broken TV |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130711205149/http://broken-tv.blogspot.com/2009/11/latex-lampoonery-spitting-image.html |archivedate=11 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the show, ''Spitting Image'' was filmed and based in the enterprise zone at [[London Docklands]] at the [[Limehouse Studios]], where scriptwriters convened and puppets were manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://isleofdogslife.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/spitting-images-the-story-of-limehouse-television-studios/|title=Spitting Images – The Story of Limehouse Television Studios|date=2013-03-25|work=Isle of Dogs Life|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110114711/https://isleofdogslife.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/spitting-images-the-story-of-limehouse-television-studios/|archivedate=10 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/trm.61804.044|title=The Railway Metropolis|date=2016-01-01|publisher=ICE Publishing|isbn=0727761803|pages=44–53|doi=10.1680/trm.61804.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist [[Steve Nallon]] recalls that "they were able to get away with no health and safety, so all of the building of the puppets with all the toxic waste from the foam was just in a warehouse. There were no extractor fans; it was quite Dickensian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Steve Nallon #2 – 'Comedians are all lunatics' |date=28 September 2013 |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2013/09/interview-steve-nallon-2-comedians-are-all-lunatics/ |work=Giggle Beats |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928143948/http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2013/09/interview-steve-nallon-2-comedians-are-all-lunatics/ |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later series, ''Spitting Image'' was recorded at Central's studios in [[Nottingham]] with last minute additions being recorded at the [[Limehouse Studios]] at [[Canary Wharf]], London.

==Reception==
Before the first episode was broadcast, the parodies of the Royal Family were cut, as a courtesy to the Duke of Edinburgh, who opened the East Midlands television centre a few days later. The scenes were however all reinstated in later episodes.&lt;ref name="royalcut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal Family cut from TV satire |newspaper=The Times |date=25 February 1984 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode had an audience of 7.9 million, but numbers rapidly dropped, which meant economies had to be introduced since the series cost [[Pound sterling|£]]2.6 million, which was nearly double the price of other prime time series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spitting Image and Beyond |url=http://members.madasafish.com/~openbanana/puppets/page15.htm |work=The World of Puppets |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002171602/http://members.madasafish.com/~openbanana/puppets/page15.htm |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had been scheduled to have 13 episodes&lt;ref name="royalcut"/&gt; but was cut back to 12, after the series was nearly cancelled. [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]] were then brought in as head writers to save the show.

By 1986, under their supervision, ''Spitting Image'' had become popular, producing a number one song on the [[UK Singles Chart]] ("[[The Chicken Song]]"). However, Grant and Naylor subsequently left to create ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' for BBC2. ''Spitting Image'' had a short-running dispute with the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) in 1985, over the use of subliminal images.

===Evolution===
When [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in November 1990, her successor was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Major]]. This marked a shift in the show's style, with the writers moving from the Punch and Judy style to more subtle and atmospheric sketches, notably a series in which an awkward Major and wife Norma ate peas for dinner. The producers dressed Major, skin and all, in shades of grey, and invented an affair between him and [[Virginia Bottomley]].

The show added animated sketches from 1989 and again from 1994 (with short, animated segments before 1989). For the 1992 Election Special, a studio audience was used; this format was revisited for two episodes in late 1993. A spoof ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' took questions from the audience. The 1992 show was fronted by a puppet [[Robin Day]], a puppet [[Jeremy Paxman]] filling the role in the episodes broadcast on 14 November 1993 and 12 December 1993.

===Decline===

The face of the court Flunkey is a caricature of 18th century cartoonist [[James Gillray]], intended as a homage to the fact that he is the father of British political cartooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gillray_james.htm|title=James Gillray|author=|date=|website=lambiek.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110250/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gillray_james.htm|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The writers, [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]], Pete Sinclair, Stuart Silver, and Ray Harris quit the show in 1993 and in 1995, and with viewing figures in decline, production was cancelled.  The final series was in January and February 1996, with the final episode featuring "The Last Prophecies of Spitting Image" in which Labour moved into [[Number 10 Downing Street|Number 10]].

A few years later, most of the puppets were sold at an auction hosted by [[Sotheby's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 July 2000 |title=Online sale for TV puppets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/823080.stm |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030102044311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/823080.stm |archivedate=2 January 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a puppet of [[Osama Bin Laden]] never used in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2001 |title=Spitting Image to auction bin Laden |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1672791.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2004, the idea of the series coming back started to appear after John Lloyd held talks with ITV executives about the show's return. John Lloyd also held talks with a number of people who voiced the ''Spitting Image'' puppets, including John Sessions, Harry Enfield and Rory Bremner, with all responding positively.

Mr Lloyd commented, "There's enormous enthusiasm from ITV to do it. We're just trying to work out how it would be affordable. The budget is about to go off to ITV," he said. "Everybody seems to have residual affection for Spitting Image. It could be scrappy and uneven, but it's rather like a newspaper. You don't expect it to be brilliant every time, but there's something delicious in every edition," Mr Lloyd said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image back to haunt Blair |first=SUZY |last=AUSTIN |work=Metro |date=18 May 2004 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-303251/Spitting-Image-haunt-Blair.html#ixzz2cXP7k4sM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130820235637/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-303251/Spitting-Image-haunt-Blair.html%23ixzz2cXP7k4sM#ixzz2cXP7k4sM |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image plans TV comeback |first=Jason |last=Deans |work=MediaGuardian |date=17 May 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/17/broadcasting.uknews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529231058/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/17/broadcasting.uknews |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2006, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] were producing a documentary celebrating the series and if the audience figures were good a full series might have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politicians beware!

This special actually prevented ITV directly resurrecting the famous satire as they had planned, because it featured new puppets of [[Ant and Dec]] &amp;ndash; a move which was against the wishes of Roger Law, who owns the rights to the ''Spitting Image'' brand.&lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spitting Image return scuppered by Ant'n'Dec |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=16 November 2006 |url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/11/spitting-image-return-scuppered-by-antndec/ |work=The Stage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129004827/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/11/spitting-image-return-scuppered-by-antndec/ |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spitting Image'', as ITV's primary satirical programme, was succeeded by ''[[2DTV]]'', a cartoon format that had five series between 2001 and 2004. In 2008 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] created a CGI version to caricature and lampoon the famous, called ''[[Headcases]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITV to make CGI version of Spitting Image |date=17 May 2007 |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/old_story/191/ |work=British Comedy Guide |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924014840/http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/old_story/191/ |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it only aired for one series. Satirical puppets finally returned to ITV in 2015, in ''[[Newzoids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3030671/William-Kate-s-puppet-makeover-Duke-Duchess-Cambridge-royals-set-lampooned-ITV-s-newest-comedy-sketch-show.html|title=Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to be lampooned in ITV's Newzoids - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=1 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150410113436/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3030671/William-Kate-s-puppet-makeover-Duke-Duchess-Cambridge-royals-set-lampooned-ITV-s-newest-comedy-sketch-show.html|archivedate=10 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==

In April 2017, it was reported that US broadcaster [[HBO]] was set to revive the series in light of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]]. As of the report, no official confirmation or announcement was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2543/spitting_image_usa/|title=HBO to make Spitting Image series|date=22 April 2017|work=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=15 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021551/https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2543/spitting_image_usa/|archivedate=16 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive donated to Cambridge University==
In 2018, ''Spitting Image'' co-creator Roger Law donated his entire archive – which includes original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. The collection is located in the university library, with its librarian Dr Jessica Gardner describing the collection as a "[[national treasure]]".&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt; She added, "Spitting Image was anarchic, it was creative, it entered the public imagination like nothing else from that era. It is an extraordinary political and historical record. Great satire holds up a mirror, it questions and challenges."&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt;

==Broadcast dates==
All episodes and specials were broadcast on Sunday, usually at 10pm. The programme was also picked up overseas. It aired on Canada's [[CBC Television]] on Sunday nights in the late 1980s.  The American network [[NBC]] aired several prime-time specials in the same period. Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast ''Spitting Image'' in English with German subtitles late on Friday nights in approximately four-week intervals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, introducing it to the German-speaking world (where foreign programming is usually dubbed into German). ''Spitting Image'' was also briefly shown in France on the private TV channel [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] in English with French subtitles. The show was also aired in New Zealand on [[TVNZ]] in the 1980s.

==Repeats==
From October 1996 to September 1998, ''Spitting Image'' Series 1-11 were on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]], until September 1998. Edited episodes from Series 1-3 and 7 were on [[Plus (TV channel)|Granada Plus]] from 2001-2003.

In February 2008, [[Comedy Central Extra]] started showing regular repeats of ''Spitting Image'' from 9pm on Tuesday evenings, with a whole weekend's worth of evenings devoted to the first two series. It reappeared in a late night slot in November 2010, through to 18 December 2010 and has not been aired since then. From 2001 to 2004 the ITV series ''[[2DTV]]'' had a similar style, but using computer animation instead of puppets.

The programme is rebroadcast on the digital network "PuppeTV" as a part of its "Puppets After Dark" post - watershed slot. In 2011, the network dedicated an entire month to broadcasting all episodes of the show, from 10:00pm until 6:00am, including the 2006 clipshow special and the American specials, which they called "Spitting Image 24/7". 

===United States version===
{{See also |List of British TV shows remade for the American market |D.C. Follies}}
In an attempt to crack the American market, there were some attempts to produce a [[television in the United States|US version]] of the show. A 45-minute 'made for market' show by the original ''Spitting Image'' team, titled ''Spitting Image: Down and Out in the White House'' was produced in 1986 by Central for the [[NBC]] network.

Introduced by [[David Frost]], it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election. The plot involved a conspiracy to replace Ronald Reagan with a double (actually actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] in disguise). This plan was hatched by the Famous Corporation, a cabal of the ultra-rich headed by [[Johnny Carson]]'s foil [[Ed McMahon]] (in the show, Carson was his ineffectual left-hand man) who met in a secret cavern hollowed out behind the façade of Mount Rushmore. Eventually, their plot foiled, the famous corporation activated their escape pod &amp;ndash; Abraham Lincoln's nose &amp;ndash; and left Earth for another planet, but (in a homage to the beginning of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies) were destroyed during a collision with 'a nonsensical prologue in gigantic lettering'.

The show was not very successful with its target audience, possibly because its humour was still very British and it was so irreverent about Ronald Reagan at a time when he was enormously popular with the American public. It did, however, receive great praise from critics and it was followed by several more television specials: ''The Ronnie &amp; Nancy Show'' (also satirising the Reagans), ''The 1987 Movie Awards'' (sending up the [[Academy Awards]]), ''Bumbledown: The Life and Times of Ronald Reagan'' (a quasi-documentary about the President), and ''The Sound of Maggie'' (satirising Thatcher and parodying several musicals such as ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and many others).

==Characters==

===Politicians===
Many British politicians in parliament during [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s tenure were parodied.&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt; By far the most prominent was Thatcher herself, portrayed as an abusive tyrant and cross-dresser (she wore suits, shaved, used the urinals, was portrayed as a cigar-chomper and addressed by her Cabinet as "Sir"). The Thatcher puppet had a strong dislike of anything French (agreeing with Hitler about 'teaching those Frenchies where to go' and throwing an apple out of the window because it was French).

In the first series, Thatcher sought advice from her enraptured neighbour Herr Jeremy Von Wilcox (who is actually an elderly Adolf Hitler, living at 9 Downing Street) about the unions and the unemployed. Mr. Wilcox/Hitler compares the [[Trade unions]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and advises [[Operation Barbarossa#Weather|not to attack in winter]]. Regarding unemployment, he says that people out of work should be put in the army, and tells Thatcher that he thinks the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (meaning [[Special Air Service|SAS]]) are a "great bunch of guys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Spitting Image |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2DnW5uC1_A |accessdate=18 April 2013 |series=3 |credits= |network=ITV |year=1986 |number=1 |minutes=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523161940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2DnW5uC1_A |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Thatcher were her Cabinet, which included:

*[[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]], with fluffy eyebrows and wearing a tartan dressing gown to cabinet meetings.
*[[Nigel Lawson]], panicking about a financial crisis he had apparently caused. A real-life recession caused Lawson to step down in 1989. He is by far the worst of all the cabinet being completely unable to count to seventeen.
*[[Geoffrey Howe]], boring, bland and talked to [[sheep]].
*[[Douglas Hurd]], famous for his [[Dalek]]-style voice and his hair shaped like a "[[Mr Whippy]]" ice cream. Hurd seems also the most competent and humane one in the cabinet. Opposing the usage of torture and stopping the dumping of nuclear waste in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;''Comedy Connections: Spitting Image''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Norman Tebbit]], appearing as a leather-clad [[skinhead]] loyal to Thatcher, referring to her as "Leader" and often beating up other politicians.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;
*[[Michael Heseltine]], growing more manic with every series (and wearing a flak jacket as Defence Secretary).
*[[Leon Brittan]], constantly fawning towards Thatcher and often seen eating.
*[[Norman Fowler]], portrayed during his time as Health Secretary as a hospital-murdering [[Jack the Ripper]]-style lunatic.
*[[Cecil Parkinson]], having a sexual interest in every woman he sees.
*[[Edwina Currie]], portrayed as a vampire.
*[[Paul Channon]], childish.
*[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], transforming into a slug over the series.
*[[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], smoking and developing the countryside for houses.
*[[Kenneth Clarke]], obese and drunk despite being Minister for Health.
*[[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], spineless wimp
*[[David Waddington, Baron Waddington|David Waddington]], Fast talking and creepy
*[[Francis Pym]] and [[James Prior]], Wets who swam in swimming pools
*[[Colin Moynihan, 4th Baron Moynihan|Colin Moynihan]], minuscule and childlike, called "miniature for sport"
*[[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]], portrayed while Employment Secretary as [[The Invisible Man]]

Thatcher's Cabinet were often depicted as bickering schoolchildren, with Thatcher acting as teacher.

Thatcher's successor [[John Major]] was portrayed as a dull, boring grey character who enjoyed a meal of peas with his wife [[Norma Major|Norma]] and was constantly mocked by [[Humphrey (cat)|Humphrey]], the [[Downing Street]] cat. Before Thatcher's resignation, Major had been portrayed as wearing a leopard print suit and swinging in on a trapeze, referencing his background as the son of a circus acrobat (which he would frequently remind everyone about). Upon his appointment to Prime Minister, Major was initially portrayed as robotic with a spinning antenna on his head (it was explained in a sketch that Thatcher used it to control Major, standing behind Thatcher in the crowd of sycophantic cabinet members, eager to repeat whatever the Thatcher puppet screeched).

The [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]) politicians included:

*[[Neil Kinnock]], the 'Welsh Windbag', talking for hours about anything ''other'' than policies.
*[[Roy Hattersley]], spitting with every word because of his lisp (on 'Best Ever Spitting Image', Hattersley praised his puppet for 'putting the spit into ''Spitting Image''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/roy-hattersley-wife-divorce-after-1827552 |first=Ben |last=Rossington |title=Roy Hattersley and wife divorce after 57 YEARS |work=Daily Mirror |date=12 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218235030/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/roy-hattersley-wife-divorce-after-1827552 |archivedate=18 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Michael Foot]], aged and senile, ending sentences with "Yes! Argh!".
*[[Tony Benn]], a rampant socialist with eyes that never looked in the same direction.
*[[Ken Livingstone]], whose living room was filled with salamanders and snakes.
*[[Denis Healey]], with giant eyebrows, who helped to make Kinnock look foolish (the real Healey appeared in the programme in 1984).
*[[Gerald Kaufman]], portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-style maniac.

[[Arthur Scargill]], who was a member of the Labour Party until 1997, appeared as head of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], and was portrayed as a big-nosed egotist who was ignorant about mining.

In 1994, a puppet of [[Tony Blair]] made his appearance. He was originally a public school boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was "I'M THE LEADER" in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced with an even bigger smile if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, [[John Prescott]], was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along with a squeaky voiced [[Robin Cook]], and an enormous glasses-wearing [[Jack Straw]].

The [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] was portrayed by the election-losing, [[populism|populist]], arrogant and undecided [[David Owen]], with whining, bedwetting [[David Steel]] in his pocket.  They were soon replaced by [[Paddy Ashdown]], whose "equidistance" from the larger parties was satirised by his frequent appearance at the side of the screen during unrelated sketches, saying: "I am neither in this sketch nor not in it, but somewhere in-between". This running gag was used when Ashdown's extramarital affair was revealed, and his puppet commented that "I didn't touch her on the left leg, or the right leg, but somewhere in-between." Former liberal MP [[Cyril Smith]] also made a few appearances depicted as morbidly obese.

Former Prime Ministers [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] were depicted as living in a highly restrictive retirement home named Exchequers, where they were frequently abused by [[Queen Victoria]]. Wilson constantly attempted escape, whilst Callaghan took delight in tormenting him. [[Edward Heath]] was also said to have resided there, but he was not seen on screen.

===Royal Family===
The main characters were:
*[[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]: wears a [[CND]] badge, always seemed slightly mad and picked clothes from rubbish bins
*[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], the Queen's husband; was a [[blunderbuss]]-toting Greek-obsessed buffoon in [[Royal Navy|naval]] uniform
*[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was a pseudo-hippie, then a taxi driver in later episodes
*[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] was a publicity-hungry [[Sloane Ranger]]
*[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], who was generally seen with a bottle of [[Gordon's Gin]], a copy of the ''[[Racing Post]]'', and a [[Beryl Reid]] voice; this was a running joke from a sketch in which the Royal Family's desire to conceal her [[Birmingham]] accent was the reason she was very seldom heard speaking on television. In the series she is seen with [[jockey]] [[Lester Piggott]] with whom she has an affair.

Other members who were parodied include: [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], [[Sarah, Duchess of York|The Duchess of York]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], [[Princess Michael of Kent]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], who was always tipsy.

===International politicians===
Spitting Image lampooned [[President of the United States of America|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] as a bumbling, [[nuclear weapon|nuke]]-obsessed fool in comparison with his advisors [[Edwin Meese]] and [[Caspar Weinberger]]. Next to his bed were red buttons labelled 'Nuke' and 'Nurse'. His wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] was the butt of [[cosmetic surgery]] jokes.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had his forehead birthmark in the shape of hammer and sickle. All other Russians looked like [[Leonid Brezhnev]], often said "da" ("yes") and talked about [[potato]]es. In Russia it was snowing even indoors and the Soviet television had extremely low-tech visual effects.

[[François Mitterrand]] was wearing a beret and a garlic wreath. [[P. W. Botha]] was shown as a racist cleverly disguising his views (once he had a badge "anti-anti-[[apartheid]]"). [[Adolf Hitler]] incognito had a house at [[9 Downing Street]]. Some appearances were also made by [[Idi Amin]], [[Robert Mugabe]], [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]].

Other international caricatures included [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]; [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Dan Quayle]]; [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Konstantin Chernenko]], [[Raisa Gorbachova]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].

===Sport===

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]]]]
England manager [[Bobby Robson]] was a senile worrier nicknamed 'Rubbisho'. England midfielder [[Paul Gascoigne]] appeared, frequently crying – a parody of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] semi-final against West Germany in which he famously cried after being booked, which would have ruled him out of the final had England won the game.

[[Ian Botham]] was a violent drug addict, while [[Mike Gatting]] spoke with a high voice. [[Lester Piggott]] had to be subtitled. Boxing characters included [[Frank Bruno]] with his trademark laugh and catchphrase "where's [[Harry Carpenter|'Arry]]?", and [[Chris Eubank]], with his lisp. Snooker player [[Steve Davis]] was boring, upset because he had no nickname, but thought himself interesting.

===Celebrities===
News reporters were also depicted. [[Alastair Burnet]] was sycophantic towards the Royal Family and with a nose that inflated. [[Sandy Gall]] was effeminate, always worrying what coat he would wear. [[John Cole (journalist)|John Cole]] was incomprehensible and had to be dragged off-screen when he talked too long. [[Nicholas Witchell]] was always turning up during a strike to work rather than report. [[Kate Adie]] was a thrill-seeker, [[BBC]] Head of Bravery. [[Jeremy Paxman]] appeared as uninterested and self-loving. [[William Rees-Mogg]] was portrayed as a censorship-crazy person with eyes that would frequently pop out of the socket.

[[David Coleman]] had a very loud ear prompter and sometimes did not know what he was commentating on. [[Frank Bough]] was portrayed as being a drug user. [[Bruce Forsyth]] spoke every sentence as though it was a [[catchphrase]]. Film critic [[Barry Norman]] was not a fan of his puppet, because it had a [[wart]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;''Best Ever Spitting Image:'' TV Documentary. Released 25 June 2006 (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Daniels]] did not mind jokes about his [[toupée]] but took offence to a sketch depicting him nuzzling his assistant [[Debbie McGee]]'s breasts.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=English |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Victims+of+a+puppet+state%3B+BEST+EVER+SPITTING+IMAGE+SUNDAY,+STV,...-a0147401155 |title=Victims of a puppet state: Best ever Spitting Image |date=24 June 2006 |work=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Billy Connolly]] was portrayed as a jester, and [[Jimmy Tarbuck]] was said to use old jokes and always take part in [[Royal Variety Performance]]. [[Bernard Manning]] was an obese racist, [[Ben Elton]] was always shown with a microphone. Writer and MP [[Jeffrey Archer]] appeared as an annoying, self-commenting writer whose books were not read by anyone. [[Alan Bennett]] was shown at home as watching ''Spitting Image'' on TV.

A [[Mick Jagger]] character seemed perpetually high, and [[Keith Richards]] so old and haggard that he thought he was dead. [[Ringo Starr]] was a drunkard, and [[Paul McCartney]] was always releasing albums and films that flopped. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] changed her hair and clothes with every episode, and [[Michael Jackson]]'s skin turned lighter. [[Luciano Pavarotti]] was hugely overweight and ate everything he saw. [[Cilla Black]] had large teeth and a thick [[Scouse]] accent.

Actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] spoke nasally and was parodied for his [[method acting]]. [[John Gielgud]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] were lamenting their friends, even their own death. [[Roger Moore]] was shown as an actor "with a wooden delivery" – only his eyebrows moved. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was muscle-bound but insecure about the size of his genitals. [[Donald Sinden]] was parodied as also trying to become the greatest Shakespearian actor and get a knighthood. [[Clint Eastwood]] was frequently portrayed as a badass tough guy.

Archbishop [[Robert Runcie]], [[Mary Whitehouse]] and [[Cliff Richard]] were portrayed as Christian censors. [[Ian Paisley]] was always shouting and dressed in black. [[Pope John Paul II]] was a banjo-playing [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womaniser]] who spoke with a Texan accent.

Media moguls [[Robert Maxwell]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]] were also on the show, the latter depicted as an extremely [[flatulent]] individual encouraging obscenity in his mass media.

[[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] appeared in various background roles often as a bar tender.

==The songs==
[[File:SpittingImage albumcover.jpg|thumb|Spitting Image album cover for "Da Do Run Ron" satirical parody of [[Ronald Reagan]]|200px]]

The first single from ''Spitting Image'', released in 1984, was a rework of the [[The Crystals|Crystals]]' "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/e9713|title=45cat - Spitting Image - Da Do Run Ron / Just A Prince Who Can't Say No - Elektra - UK - E 9713|work=45cat.com|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Spitting Image'' version, "Da Do Run Ron", was a spoof election campaign song for [[Ronald Reagan]], featuring [[Nancy Reagan]] listing reasons why "you gotta re-elect him", with lyrics like "Yeah! He can really act, Yeah! He lowered income tax, Yeah! He hates the [[Warsaw Pact]]". The cover of the single featured Reagan as a biker with Nancy riding pillion.

The B-side of this single was entitled "Just A Prince Who Can't Say No" and poked fun at the sexual indiscretions of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Prince Andrew]]. The TV version of this song (featured in the second ever episode) was heavily censored by Central Television on broadcast but presented uncut on vinyl.&lt;ref name="dadorunron"&gt;[http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Da_Do_Run_Ron.htm Da Do Run Ron] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152013/http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Da_Do_Run_Ron.htm |date=8 December 2008 }} on {{cite web |url=http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611092139/http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/ |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series he was shown surrounded by various famous women including [[Joan Collins]], [[Mary Whitehouse]] and [[Linda McCartney]].

In 1986, the ''Spitting Image'' puppets had a number one hit in the UK charts with "[[The Chicken Song]]", parodying "[[Agadoo]]" by [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]] – one of several parodies to have featured in the programme, mimicking moronic holiday songs with an annoyingly unforgettable tune and completely nonsensical lyrics. The Chicken Song hit number 1 in the charts for 3 weeks from 17 May 1986 – 3 June 1986 and VH1 US named it as one of the worst number 1 nominations.

The other songs released by ''Spitting Image'' were "[[I've Never Met a Nice South African]]" (which was on the B-Side of "The Chicken Song" and was a savage indictment of the [[apartheid]]-ridden country), "We're Scared Of Bob" (a parody of "[[We Are The World]]") and "Hello You Must Be Going" (which mocked [[Phil Collins]]'s divorce ballads and was on the 12" release of The Chicken Song), "Santa Claus Is On The Dole" (backed with "The Atheist Tabernacle Choir"), "The Christmas Singles" and "Cry Gazza Cry" (based on footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]]'s tears in the 1990 World Cup), "Meat" (A parody of "[[Streets of London (song)|Streets of London]]").

"The Chicken Song" was by far the most successful of all of their music and not-so-subtle references were made to it in subsequent sketches in the show itself. In 1986, a compilation LP "Spit In Your Ear" was produced, featuring some of their sketches over time along with a few of their songs, followed in 1990 by "20 Great Golden Gobs", a songs-only collection from the 1986-1990 series.

In 1986, the ''Spitting Image'' team experienced some real musical success when they created the video for "[[Land of Confusion]]" by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], a song which implied that Thatcher and Reagan were about to bring the world to a nuclear war. [[Phil Collins]] saw a disfigured version of himself on the show and contacted the show's producers with the idea to produce the video. Three new puppets were created depicting all members of Genesis (including a less exaggerated version of Collins), which also appear on the sleeve of the 45 (and later CD) single. The video was depicted as a nightmare Reagan was having, which left him completely immersed in sweat from worrying. It won a 1987 Grammy Award.

The end of the 1987 election featured a young boy, dressed as a city banker, singing "[[Tomorrow Belongs To Me]]", a parody of the film ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', when a member of the [[Hitler Youth]] starts singing the same song.  In a series 5 episode, Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune "My eyes are fully open" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ruddigore]]'', supported by members of his shadow cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rJW2P2rFY "Neil Kinnock in Spitting Image - Series 5"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218094259/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rJW2P2rFY |date=18 February 2016 }}, 1988, YouTube, uploaded 26 March 2009, accessed 16 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was persuaded to sing a re-worded version of "[[Every Breath You Take]]", titled "[[Every Bomb You Make]]" (series 1, episode 12), to accompany a video showing the ''Spitting Image'' puppets of world leaders and political figures of the day, usually with the figure matching the altered lyrics "''Every bomb you make. Every job you take. Every heart you break, every Irish wake. I'll be watching you. Every wall you build, Every one you've killed, Every grave you've filled, all the blood you've spilled, I'll be watching you.''" The video ended with the [[grim reaper]] appearing in front of a sunset. This version was due to be resurrected by Sting at the [[Live 8]] concert, and the parody lyrics were cleared with their writers Quentin Reynolds and James Glen, but plans were abandoned at the last minute.

The end theme of series 8 episode 3 all the characters performing the tribute song [[Jeremy Beadle]] and they sang about they hated him until his death in 2008. The end theme of series 9 episode 4 was "[[Why Can't Life Be Like Hello?]]", sung by [[June Brown]] (commonly known as the EastEnders character [[Dot Cotton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Spitting Image (series 9, episode 4): {{bulleted list| {{cite web| url= http://ftvdb.BFI.org.UK/sift/title/486696?view=synopsis| title= SPITTING IMAGE: SPITTING IMAGE[03/05/92] (1992)| accessdate= 24 January 2013| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140202170556/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/486696?view=synopsis| archivedate= 2 February 2014| df= dmy-all}}| {{cite web| url= http://GoodSeri.es/shows/spitting-image/seasons/9| title= Season 9 : Spitting Image| accessdate= 24 January 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140201231740/http://goodseri.es/shows/spitting-image/seasons/9| archivedate= 1 February 2014| df= dmy-all}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The song pastiches [[Hello (magazine)|''Hello'' magazine]], in satire of post-[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] UK [[consumerist culture]].

Other musical parodies featured [[Mick Jagger]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[The Monkees]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Brett Anderson]] of [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Björk]], [[East 17]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

==Staff==

==Video and DVD releases==
The programme was first released on video in 1986 in a series of three collections, each a compilation of material from the first two series: ''Spit - With Polish!'', ''A Floppy Mass Of Blubber'' &amp; ''Rubber Thingies''. All carried a 15 certificate and were reissued in 1988, also as a box set.  1989 saw the release by Central Video of two complete specials, ''Bumbledown: The Life &amp; Times Of Ronald Reagan'' and ''The Sound Of Maggie''. Next was a video containing a collection of the music videos from the programme, titled "The Klassik Music Video Vol 1", released in 1991 by Central Video under The Video Collection Ltd (VCI or 2entertain); there was never a Volume 2.

"Is Nothing Sacred?" was released in 1992 by Surprise Video, compiling material from 1990-1991. The free booklet was written by [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]]. ''Havin' It Off: The Bonker's Guide'' was released in 1993. In 1996 ''FA to Fairplay'' was released on VHS, later reissued on DVD in 2005. Made specially for video, it provided an alternative look at the 1996 European [[football (soccer)|football]] championship held in England.

The Ronald Reagan song "Da Do Run Ron" featured in a straight to video release called ''Rockin' Ronnie'' (1986), an otherwise unrelated compilation of movie clips released by ATI Video.

The first twelve series including An 11-disc set (containing the first 7 series broadcast 1984-89) have been released by [[Network Distributing]] under licence by [[ITV Studios]], so far. Series 1-7 individual releases are now deleted .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=539|title=Spitting Image: The Complete Series 1|publisher=Network DVD|accessdate=7 December 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213122120/http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=539|archivedate=13 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD releases do not include any of the specials made.

[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tom Thomson]], ''The Jack Pine'' (1916–17). Oil on canvas; 127.9 × 139.8 cm. [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa]]

'''''The Jack Pine''''' is a well-known [[oil painting]] by [[Canadian art]]ist [[Tom Thomson]]. A representation of the most broadly distributed [[pine]] species in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/dendrology/index/plantae/vascular/seedplants/gymnosperms/conifers/pine/pinus/contortae/jack/jackpine.html ncsu]&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered an iconic image of the country's landscape,&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the country's most widely recognized and reproduced artworks.

The painting was completed in 1917, the year of Thomson's death. It is a roughly square canvas that measures 127.9&amp;nbsp;× 139.8 cm. It has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] since 1918. 

==Background==
[[File:Tom Thomson - Pine Island, Georgian Bay.jpg|thumb|Foreground trees and a distant body of water form a common motif in Thomson's work. In this regard ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16) is a precursor to ''The Jack Pine'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson (2002), 40&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Beginning in 1913, Thomson annually stayed in [[Algonquin Park]] from the spring until the autumn, often working as a guide while also fishing and painting for his own pleasure. In 1916, he also worked in the Park as a fire ranger.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It was there, on Grand Lake with the hills near Carcajou Bay in the background, that Thomson made the oil [[study (art)|sketch]] in 1916 that he would use for the final painting in 1917.&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Murray, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other paintings by Thomson with compositions similar to that of ''The Jack Pine'': in fact, the majority of Thomson's canvasses depict the far side of a shore.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  These include ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13), his first; ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16; pictured); and more famously, ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' (1917), another painting of iconic status.&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a [[jack pine]] as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset.&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed during his years as a graphic designer,&lt;ref&gt;Marlow, Kirk. "[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e2580 Thomson, Tom]." The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance.&lt;ref name="NGC"&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes.&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.

The final canvas differs markedly from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson'' (2002), pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; He made the tree appear larger by lowering the hills on the far side of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were echoed in the heavy, swirling brushwork of the sky and the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague [[Lawren Harris]].&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt;

Thomson began with a [[vermilion]] red undertone, which he likely chose to avoid mixing the [[complementary colour]]s red and green. The red was allowed to show through in parts of the tree, foreground landscape, and hills,&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt; making the colour "[seem] to vibrate".&lt;ref&gt;p. 79 in Murray, Joan (1998). ''Tom Thomson: Design For a Canadian Hero''. Dundurn Press. {{ISBN|1550023152}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet the focal point of the painting is not in the foreground, but at the distant shore—the patch of snow just below the centre of the canvas. Dennis Reid, who wrote a booklet on the painting for the National Gallery, points out an almost circular shape made by the foreground elements that encompass the focal point. The circle is formed from the large curving branches of the tree, the sloping left foreground, and the smaller tree at right. Reid writes&lt;!--haha--&gt; that this near-circle "exists in space more like a ball, and as we peer through that ball to the opposite shore, for an instant we're inside our eye."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson's background in design lent his composition an [[Art Nouveau|Art-Nouveau]] sensibility. One reviewer notes the effect in it and ''The West Wind'': "[these] two best-known canvases&amp;nbsp;... are essentially ''Art Nouveau'' designs in the flat, the principal motif in each case being a tree drawn in great sinuous curves&amp;nbsp;... Such pictures, are, however, saved from complete stylization by the use of uncompromisingly native subject-matter and of Canadian colours, the glowing colours of autumn."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of R. H. Hubbard (1962), in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[A. Y. Jackson]], Thomson was dissatisfied with the canvas, particularly the background and sky.&lt;ref name="M1"/&gt;

== Interpretation ==

Tom Thomson had little to say about ''The Jack Pine'' or his painting in general. ''The Jack Pine'', a stylized landscape with few elements&amp;nbsp;– painted by a man who died the year he painted it, a man who would become an icon in his country&amp;nbsp;— has encouraged various readings of Thomson's artistic motivations. Dennis Reid observes the limitations of received views of such popular artworks: "''The Jack Pine'', is, after all, like all successful works of art a living thing that grows or declines, unfolds or closes up, according to the nature and the quality of the attention it receives. In that sense, there are as many meanings as there are viewers."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blodwen Davies]] was the first biographer of Thomson, and a [[Theosophist]]. Emphasizing the "spirit" of the painting, she wrote in 1935, "the spirit of the canvas leaps out to meet the spectator in a way no reproduction can fully convey. There is no fumbling, no hesitancy here&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson's] brush was sure. Heavily laden with paint it swept over the canvas in broad, exultant strokes in which the very spirit of Tom Thomson still speaks aloud."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Another Theosophist, Fred Housser, described the painting in 1926 as "a devotional meditative study. A single tree stands spreading the tracery of its limbs and branches like the pulsating veins of Mother Nature&amp;nbsp;... [One] could believe that this tree was to the nature-worshipper Thomson what the symbol of the cross was to a mediaeval mystic."&lt;ref name="r26"&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson was an important influence on the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], with members such as [[Lawren Harris]] advocating his work. In a review of the Art Gallery of Toronto's Inaugural Exhibition of 1926, Harris dismissed much of the American art shown there, writing that most of it "represented the average of the academies... no one of these canvasses&lt;ref&gt;Harris reserved praise only for [[Arthur B. Davies]] and [[Rockwell Kent]] with respect to American art at the exhibition. (Larisey)&lt;/ref&gt; approaches Thomson's ''The West Wind'' or ''Jack Pine'' in devotion and greatness of spirit." Those two paintings, he wrote, "contain the lasting qualities of the best old masters. The devotional mood of ''The Jack Pine'' is the same as in [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child''".&lt;ref&gt;Larisey, Peter. ''Light for a Cold Land: Lawren Harris's Work and Life – An Interpretation''. Toronto: Dundern Press, 1993. {{ISBN|1-55002-188-5}}. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Arthur Lismer]], also part of the Group of Seven, commented on Thomson's painting. Writing in 1930, he stated that ''The Jack Pine'' was a work of "significant form&amp;nbsp;... The artist thinks of big things first&amp;nbsp;– and the design in this picture is the biggest thing in it. It is like a symphony of music. All the instruments are playing a part, and none is out of harmony with the whole&amp;nbsp;... the theme of a painting is a movement in space. The upright lines of the tree trunk give it serenity; the horizontal lines of the shore supplement this and give it strength; the rounded masses of the hills repeat the circular rhythm of the foliage masses, giving movement and powerful rhythm to the whole composition."&lt;ref name="r26"/&gt;

Peter Mellen, author of ''The Group of Seven'' (1970), wrote of the work's "perfect serenity. It is evening&amp;nbsp;– the sky and lake are perfectly calm and are painted in broad, flat horizontal strokes. Even the soft mauves, pinks, and greens contribute to this effect. Countering the strong horizontals are the drooping red tendrils of the bare pine branches, the vertical lines of the trees, and the curves of the hills&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson] achieves pure poetry in painting, by combining an intuitive feeling for nature with an almost classical control of technique."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Jean Boggs proposed that Thomson was influenced by the European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]]: "against the dying light and sky the scraggly forms of ''The Jack Pine'' are most dramatic, its branches struggling to life but dominated by dark-green, tattered, bat-like forms as if the tree were a symbol&amp;nbsp;– beautiful, oriental, but a symbol nevertheless of Thomson's wish for his own death on this spot."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Others considered the painting evidence that Thomson was, or might have become, an increasingly [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[expressionism|Expressionist]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 29; Grace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance and exhibition ==

The [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] has held the work since shortly after its creation. During his wilderness travels, Thomson likely stored ''The Jack Pine'' in his shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]]. In late 1917, Dr. Norm MacCallum, Thomson's patron, put it and a few other works by Thomson on display at the [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts and Letters Club]]. Representatives of the National Gallery visited the club on two occasions in the spring of 1918. The museum wished to add to its existing collection of three works by Thomson. Director Eric Brown was appalled on his first visit at the poor lighting provided the paintings. For the second visit, May 2, the display had been improved, and the director and his associate chose ''The Jack Pine'' (along with Thomson's ''Autumn Garland'' and 25 sketches) for the National Gallery. Brown wrote to a colleague that ''The Jack Pine'' was "in our opinion, and that of Thomson's fellow painters, the best picture of any kind he ever painted."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after ''The Jack Pine'' arrived in Ottawa in August 1918, it was sent to St. Louis, Missouri, as part of an exhibition of contemporary [[Canadian art]]. It circulated until 1919, and only in February 1920 was the painting first displayed in Canada, as part of a Thomson memorial exhibition. In the next five decades it would be displayed widely, in Europe (London, Paris, Ghent), and across Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Jack Pine'' was included in an exhibition of Thomson's work that travelled across Canada in 2003, organized by the National Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;A 140-plate book on Thomson was published in 2002 to coincide with the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then shown at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/09/thomsonhermitage040909.html Iconic Tom Thomson works showcased at Russia's Hermitage].

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Tom Thomson Jack Pine Achray Algonquin Park Ontario Canada.jpg|thumb|150px|The site of Thomson's sketch for the painting, photographed in 2007]]

''The Jack Pine'', with other works by Thomson, has become an iconic representation of the [[Canadian geography|Canadian landscape]]. Thomson's life and mysterious death is a popular subject of Canadian biography and poetry. Even ''The Jack Pine'' is a title referent in a few poems, including [[Henry Beissel]]'s "Tom Thomson's Jackpine" and Doug Barbour's "Tom Thomson's 'The Jack Pine' (1916–1917)".&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Beissel's poem concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
... the light is at peace with the tree and the lake.
Calmly it amplifies the beryline silence brooding
on the waters where Tom's spirit rests forever
alongside the sky stretched out in the shadow
of the jackpine that holds heaven and earth
together in an embrace encompassing the hills
the lake, the seasons, and the void that fills
the dark spaces between them and infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in full in [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9CfKx7SeIoC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;f=false Grace, p. 2]. Attributed to unpublished typescript, no date&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting has been widely reproduced, seen across Canada in schools and public institutions. In 1967, a stamp featuring ''The Jack Pine'' was released to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the painting's creation and Thomson's death.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The pine depicted in the painting was located by park staff in 1970. The tree was already dead by the time of its discovery; it later fell over and was used for firewood by campers.&lt;ref&gt;"Algonquin Park site marks location where Tom Thomson sketched famous work", The Canadian Press. August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A lookout at Grand Lake now marks the site of the painting with a plaque that notes the significance of Thomson's work and depicts the painting alongside a photograph of the scene from the 1970s, before the tree fell.

'''''The Raft of the Medusa''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Radeau de la Méduse}} {{IPA-fr|lə ʁado d(ə) la medyz|}}) is an [[oil painting]] of 1818–19 by the French [[Romantic movement|Romantic]] painter and [[lithography|lithographer]] [[Théodore Géricault]] (1791–1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491&amp;nbsp;cm × 716&amp;nbsp;cm (16' 1" × 23' 6"),&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Klaus. ''Géricault and His Work''. Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1955. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval [[French frigate Méduse (1810)|frigate ''Méduse'']], which ran aground off the coast of today's [[Mauritania]] on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13&amp;nbsp;days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practised cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.

Géricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest.&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;"[https://archive.is/20121209133033/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226914&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&amp;bmLocale=en The Raft of the Medusa]". [[Louvre]]. Retrieved on 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting.

Although ''The Raft of the Medusa'' retains elements of the traditions of [[history painting]], in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The [[Louvre]] acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], and [[Édouard Manet]].

[[File:Raft of Méduse-Alexandre Corréard-IMG 4788-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|Plan of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' at the moment of its crew's rescue&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo. ''Extremities: Painting Empire in Post-Revolutionary France''. [[Yale University Press]], 2002. 177. {{ISBN|0-300-08887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In June 1816, the French [[frigate]] ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' departed from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], bound for the [[Senegal]]ese port of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the [[Combat stores ship|storeship]] ''Loire'', the [[brig]] [[HMS Plumper (1804)|''Argus'']] and the [[corvette]] ''Écho''. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed [[Ranks in the French Navy|captain]] of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Zarzeczny, Matthew. "Theodore Géricault's 'The Raft of the Méduse' Part I". ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'', Fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zarzeczny, Matthew. "Theodore Géricault's 'The Raft of the Méduse' Part II". ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'', Spring 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;For Louis XVIII's real political actions and appointments, see P. Mansel, ''Louis XVIII'' (London, 1981), and for the general political climate of the period, see Munro Price, ''The Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions'' (London, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Peace of Paris]]. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel [[Julien-Désiré Schmaltz]], and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Jore, Léonce (1953) "[http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0399-1385_1953_num_40_139_1188 La vie diverse et volontaire du colonel Julien, Désiré Schmaltz]". ''Revue d'histoire des colonies''. Vol. 40, No. 139, pp. 265–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to make good time, the ''Méduse'' overtook the other ships, but due to poor navigation it drifted {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} off course. On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today's [[Mauritania]]. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumereys, a returned [[émigré]] who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment.&lt;ref name="Darcy"&gt;Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.

Although the ''Méduse'' was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship's complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Lavauzelle|page=30|title=Les Troupes de Marine 1622-1984|ISBN=2-7025-0142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; - at least 146 men and one woman - were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded ''Méduse''. The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose.&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 2:19&lt;/ref&gt; For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship's biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny &amp; Corréard, 59–60, 76, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors "to the frontiers of human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest."&lt;ref name="Darcy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Jonathan.

Of the 17 men that remained behind on the ''Méduse'' only 3 were still alive when rescued by the British 42 days later.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''The Raft of the Medusa'' portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when "the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete".&lt;ref name="Christine" /&gt; The painting is on a monumental scale of 491 × 716&amp;nbsp;cm (193.3 × 282.3&amp;nbsp;in), so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized&lt;ref name="Boime142"&gt;Boime, 142&lt;/ref&gt; and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.&lt;ref name=banham/&gt;

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,&lt;ref&gt;Hagen &amp; Hagen, 378&lt;/ref&gt; stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Muther, 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.

[[File:Radeau meduse structure.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the outline of the two pyramidal structures that form the basis of the work. The position of the ''Argus'' is indicated by the yellow dot.]]
The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.&lt;ref name="Boime142" /&gt; According to the art historian Justin Wintle, "a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex."&lt;ref name="Wintle246"&gt;Wintle, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the ''Argus'', the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt;

Géricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds.&lt;ref name="Wilkin" /&gt; Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"&gt;Miles, 180&lt;/ref&gt; The work's lighting has been described as "[[Caravaggio|Caravaggesque]]",&lt;ref name="Nov85" /&gt; after the Italian artist closely associated with [[tenebrism]]—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures.&lt;ref name="M226"&gt;Muther, 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.&lt;ref name="M226"/&gt;

=== Research and preparatory studies ===

[[File:Medusa study 1.jpg|thumb|Géricault's ''Study for "The Raft of the Medusa"'', pen and brown ink, 17.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 24.5&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Musee des Beaux-Arts]], [[Lille]], France]]
Géricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter.&lt;ref name="M169"&gt;Miles, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and [[Alexandre Corréard]], an engineer from the [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers]]. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting.&lt;ref name="Christine"&gt;Riding (February 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 11:38&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier travels had exposed Géricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the ''Méduse'' his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the [[Rigor mortis|stiffness]] of corpses.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt; To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead,&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt; he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon,&lt;ref name="M169" /&gt; studied the faces of dying hospital patients,&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay,&lt;ref name="M169"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[:File:Anatomical Pieces.JPG|Anatomical Pieces]]'', an unusual still-life which Géricault produced in 1818–1819, shows some of these dismembered limbs.&lt;/ref&gt; and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

He worked with Corréard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to [[Le Havre]] to study the sea and sky.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 9:04&lt;/ref&gt;

He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work.&lt;ref name="Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376"&gt;Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.

Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue.&lt;ref name="R77"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship ''Argus''—visible in the upper right of the painting—which they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, "From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief."&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;

To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew's abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;—the ''Argus'' reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, Lorenz.

The author [[Rupert Christiansen]] points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

=== Final work ===
Géricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

He used friends as models, most notably the painter [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast;&lt;ref name="Hagen &amp; Hagen, 376"/&gt; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, "Géricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room."&lt;ref name="Wellingtonxi"&gt;Wellington, xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Géricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of [[vermilion]], white, [[naples yellow]], two different [[red ochre|yellow ochres]], two [[red ochre]]s, [[sienna|raw sienna]], [[light red]], [[burnt sienna]], [[crimson lake]], [[Prussian blue]], [[peach black]], [[Bone char|ivory black]], cassel earth and [[bitumen]].&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated.&lt;ref name=gayford/&gt; As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.&lt;ref name=banham&gt;Banham, Joanna.

Géricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a "shocking physicality"&lt;ref name="Wintle246" /&gt; and a sense of deliberate theatricality—which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30&amp;nbsp;years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:

:[Géricault's method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months;&lt;ref name="Miles, 180"/&gt; the project as a whole took 18 months.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Raft of the Medusa'' fuses many influences from the [[Old Master]]s, from the ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]'' and [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] of [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'',&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Kenneth. ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form''. Princeton University Press, 1990. 269. {{ISBN|0-691-01788-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the monumental approach of [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1748–1825) and [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1771–1835), to contemporary events.  By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of [[marine art]], as well as an increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea. [[Claude Joseph Vernet]] (1714–1789) created many such images,&lt;ref&gt;Lacayo, Richard. [http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2007/01/08/more_fear_of_flying/ "More fear of flying"].

Géricault said, "Michelangelo sent shivers up my spine, these lost souls destroying each other inevitably conjure up the tragic grandeur of the Sistine Chapel."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 10:11&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13&amp;nbsp;days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, Géricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian [[Richard Muther (art historian)|Richard Muther]], there is still a strong debt to [[Classicism]] in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid "unpictorial" costumes. Muther observes that there is "still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death".&lt;ref name="M226" /&gt;

The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant "fruitful moment"—the first awareness of the approaching ship—is described.&lt;ref name="Nov85"&gt;Novotny, 85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, David also painted an important current event with ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the [[French Revolution|revolution in France]], and it served as an important precedent for Géricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented "the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause",&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Blaney; in Noon, 49&lt;/ref&gt; but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures.&lt;ref name="R77" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[:File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau]]'' (1807) and ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804)&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa]]'', by Gros.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt;

The darkness and the sprawling naked figure was an influence on Géricault's painting.&lt;ref name=gayford/&gt;]]

The young Géricault had painted copies of work by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] (1758–1823), whose "thunderously tragic pictures" include his masterpiece, ''Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime'', where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced Géricault's painting.&lt;ref name=gayford&gt;Gayford, Martin.

The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to [[Ugolino and Dante|Ugolino]] from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of [[cannibalism]], which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli.&lt;ref name="R73"&gt;Noon, 84. Riding (June 2003), 73.

Musée du Louvre département des Arts graphiques, RF 53032, recto. [[Joconde]] # 50350513324&lt;/ref&gt;

Several English and American paintings including ''[[The Death of Major Pierson]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley]] (1738–1815)—also painted within two years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like ''The Raft of the Medusa'', concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782]]'' (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and ''[[:File:SceneofaShipwreck-Copley.png|Scene of a Shipwreck]]'' (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition.&lt;ref name="R77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;Nicholson, Benedict. "The Raft of the Medusa from the Point of View of the Subject-Matter". ''Burlington Magazine'', XCVI, August 1954. 241—8&lt;/ref&gt; A further important precedent for the political component was the works of [[Francisco Goya]], particularly his ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply ''Shipwreck'' (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with ''The Raft of the Medusa''. It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

== Exhibition and reception ==

''The Raft of the Medusa'' was first shown at the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], under the title ''Scène de Naufrage'' (''Shipwreck Scene''), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers.&lt;ref name=christiansen&gt;Christiansen, Rupert.

Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? [[Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie]], a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic [[Auguste Jal]], who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its [[modernity]]. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] approved: "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt;

Géricault had deliberately sought to be both politically and artistically confrontational. Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer's sympathies favoured the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and [[Alexandre Corréard|Corréard]].&lt;ref name="Christine" /&gt; The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of Géricault's [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting's later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there.&lt;ref&gt;Riding (June 2003), 71&lt;/ref&gt; According to art critic and curator [[Karen Wilkin]], Géricault's painting acts as a "cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France's post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''".&lt;ref name="Wilkin"&gt;[[Karen Wilkin|Wilkin, Karen]].

[[File:Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly 1815 edited.jpg|thumb|In 1820, Géricault successfully exhibited the painting in the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[Piccadilly]], London.]]

The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the [[Sacred Heart|Sacred Heart of Jesus]], which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own.&lt;ref name=christiansen/&gt; Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Géricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]]'s [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[Piccadilly]], London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="R72"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in [[French art]].

There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including "a degree of national self-congratulation",&lt;ref name="Riding2"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 68–73&lt;/ref&gt; the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment,&lt;ref name="Riding2" /&gt; and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from Géricault's depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Riding, Christine.

''The Raft of the Medusa'' was championed by the curator of the Louvre, [[Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste de Forbin|comte de Forbin]] who purchased it for the museum from Géricault's heirs after his death in 1824. The painting now dominates its gallery there.&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt; The display caption tells us that "the only hero in this poignant story is humanity".&lt;ref name="Louvre" /&gt;

At some time between 1826 and 1830 American artist [[George Cooke (painter)|George Cooke]] (1793–1849) made a copy of the painting in a smaller size, (130.5 x 196.2&amp;nbsp;cm; approximately 4&amp;nbsp;ft × 6&amp;nbsp;ft), which was shown in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. to crowds who knew about the controversy surrounding the shipwreck. Reviews favoured the painting, which also stimulated plays, poems, performances and a children's book.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, Nina &amp; De Filippis, Marybeth.

Because of deterioration in the condition of Géricault's original, the Louvre in 1859–60 commissioned two French artists, Pierre-Désiré Guillemet and Étienne-Antoine-Eugène Ronjat, to make a full size copy of the original for loan exhibitions.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, Roberta.

In the autumn of 1939, the ''Medusa'' was packed for removal from the Louvre in anticipation of the outbreak of war.  A scenery truck from the [[Comédie-Française]] transported the painting to Versailles in the night of 3 September.  Some time later, the ''Medusa'' was moved to the [[Château de Chambord]] where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn H.

[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' 1787, 129.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 196.2&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. David represented the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style, from which Géricault sought to break.]]

In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was a landmark in the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting, and "laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution"&lt;ref name="N14"&gt;Néret, 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; against the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style.  Géricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular [[history painting]] genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/david/ Jacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile]". [[Getty Museum]]. Retrieved 31 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], [[François Gérard]], [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]—teacher of both Géricault and Delacroix—and other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and [[Nicolas Poussin]].

[[File:Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau cropped.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Antoine-Jean Gros]], detail from ''Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau'', 1807, Louvre. Like Gros, Géricault had seen and felt the exhilaration of violence, and was distraught by the human consequences.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt;]]

In his introduction to ''The Journal of Eugène Delacroix'', Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, "The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. Gérard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire—some of them admirable—fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Wellingtonxi" /&gt;

''The Raft of the Medusa'' contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama.&lt;ref name="Boime141"&gt;Boime, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Géricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, "the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism".&lt;ref name="Christine"/&gt;

The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications of the extent to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.&lt;ref name="Wilkin"/&gt;

Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, "Géricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it."&lt;ref name=Wellingtonxi/&gt; The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as ''The Shipwreck of Don Juan'' (1840).&lt;ref name="N14" /&gt;

[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'', 1822. ''The Raft of the Medusa'''s influence on the work of the young Delacroix was immediately apparent in this painting, as well as in later works.&lt;ref name="N14" /&gt;]]

According to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', springs directly from Géricault's ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's own ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]''. Wellington wrote that "While Géricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, xv&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's  ''Massacre at Chios'' provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s monumental sculpture ''[[The Gates of Hell]]''. He wrote that "Delacroix's ''Massacre at Chios'' and Géricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies&amp;nbsp;... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'', he had Géricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' in front of him for encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eugène Delacroix, ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]'', 1824, 419&amp;nbsp;cm × 354&amp;nbsp;cm, Louvre. This painting springs directly from Géricault's ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and was painted in 1824, the year Géricault died.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, 19–49&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like ''A Burial at Ornans'' (1849–50) and ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' (1855) owe a debt to ''The Raft of the Medusa''. The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events,&lt;ref&gt;
Clark, T.J. ''Farewell to an Idea''. Yale University Press, 2001. 21. {{ISBN|0-300-08910-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the [[Clark Art Institute]],  ''Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier'', sought to compare the 19th-century [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] painters Courbet, [[Honoré Daumier]] (1808–1879), and early [[Édouard Manet]] (1832–1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including Géricault and Delacroix. Citing ''The Raft of the Medusa'' as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano, Charles. "[http://www.maverick-arts.com/cgi-bin/MAVERICK?action=article&amp;issue=148 Courbet at the Clark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060446/http://www.maverick-arts.com/cgi-bin/MAVERICK?action=article&amp;issue=148 |date=30 September 2011 }}". ''Maverick Arts Magazine''. Retrieved 29 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Michael Fried]] sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of ''Angels at the Tomb of Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was felt by artists beyond France. [[Francis Danby]], a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by Géricault's picture when he painted ''Sunset at Sea after a Storm'' in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' was "the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;Noon, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - A Disaster at Sea - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W.

Turner probably saw Géricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820.]] The subject of marine tragedy was undertaken by [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1775–1851), who, like many English artists, probably saw Géricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820.&lt;ref name="r89"&gt;Riding (June 2003), 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artsmia.org/crossing-the-channel/historical.html Crossing the Channel]". Minneapolis Institute of the Arts, 2003. Retrieved on 1 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''A Disaster at Sea'' (c. 1835) chronicled a similar incident, this time a British catastrophe, with a swamped vessel and dying figures also placed in the foreground. Placing a coloured figure in the centre of the drama was revisited by Turner, with similar [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] overtones, in his ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840).&lt;ref name="r89" /&gt; 
[[File:Winslow Homer - The Gulf Stream - Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Winslow Homer]], ''The Gulf Stream'', 1899, 71.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 124.8&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
''[[The Gulf Stream (painting)|The Gulf Stream]]'' (1899), by the American artist [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), replicates the composition of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the ''Argus'' from Géricault's painting.&lt;ref name="Dorment"&gt;Dorment, Richard. "Painting the Unpaintable". ''The New York Review of Books''. 27 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer's figure.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Randall C. ''Homer, Eakins &amp; Anshutz: The Search for American Identity in the Gilded Age''. Penn State Press, 2004. 102. {{ISBN|0-271-02329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to "sullen rage".&lt;ref name="Dorment" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, sculptor [[John Connell]], in his ''Raft Project'', a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated ''The Raft of the Medusa'' by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.&lt;ref&gt;ARTnews, Summer 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that Géricault's painting represents, "on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life."&lt;ref&gt;Borias, 12:32&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Kenneth Clark]], ''The Raft of the Medusa'' "remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove Géricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Today, a bronze [[Relief|bas-relief]] of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' by [[Antoine Étex]] adorns Géricault's grave in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 249&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tracing paper''' is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} it then found many other uses. The original use for drawing and tracing was largely superseded by technologies which do not require diazo copying or manual copying (by tracing) of drawings.

The transparency of the paper is achieved by careful selection of the raw materials and the process used to create transparency. [[Cellulose fiber|Cellulose fibre]] forms the basis of the paper, usually from wood species but also from cotton fibre. Often, paper contains other filler materials to enhance opacity and print quality. For tracing or translucent paper, it is necessary to remove any material which obstructs the transmission of light.&lt;ref name="A1020"&gt;[http://www.paperonweb.com/A1020.htm How is paper made translucent (grease proof, tracing paper)?] PaperOnWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracing paper is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It is named as such for its ability for an [[image]] to be [[Copying|traced]] onto it. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When tracing paper is placed onto a [[picture]], the picture is easily visible through the paper. Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the tracing paper. Pure [[cellulose]] [[fiber]] is [[translucent]], and it is the [[air]] trapped between fibers that makes paper [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and look white.&lt;ref name="A1020" /&gt; If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting [[Paper|sheet]] will be translucent. Translucent papers are [[Density|dense]] and contain up to 10% [[moisture]] at 50% [[humidity]].

== Production ==

Tracing paper is usually made from [[Sulfite process|sulfite]] [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] by reducing the [[fibre]]s to a state of fine [[subdivision (paper)|subdivision]] and [[Hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] them by very prolonged beating in water.

There are three main processes to manufacture this type of paper, as follows:-

# Through mechanical ‘refining’ of the cellulose fibre to create a fibre which is highly fibrillated and gelatinous, so that in forming the sheet of paper, virtually all air is excluded from the internal structure of the paper. This method produces a very translucent and even looking paper over a range of grammages from 42 to over 280 gsm.
# By making a ‘normal’ sheet of paper and then filling the spaces between the fibres with a material that has the same refractive index as the cellulose. This was a common process adopted in the USA. The product was frequently called Vellum, although this terminology can refer to a wider range of special papers. Due to the relatively high cost, this method of manufacture has largely disappeared.
# As with 2, by making a normal sheet of paper, which is followed by immersing uncut and unloaded paper of good [[Quality (business)|quality]] in [[sulfuric acid]] for a few [[second]]s. The [[acid]] converts some of the [[cellulose]] into [[amyloid]] form having a [[gelatinous]] and impermeable character. When the treated paper is thoroughly washed and dried, the resultant [[Product (business)|product]] is much [[Tensile strength|stronger]] than the original paper. Tracing paper is resistant to [[oil]], [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] and to a large extent impervious to [[water]] and [[gas]].

The [[sizing]] in production will determine whether it is for [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet]]/[[offset printing]].

Tracing paper may be uncoated or coated.{{explain|reason=With what is it coated?|date=December 2017}} Natural tracing paper for laser printing is usually uncoated.

The [[Harmonized System|HS]] code for tracing paper is 4806.30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs_nomenclature_older_edition/~/media/18FE685D7E8E429996FC0F92A5DDB1C2.ashx|title=Paper and paperboard; articles of paper pulp, of paper or of paperboard|website=wcoomd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracing paper can be recycled and also can be made from up to 30% recycled fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com/faqs |title= Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} Arjoqiggins Creative Papers |work= arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|350px|A trailer for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'']]

A '''trailer''' (also known as a '''preview''' or '''coming attraction''') is a commercial [[advertisement]] for a [[feature film]] that will be exhibited in the future at a [[movie theater|cinema]], the result of creative and technical work. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://straightdope.com/mailbag/mtrailers.html | title = Why are they called "trailers" if they're shown before the movie? | author = Gfactor | publisher = The Straight Dope | date = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.

Movie trailers have now become popular on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]] discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]).]]

The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''The Pleasure Seekers'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ''Daily Star'', the practice which Loew adopted was described as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising".&lt;ref&gt;"Movies Score on Legit in New York;" Lincoln, Nebraska ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers were initially shown after, or "trailing", the feature film, and this led to their being called "trailers". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]).  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]) by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. [[Pablo Ferro]], who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most [[VHS]] tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to "Stay tuned after the feature for more previews." With [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]s, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trailer music |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group ''[[National Association of Theatre Owners]]'' issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/theaters-advocate-shorter-trailers-marketing/ | title = Theaters Advocate Shorter Movie Trailers | publisher = MarketingMovies.net | date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] in a 1937 color film trailer for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.]]

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when [[Janet Leigh]] was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]]. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Truth vs. misleading ==
{{essay|section|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by [[bait and switch]]ing, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernman.com/10-incredibly-misleading-movie-trailers/ |title=10 Movie Trailers That Are Nothing Like The Actual Movie |publisher=Modernman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American woman sued the makers of ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' because their film "failed to live up to its promo's promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Giles|title=Misleading trailer leads to law suit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/misleading-trailer-leads-to-law-suit-20111011-1lj2z.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Woman sues to stop Drive getting away with a 'misleading' trailer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/08/11 3:02pm 10/08/11 3:02pm |url=http://gawker.com/5847970/woman-files-lawsuit-over-misleading-trailer-for-drive |title=Woman Files Lawsuit Over 'Misleading' Trailer for Drive |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although her lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2013/101513/55553.pdf ''Deming v.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (33).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from film trailer for 1959 ''[[North by Northwest]]'']]

[[Voice-over]] narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist [[Don LaFontaine]]. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliott]], John Leader, [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ashton Smith]], [[Jim Cummings]], John Garry, [[Tom Kane]], [[Nick Schatzki]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Tony Rodgers, [[Beau Weaver]], and [[Brian Cummings]]. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff,&lt;ref name="soundtrack.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/ |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers: Frequently Used Trailer Music |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]] and [[Beethoven]].  Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* "Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce [[trailer music]], some of the best known are [[audiomachine]], [[Two Steps From Hell]], [[Immediate Music]] and [[X-Ray Dog]] or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, [[Gerrit Kinkel Productions]] or [[RedCola Music|redCola]].
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020113.html?categoryid=4051&amp;cs=1 |title=Daily Variety: Razor-thin copyright line |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

A ''cast run'' is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, [[Paramount Pictures]] was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

Many trailers are [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixed]] in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution.  Since the advent of [[Digital 3D|Digital 3&amp;#8209;D]], it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cinemas also began to show "trailer trash" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as [[YouTube]] as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/03/sega-admits-aliens-colonial-marines-trailer-was-misleading/ |title=Sega Admits 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' Trailer Was Misleading |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-12-war-has-changed-but-has-hideo-kojima |title=War has changed.

=== TV spots ===
TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content "appropriate" for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===
[[TV show]] trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A '''book trailer''' is a [[video]] advertisement for a [[book]] which employs techniques similar to those of [[trailer (film)|movie trailers]] to promote books and encourage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=YouTube video sets stage for novel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/04/business/fi-vidbooks4|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trailers can also be referred to as "video-podcasts", with higher quality trailers being called "cinematic book trailers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deval|first=Jacqueline|title=Publicize Your Book (Updated): An Insider's Guide to Getting Your Book the Attention It Deserves|year=2008|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=0399534318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FVhmwgodMUC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=%22book+trailer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22book%20trailer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Justin|title=Seeking readers via 'book trailer' / Publisher tries out movie-style preview to market new title |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Seeking-readers-via-book-trailer-Publisher-2488096.php|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=On a screen near you ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features7|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kneschke|first=Tristan|title=Don't Judge a Book by its Trailer|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/301723/20120220/book-trailer-video-movie-edit-film-novel.htm|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=International Business Times|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=Super Sad Book Trailers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-06/features/ct-prj-0708-book-trailers-20120706_1_book-trailers-publishers-videos|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Farris|John Farris's]] book trailer for his 1986 novel ''Wildwood'' incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as [[John Zacherle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitton|first=Akira|title=TOR Books' WILDWOOD promo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OMCNVb7wMM|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the ''School Library Journal'' Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLJ's Trailie Awards Asks Readers to Vote for Their Favorite Book Trailer|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/886663-312/sljs_trailie_awards_asks_readers.html.csp|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookReels, an MTV for Books?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/62365-bookreels-an-mtv-for-books.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== MPAA rating cards for theatrical trailers ==
{{Anchor|Rating cards}}
[[File:Redband.JPG|thumb|An example of a red band trailer card, in this case for 2008 ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio{{clarify|date=February 2013}} is given one exception to this rule per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. ''Rating cards'' appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A ''green band'' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for "all audiences" and often included the movie's [[MPAA rating]]. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for "appropriate" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from "for appropriate audiences" to "to accompany this feature", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a ''red band'', which indicates approval for only "restricted" or "mature" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters{{clarify|date=December 2014}} rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cat-and-Mouse for a Trashy Trailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/movies/24kick.html | publisher =New York Times |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 | first=Brooks | last=Barnes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, "yellow band" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=13 June 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/movies/13yell.html |title=Attention, Web Surfers: The Following Film Trailer May Be Racy or Graphic |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E1 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and the [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Dolby Theater]] in Hollywood. ''The Film Informant'' also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 TFI Awards|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|work=2011 Film Informant Awards|publisher=The Film Informant|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717025506/http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Utamakura'''''|歌枕||extra="poem pillow"}} is a [[rhetoric]]al concept in [[Japanese poetry]].

==Definition==

''Utamakura'' is a category of poetic words, often involving place names, that allow for greater [[allusion]]s and [[intertextuality]] across Japanese poems.

''Utamakura'' includes locations familiar to the court of ancient Japan, such as
* particularly sacred [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sites,
* places where historic events occurred, and
* places that trigger a separate mental association through a pun.

==Aesthetic function==

''Utamakura'' serve as a significant tool to achieve yugen (mystery and depth) in Japanese poetry by adding profundity and indirect beauty in poems. It can be used as a source for identifying significant figures and places in ancient Japan. ''Utamakura'' enables poets to express ideas and themes concisely — thus allowing them to stay in the confines of strict waka structures.

Some scholars see the use of geographical allusion as the evidence for a restricted scope of poetry writing. Although the poets' "true" meaning was true because the essence was initially pre-established, the poems were written within fixed topics (''dai''). The poet could inhabit a subjective position or persona and write about the topic but not necessarily about his/her personal feelings. ''Utamakura'' could have suppressed poets' individuality or creativity.

==History==

The history of ''utamakura'' is found in documents on the study of poetry such as the ''Utamakura of [[Noin]]'', by the poet and monk of the late Heian period, and lists of places in the ''Utamakura Nayose'' (Utamakura reference book).

''Utamakura'' were first used by traveling priests.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} They collected stories from the towns they traveled to. Since they saw many places, it was easier to remember the details of a story by using a single, consistent reference point for each recurring event in their tales. Over time, the people across the Japan came to identify ''utamakura'' place names by the psychological feelings associated with the references made by the wandering priests.

After ''utamakura'' place names and people had become well established, eager waka poets went sightseeing to the sites of ''utamakura''. Beyond becoming familiar with the scenery of the poems, entering the locale of a poem or story deepened one's understanding of it.

''Utamakura'' was also used in ''[[renga]]'', a form of Japanese [[collaborative poetry]] that is the ancestor of ''[[renku]]'' and ''[[haiku]]'' poetry.

==Examples==

There are numerous instances of ''utamakura'' in Japanese literature, one of which is the ''[[Kokin Wakashū|Kokinshū]]''. The source of this particular ''utamakura'' example is poem #3 in the "Spring" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kokin Wakashū |chapter=Spring. No. 3|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-japanese?specfile=/web/data/japanese/search/japanese.o2w&amp;act=surround&amp;lang=en&amp;offset=44095026&amp;id=CookKok&amp;query=Where+are+the+promised |work=[[University of Virginia Japanese Text Initiative|Japanese Text Initiative]] |publisher=University of Virginia Library |year=2004 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem above, ''[[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]]'' refers to a place in the [[Yamato Province|Yamato region]] in the vicinity of the capital. ''Yoshino'' is known for having both heavy snowfall and an abundance of cherry blossoms.

Poem #1 in "Spring 1" of ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'' also uses ''Yoshino'' for depicting the beginning of spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shinkokinshu |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/japanese/shinkokinshu/index.html |work=[[University of Virginia Japanese Text Initiative|Japanese Text Initiative]] |publisher=University of Virginia Library |date=1 August 1999 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Steven D.|title=Traditional Japanese Poetry: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dq7TOrkTCP0C&amp;pg=PA510|year=1993|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2212-4|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of poetic place name comes from ''[[Tales of Ise]]'', a piece titled "In the Provinces" (#15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ise Monogatari |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/ise/index.html |work=Japanese Text Initiative |publisher=University of Virginia Library |date=11 November 1998 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=Helen Craig |title=Tales of Ise: Lyrical Episodes from Tenth - Century Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ol_MOUZmpMC|year=1968 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-0653-7 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mount Shinobu'' is a pun on the verb ''shinobu,'' meaning "to conceal," "endure," "long for," and "remember."

===Contemporary examples===

In Japan there are many examples of ''utamakura'' in everyday readings. Often, menu items will be named after their visual appearance with a reference to a well-known Japanese scenic area.

For example, the Tatsuta River is famous for its red autumn maples. Therefore, a menu that includes tatsuta age will have crispy fish or chicken that was marinated in soy sauce before it was dredged in cornstarch and deep fried. The cornstarch coating absorbs some of the soy, so that when it is fried it takes on a burnished, russet color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andoh|first=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Menu Names|url=http://www.bento.com/ta-name.html|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Daily Yomiuri|date=8 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels in other cultures==

''Utamakura'' can be described as "descriptive epithets" or "circumlocutions designating geographical sites" in poetry of other languages that conjure a memory, thought, image or association with the place referred to.

In [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' (Canto VII, line 106) there is a poetic place name in reference to the river [[Styx]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A lake is form'd, (the Stygian named of old)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By this sad stream, when downward it hath run
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Neath the grey rocks that hem the baleful hold.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The adjective Stygian means "of or relating to the River Styx". In [[Ancient Greek literature]], the River Styx forms the boundary between Earth and [[Hades]], the Underworld.

In contemporary Western cultures, parallels to the Japanese ''utamakura'' can be found in many popular songs. Musicians use place names in their lyrics to invoke certain conformed thoughts.

California is a common reference for artists in that it invokes thoughts of excess, splendor, wealth, and a sense of fakeness in body and spirit. [[Weezer]] references the excessiveness of Beverly Hills in their hit song "Beverly Hills", while the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] refer to the sense of things not being "real" in their song "Californication" by including lyrics about plastic surgery and the use of Hollywood sets in government conspiracy.
