      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15385">'''Action painting''', sometimes called "'''gestural abstraction'''", is a style of [[painting]] in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "[[abstract expressionism]]" interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[New York School (art)|The New York School]] of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20160410120628/http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his essay "The American Action Painters",&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn, 2008,  ''Art History'', 3:d edition, London, Pearson Education, p. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;  
and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the end result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Rosenberg created the term "action painting" in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slifkin|first=Robert|date=June 2011|title=The Tragic Image: Action Painting Refigured|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=64112998&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=34|pages=227–246|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. "Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like "informel" and "Action Painting," definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd." &amp;ndash; Clement Greenberg, "Post Painterly Abstraction".

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term "action" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist "acts" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]]; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual "action" with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from [[Happening]]s and [[Fluxus]] to [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]] and [[Earth Art]].

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Edwards|date=Spring 2008|title=What the Mind's Eye Sees: Action painters were postwar exemplars of American individualism|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=31308622&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=American Scholar|volume=77|pages=113–117|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the [[post-World War II]] artistic resurgence of [[expressionism]] in [[United States|America]] and more specifically [[New York City]], action painting developed in an era where [[quantum mechanics]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened [[self-consciousness]] and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The preceding art of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. ''Action painting'' took this a step further, using both [[Jung]] and [[Freud]]’s ideas of the [[subconscious]] as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung's studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] and tapping the collective sense of an [[archetype|archetypal]] visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the [[surrealist]] emphasis on [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the [[subconscious|subconscious mind]]. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters [[Joan Miró]] and [[André Masson]]. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

An '''art film''' is typically a serious, [[independent film]], aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Art film definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is "intended to be a serious, artistic work, often experimental and not designed for mass appeal",&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company: 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "made primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than commercial profit",&lt;ref&gt;Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary. Random House: 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and contains "unconventional or highly symbolic content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/art+film |title=Art film |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Film critic]]s and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an art film as possessing "formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films".&lt;ref name=Wilinsky&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Wilinsky |title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema |journal=[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]] |publisher=University of Minnesota |year=2001 |volume=32 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; These qualities can include (among other elements): a sense of [[social realism]]; an emphasis on the authorial expressiveness of the director; and a focus on the thoughts, dreams, or motivations of characters, as opposed to the unfolding of a clear, goal-driven story. Film scholar [[David Bordwell]] describes art cinema as "a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions".&lt;ref name="Barry 2007, p. 1"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Barry |title=Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2007 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art [[film producer]]s usually present their films at special theaters ([[repertory cinema]]s or, in the U.S., art-house cinemas) and at [[film festivals]]. The term ''art film'' is much more widely used in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia, compared to the rest of Europe, where the term is associated more with [[auteur theory|auteur films]] and [[national cinema]] (e.g. German national cinema). Since they are aimed at small, niche-market audiences, art films rarely acquire the financial backing that would permit large production budgets associated with [[wide release|widely released]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films. Art film directors make up for these constraints by creating a different type of film, one that typically uses lesser-known film actors (or even amateur actors), and modest sets to make films that focus much more on developing ideas, exploring new narrative techniques, and attempting new film-making conventions.

A certain degree of experience and knowledge is generally required to fully understand or appreciate such films. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called ''[[Chungking Express]]'', a critically acclaimed 1994 art film, "largely a cerebral experience" that one enjoys "because of what you know about film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/chungking-express-1996 |title=Chungking Express Movie Review (1996) |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=March 15, 1996 |accessdate=February 22, 2018 |via=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts sharply with mainstream blockbuster films, which are geared more towards [[escapism]] and pure entertainment. For promotion, art films rely on the publicity generated from film critics' reviews; discussion of the film by arts columnists, commentators, and [[blog]]gers; and word-of-mouth promotion by audience members. Since art films have small initial investment costs, they only need to appeal to a small portion of [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] audiences to become financially viable.

==History==
===Antecedents: 1910–1920s===
{{Multiple image|total_width=350

|image2=Intolerance (film).jpg|
|footer= Theatrical posters for ''[[L'Inferno]]'' and ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', often credited by cinema historians as the first art films.}}

The forerunners of art films include Italian silent film ''[[L'Inferno]]'' (1911), [[D. W. Griffith|D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) and the works of Russian filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], who influenced the development of European cinema movements for decades.&lt;ref name=Siska&gt;{{cite book |first=William C. |last=Siska |title=Modernism in the narrative cinema: the art film as a genre |publisher=Arno Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film study: an analytical bibliography |last=Manchel |first=Frank |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |isbn= |location= |page=118 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Italian Cinema |author=Peter Bondanella |year=2009 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=HgOl4LWswLQC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Divine+comedy,+first+art+film&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjor7u99ZfeAhVPTBoKHWv6CnkQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Divine%20comedy%2C%20first%20art%20film&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin|Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) was a revolutionary propaganda film he used to test his theories of using [[film editing]] to produce the greatest emotional response from an audience. The international critical renown that Eisenstein garnered from this film enabled him to direct ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' as part of a grand 10th anniversary celebration of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. He later directed ''[[The General Line]]'' in 1929.

Art films were also influenced by films by Spanish [[avant-garde]] creators, such as [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] (who made ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' in 1930), and by the French playwright and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]], whose 1930's avant-garde film ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' uses [[oneiric]] images throughout, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks. In the 1920s, film societies began advocating the notion that films could be divided into "entertainment cinema directed towards a mass audience and a serious art cinema aimed at an intellectual audience". In England, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Ivor Montagu]] formed a film society and imported films they thought were "artistic achievements", such as "Soviet films of dialectical montage, and the expressionist films of the Universum Film A.G. (UFA) studios in Germany".&lt;ref name=Siska/&gt;

''[[Cinéma pur]]'', a French avant-garde film movement in the 1920s and 1930s, also influenced the development of the idea of art film. The ''cinema pur'' film movement included several notable [[Dada]] artists. The Dadaists used film to transcend narrative storytelling conventions, bourgeois traditions, and conventional Aristotelian notions of time and space by creating a flexible montage of time and space.

[[File:Man Ray 1934.jpg|thumb|U.S. photographer and filmmaker [[Man Ray]] (pictured here in 1934) was part of the [[Dada]]ist ''"cinéma pur"'' film movement, which influenced the development of the art film.]]
The ''cinema pur'' movement was influenced by German "absolute" filmmakers such as [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Walter Ruttmann]] and [[Viking Eggeling]]. Richter falsely claimed that his 1921 film ''Rhythmus 21'' was the first [[abstract film]] ever created. In fact, he was preceded by the Italian [[Futurism (art)|Futurists]] [[Bruno Corra]] and [[Arnaldo Ginna]] between 1911 and 1912&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first1=F. T. |last1=Marinetti |first2=Bruno |last2=Corra |first3=Emilio |last3=Settimelli |first4=Arnaldo |last4=Ginna |first5=Giacomo |last5=Balla |first6=Remo |last6=Chiti |url=http://391.org/manifestos/1916-futurist-cinema-marinetti-corra-settimelli-ginna-balla-chiti.html |title=The Futurist Cinema Manifesto |date=15 November 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as reported in the ''Futurist Manifesto of Cinema''&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt;), as well as by fellow German artist Walter Ruttmann, who produced ''Lichtspiel Opus 1'' in 1920. Nevertheless, Richter's film ''Rhythmus 21'' is considered an important early abstract film.

===1930s–1950s===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood films could be divided into the artistic aspirations of literary adaptations like [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]'' (1935) and [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'' (1940), and the money-making "popular-genre films" such as gangster thrillers. William Siska argues that Italian [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] films from the mid-to-late 1940s, such as ''[[Rome, Open City|Open City]]'' (1945), ''[[Paisà|Paisa]]'' (1946), and ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' can be deemed as another "conscious art film movement".&lt;ref name=Siska/&gt;

In the late 1940s, the U.S. public's perception that Italian neorealist films and other serious European fare were different from mainstream Hollywood films was reinforced by the development of "arthouse cinemas" in major U.S. cities and college towns. After the Second World War, "...a growing segment of the American film going public was wearying of mainstream Hollywood films", and they went to the newly created art-film theaters to see "alternatives to the films playing in main-street movie palaces".&lt;ref name=Wilinsky/&gt; Films shown in these art cinemas included "British, foreign-language, and independent American films, as well as documentaries and revivals of Hollywood classics". Films such as Rossellini's ''Open City'' and Mackendrick's ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Tight Little Island]]'' (''Whisky Galore!''), ''Bicycle Thieves'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' were shown to substantial U.S. audiences.&lt;ref name=Wilinsky/&gt;

In the late 1950s, [[Cinema of France|French filmmakers]] began to produce films that were influenced by [[Italian Neorealism]]&lt;ref name="Marie, Michel 2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marie|last=Michel|title=''The French New Wave : An Artistic School''|translator=Richard Neupert|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[classical Hollywood cinema]],&lt;ref name="Marie, Michel 2002"/&gt; a style that critics called the [[French New Wave]]. Although never a formally organized movement, New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful [[iconoclasm]], and their films are an example of [[European art cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brynmawrfilm.org/08_French_Cinema_NEW.html |title=French Cinema: Making Waves |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511201931/http://www.brynmawrfilm.org/08_French_Cinema_NEW.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. Some of the most prominent pioneers among the group, including [[François Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]], and [[Jacques Rivette]], began as critics for the film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''. Auteur theory holds that the [[film director|director]] is the "author" of his films, with a personal signature visible from film to film.

===1960s–1970s===
[[File:Vilgotkultur 196220a.jpg|thumb|right|Actress [[Lena Nyman]] from the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'']]
The French New Wave movement continued into the 1960s. During the 1960s, the term "art film" began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly to include foreign-language (non-English)  ''"auteur"'' films, [[independent film]]s, [[experimental film]]s, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s, "art film" became a [[euphemism]] in the U.S. for racy Italian and French [[B-movies]]. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe [[pornography|sexually explicit]] European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]''. In the U.S., the term "art film" may refer to films by modern American artists, including [[Andy Warhol]] with his 1969 film ''[[Blue Movie]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie. D1. Print. (behind paywall) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/10/archives/warhols-red-hot-and-blue-movie-warhols-red-hot-and-blue-movie.html |date=August 10, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes used very loosely to refer to the broad range of films shown in repertory theaters or "art house cinemas". With this approach, a broad range of films, such as a 1960s [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] film, a 1970s experimental underground film, a European auteur film, a U.S. "independent" film, and even a mainstream foreign-language film (with subtitles) might all fall under the rubric of "art house films".

===1980s–2000s===
By the 1980s and 1990s, the term "art film" became conflated with "independent film" in the U.S., which shares many of the same stylistic traits. Companies such as [[Miramax Films]] distributed [[independent films]] that were deemed commercially viable. When major motion-picture studios noted the niche appeal of independent films, they created special divisions dedicated to non-mainstream fare, such as the [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] division of [[Twentieth Century Fox]], the [[Focus Features]] division of [[Universal Studios|Universal]], the [[Sony Pictures Classics]] division of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], and the [[Paramount Vantage]] division of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. Film critics have debated whether films from these divisions can be considered "independent films", given they have financial backing from major studios.

In 2007, Professor [[Camille Paglia]] argued in her article "Art movies: R.I.P." that "[a]side from [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series, with its deft flashbacks and gritty social realism, ...[there is not]... a single film produced over the past 35 years that is arguably of equal philosophical weight or virtuosity of execution to [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' or ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]''". Paglia states that young people from the 2000s do not "have patience for the long, slow take that deep-think European directors once specialized in", an approach which gave "luxurious scrutiny of the tiniest facial expressions or the chilly sweep of a sterile room or bleak landscape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Camille|last=Paglia|url=https://www.salon.com/2007/08/08/clarkson|title=Art movies: R.I.P. |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |date=August 8, 2007|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to director, producer, and distributor [[Roger Corman]], the "1950s and 1960s was the time of the art film's greatest influence. After that, the influence waned. Hollywood absorbed the lessons of the European films and incorporated those lessons into their films." Corman states that "viewers could see something of the essence of the European art cinema in the Hollywood movies of the seventies... [and so], art film, which was never just a matter of European cinema, increasingly became an actual world cinema—albeit one that struggled to gain wide recognition". Corman notes that, "Hollywood itself has expanded, radically, its aesthetic range... because the range of subjects at hand has expanded to include the very conditions of image-making, of movie production, of the new and prismatic media-mediated experience of modernity. There's a new audience that has learned about art films at the video store." Corman states that "there is currently the possibility of a rebirth" of American art film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Brody|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2013/01/the-state-of-the-art-film.html#ixzz2PhbsvhWT|title=The State of the "Art Film"|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deviations from mainstream film norms==
Film scholar David Bordwell outlined the academic definition of "art film" in a 1979 article entitled "The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice", which contrasts art films with the mainstream films of classical Hollywood cinema. Mainstream Hollywood-style films use a clear [[narrative]] form to organize the film into a series of "causally related events taking place in space and time", with every scene driving towards a goal. The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of mainstream films is driven by a well-defined protagonist, fleshed out with clear characters, and strengthened with "question-and-answer logic, problem-solving routines, [and] deadline plot structures". The film is then tied together with fast pacing, a musical soundtrack to cue the appropriate audience emotions, and tight, seamless [[editing]].&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Bordwell|url=http://www.film.ubc.ca/ubcinephile/cinephile/steenberg-framingwar.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113113059/http://www.film.ubc.ca/ubcinephile/cinephile/steenberg-framingwar.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-11-13|title=The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice|publisher=''Film Criticism''|volume=4|number=1|date=Fall 1979|accessdate=November 13, 2008|via=The Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Bordwell states that "the art cinema motivates its narrative by two principles: [[social realism|realism]] and authorial expressiveness". Art films deviate from the mainstream "classical" norms of film making in that they typically deal with more episodic narrative structures with a "loosening of the chain of cause and effect".&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com" /&gt;

Mainstream films also deal with moral dilemmas or identity crises, but these issues are usually resolved by the end of the film. In art films, the dilemmas are probed and investigated in a pensive fashion, but usually without a clear resolution at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Elsaesser|url=http://www.bergmanorama.com/sightsound94_elsaesser.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729074406/http://www.bergmanorama.com/sightsound94_elsaesser.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 July 2007|title=Putting on a Show: The European Art Movie|publisher=''Bergmanorama: The Magic Works of Ingmar Bergman''|date=29 July 2007|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story in an art film often has a secondary role to character development and an exploration of ideas through lengthy sequences of dialogue. If an art film has a story, it is usually a drifting sequence of vaguely defined or ambiguous episodes. There may be unexplained gaps in the film, deliberately unclear sequences, or extraneous sequences that are not related to previous scenes, which force the viewer to subjectively make their own interpretation of the film's message. Art films often "bear the marks of a distinctive visual style" and the [[auteur theory|authorial]] approach of the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu-london.co.uk/FT316reading6-SocialCinema.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705151224/http://www.bu-london.co.uk/FT316reading6-SocialCinema.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 5, 2007|title=The Social Art Cinema: A Moment of History in the History of British Film and Television Culture|last=Williams|first=Christopher|date=July 5, 2007|website=|publisher=''Cinema: The Beginnings and the Future''|accessdate=February 22, 2017|via=The Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; An art cinema film often refuses to provide a "readily answered conclusion", instead putting to the cinema viewer the task of thinking about "how is the story being told? Why tell the story in this way?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Allison|last=Arnold Helminski|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/2/memories.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010721095233/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/2/memories.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 21, 2001|title=''Memories'' of a Revolutionary Cinema|publisher=Senses of Cinema|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordwell claims that "art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions".&lt;ref name="Barry 2007, p. 1" /&gt; Film theorist [[Robert Stam]] also argues that "art film" is a film genre. He claims that a film is considered to be an art film based on artistic status in the same way film genres can be based on aspects of films such as their budgets ([[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films or [[B-movies]]) or their star performers ([[Adam Sandler]] films).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Stam|first2=Toby|last2=Miller|title=''Film and Theory: An Introduction''|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Film and Film Criticism==
There are scholars who point out that mass market films such as those produced in Hollywood appeal to a less discerning audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exhibition, the Film Reader|last=Hark|first=Ina Rae|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0-415-23517-0|location=London|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group then turns to film critics as a cultural elite that can help steer them towards films that are more thoughtful and of a higher quality. To bridge the disconnect between popular taste and high culture, these film critics are expected to explain unfamiliar concepts and make them appealing to cultivate a more discerning movie-going public. For example, a film critic can help the audience—through his reviews—think seriously about films by providing the terms of analysis of these art films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema|last=Wilinsky|first=Barbara|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8166-3562-5|location=Minneapolis|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an artistic framework of film analysis and review, these film critics provide viewers with a different way to appreciate what they are watching. So when controversial themes such as lesbianism or torture are shown, the public will not immediately dismiss or attack the movie where they are informed by critics of the film's value such as how it depicts realism. Here, art theaters or art houses that exhibit art films are seen as "sites of cultural enlightenment" that draw critics and intellectual audiences alike. It serves as a place where these critics can experience culture and an artistic atmosphere where they can draw insights and material.

==Timeline of notable films==
The following list is a small, partial sample of films with "art film" qualities, compiled to give a general sense of what directors and films are considered to have "art film" characteristics. The films in this list demonstrate one or more of the characteristics of art films: a serious, non-commercial, or independently made film that is not aimed at a mass audience. Some of the films on this list are also considered to be "auteur" films, independent films, or [[experimental film]]s. In some cases, critics disagree over whether a film is mainstream or not. For example, while some critics called [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991) an "exercise in film experimentation" of "high artistic quality",&lt;ref name="Allmovie.com"&gt;Allmovie.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it an ambitious mainstream film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Desson|last=Howe|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/myownprivateidahorhowe_a0b352.htm |title=My Own Private Idaho |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=October 18, 1991|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films on this list have most of these characteristics; other films are commercially made films, produced by mainstream studios, that nevertheless bear the hallmarks of a director's "auteur" style, or which have an experimental character. The films on this list are notable either because they won major awards or critical praise from influential film critics, or because they introduced an innovative narrative or film-making technique.

===1920s–1940s===
In the 1920s and 1930s, filmmakers did not set out to make "art films", and film critics did not use the term "art film". However, there were films that had sophisticated aesthetic objectives, such as [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' (1928) and ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932), surrealist films such as Luis Buñuel's ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929) and ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'' (1930), or even films dealing with political and current-event relevance such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s famed and influential masterpiece ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''. The U.S. film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' (1927) by [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] director [[F. W. Murnau]] uses distorted [[art design]] and groundbreaking cinematography to create an exaggerated, fairy-tale-like world rich with symbolism and imagery. [[Jean Renoir]]'s film ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' (1939) is a [[comedy of manners]] that transcends the conventions of the its genre by creating a biting and tragic satire of French upper-class society in the years before WWII; a poll of critics from ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' ranked it as the fourth greatest film ever, placing it behind ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html |title=Sight &amp; Sound &amp;#124; Top Ten Poll 2002 - Critics Top Ten 2002 |publisher=BFI |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2010-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216054527/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html |archivedate=2006-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) English Poster.png|thumb|The poster for Dreyer's ''The Passion of Joan of Arc'']]
Some of these early, artistically-oriented films were financed by wealthy individuals rather than film companies, particularly in cases where the content of the film was controversial or unlikely to attract an audience. In the late 1940s, UK director [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] made ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948), a film about ballet, which stood out from mainstream-genre films of the era. In 1945, [[David Lean]] directed ''[[Brief Encounter]]'', an adaptation of [[Noël Coward]]'s play ''[[Still Life]]'', which observes a passionate love affair between an upper-class man and a middle-class woman amidst the social and economic issues that Britain faced at the time.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, some of the well-known films with artistic sensibilities include ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), a film about a young woman who is forced to go to work for a cruel and inhumane circus performer in order to support her family, and eventually comes to terms with her situation; Carl Theodor Dreyer's ''[[Ordet]]'' (1955), centering on a family with a lack of faith, but with a son who believes that he is [[Jesus Christ]] and convinced that he is capable of performing miracles; [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' (1957), which deals with a prostitute's failed attempts to find love, her suffering and rejection; ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' (1957), by Ingmar Bergman, whose narrative concerns an elderly medical doctor, who is also a professor, whose nightmares lead him to re-evaluate his life; and ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959) by François Truffaut, whose main character is a young man trying to come of age despite abuse from his parents, schoolteachers, and society. In Poland, the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] permitted some relaxation of the regime's cultural policies, and productions such as ''[[A Generation]]'', ''[[Kanał|Kanal]]'', ''[[Ashes and Diamonds]]'', ''[[Lotna]]'' (1954–1959), all directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]], showed the [[Polish Film School]] style.

====Asia====
In [[India]], there was an art-film movement in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] known as "[[Parallel Cinema]]" or "Indian New Wave". This was an alternative to the mainstream commercial cinema known for its serious content, [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and naturalism, with a keen eye on the social-political climate of the times. This movement is distinct from mainstream [[Bollywood]] cinema and began around the same time as [[French New Wave|French]] and [[Japanese New Wave]]. The most influential filmmakers involved in this movement were [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]]. Some of the most internationally acclaimed films made in the period were ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959), a trio of films that tell the story of a poor country boy's growth to adulthood, and [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Ashani Sanket|Distant Thunder]]'' (1973), which tells the story of a farmer during a [[Bengal famine of 1943|famine in Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800EFD81639E73ABC4A52DFB6678388669EDE Movie Review - Ashani Sanket] By [[Vincent Canby]], ''The New York Times'', 12 October 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14025/Ashani-Sanket/overview Overview] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] filmmakers involved in this movement include [[Rituparno Ghosh]], [[Aparna Sen]] and [[Goutam Ghose]].

[[Cinema of Japan|Japanese filmmakers]] produced a number of films that broke with convention. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), the first Japanese film to be widely screened in the West, depicts four witnesses' contradictory accounts of a rape and murder. In 1952, Kurosawa directed ''[[Ikiru]]'', a film about a Tokyo bureaucrat struggling to find a meaning for his life. ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953), by [[Yasujirō Ozu]], explores social changes of the era by telling the story of an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children, but find the children are too self-absorbed to spend much time with them. ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), by Kurosawa, tells the story of a farming village that hires seven master-less samurais to combat bandits. ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires on the Plain]]'' (1959), by [[Kon Ichikawa]], explores the Japanese experience in World War II by depicting a sick Japanese soldier struggling to stay alive. ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953), by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], is a ghost story set in the late 16th century, which tells the story of peasants whose village is in the path of an advancing army. A year later, Mizoguchi directed ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954), which tells the story of two aristocratic children sold into slavery; in addition to dealing with serious themes such as the loss of freedom, the film features beautiful images and long, complicated shots.

===1960s===
The 1960s was an important period in art film, with the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the European art cinema. Jean-Luc Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle]]'' (''Breathless'') (1960) used innovative visual and editing techniques such as [[jump cut]]s and [[hand-held camera]] work. Godard, a leading figure of the French New Wave, would continue to make innovative films throughout the decade, proposing a whole new style of film-making. Following the success of ''Breathless'', Goddard made two more very influential films, ''[[Contempt]]'' and ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'', in 1963 and 1965 respectively. ''[[Jules et Jim]]'', by François Truffaut, deconstructed a complex relationship of three individuals through innovative screenwriting, editing, and camera techniques. Italian director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] helped revolutionize filmmaking with such films as ''[[La Notte]]'' (1961), a complex examination of a failed marriage that dealt with issues such as [[anomie]] and sterility; ''[[Eclipse (1962 film)|Eclipse]]'' (1962), about a young woman who is unable to form a solid relationship with her boyfriend because of his materialistic nature; ''[[Red Desert (film)|Red Desert]]'' (1964), his first color film, which deals with the need to adapt to the modern world; and ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966), his first English-language film, which examines issues of perception and reality as it follows a young photographer's attempt to discover whether he had photographed a murder.

[[Swedish cinema|Swedish director]] Ingmar Bergman began the 1960s with chamber pieces such as ''[[Winter Light]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'' (1963), which deal with such themes as emotional isolation and a lack of communication. His films from the second half of the decade, such as ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'' (1966), ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]'' (1969), deal with the idea of film as an artifice. The intellectual and visually expressive films of [[Tadeusz Konwicki]], such as ''[[All Souls' Day (film)|All Souls' Day]]'' (''Zaduszki'', 1961) and ''[[Salto (film)|Salto]]'' (1962), inspired discussions about war and raised existential questions on behalf of their everyman protagonists.

[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|Italian director [[Federico Fellini]]]]
Federico Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960) depicts a succession of nights and dawns in Rome as witnessed by a cynical journalist. In 1963, Fellini made ''[[8½]]'', an exploration of creative, marital and spiritual difficulties, filmed in black-and-white by cinematographer [[Gianni di Venanzo]]. The 1961 film ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' by director [[Alain Resnais]] examines perception and reality, using grand tracking shots that became widely influential. [[Robert Bresson]]'s ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]'' (1966) and ''[[Mouchette]]'' (1967) are notable for their naturalistic, elliptical style. Spanish director Luis Buñuel also contributed heavily to the art of film with shocking, surrealist satires such as ''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]'' (1962).

[[Russian film|Russian director]] [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966) is a portrait of the medieval Russian [[iconography|icon painter]] of the same name. The film is also about artistic freedom and the possibility and necessity of making art for, and in the face of, a repressive authority. A cut version of the film was shown at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2659/year/1969.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Andrei Rublev |accessdate=2009-04-10 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118070623/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2659/year/1969.html |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the decade, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) wowed audiences with its scientific realism, pioneering use of special effects, and unusual visual imagery. In 1969, Andy Warhol released ''Blue Movie'', the first adult art film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"/&gt; According to Warhol, ''Blue Movie'' was a major influence in the making of ''Last Tango in Paris'', an internationally controversial erotic art film, directed by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] and released a few years after ''Blue Movie'' was made.&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"/&gt; In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Armenia]], [[Sergei Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'', in which [[Georgian people|Georgian]] actress [[Sofiko Chiaureli]] plays five different characters, was banned by Soviet authorities, unavailable in the West for a long period, and praised by critic [[Mikhail Vartanov]] as "revolutionary";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parajanov.com/main.html |title=The Color of Pomegranates at Paradjanov.com |publisher=Parajanov.com |date=2001-01-09 |accessdate=2010-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914232615/http://www.parajanov.com/main.html |archivedate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early 1980s, ''[[Les Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' placed the film in its top 10 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parajanov.com/top100films.html |title=The Color of Pomegranates in Cahiers du Cinema Top 10 |publisher=Parajanov.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, in [[Georgia (country)|Soviet Georgia]], influential Georgian film director [[Tengiz Abuladze]] directed ''[[The Plea (film)|Vedreba]]'' (Entreaty), which was based on the motifs of [[Vaja-Pshavela]]'s literary works, where story is told in a poetic narrative style, full of symbolic scenes with philosophical meanings. In Iran, [[Dariush Mehrjui]]'s ''[[Gaav|The Cow]]'' (1969), about a man who becomes insane after the death of his beloved cow, sparked the new wave of [[Iranian cinema]].

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, directors shocked audiences with violent films such as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971), Stanley Kubrick's brutal exploration of futuristic youth gangs, and ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s taboo-breaking, sexually-explicit and controversial film. At the same time, other directors made more introspective films, such as [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s meditative science fiction film ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972), supposedly intended as a Soviet riposte to ''2001''. In 1975 and 1979 respectively, Tarkovsky directed two other films, which garnered critical acclaim overseas: ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''. [[Terrence Malick]], who directed ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973) and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' (1978) shared many traits with Tarkovsky, such as his long, lingering shots of natural beauty, evocative imagery, and poetic narrative style.

Another feature of 1970s art films was the return to prominence of bizarre characters and imagery, which abound in the tormented, obsessed title character in [[German New Wave]] director [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1973), and in [[cult film]]s such as [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s psychedelic ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' (1973) about a thief and an alchemist seeking the mythical [[Lotus Island]].&lt;ref&gt;This was Jodorowsky's second film from the 1970s. He also made ''[[El Topo]]'' (1970), a surrealistic western film.&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), by [[Martin Scorsese]], continues the themes that ''A Clockwork Orange'' explored: an alienated population living in a violent, decaying society. The gritty violence and seething rage of Scorsese's film contrasts other films released in the same period, such as [[David Lynch]]'s dreamlike, surreal ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). In 1974, [[John Cassavetes]] offered a sharp commentary on American blue-collar life in ''[[A Woman Under the Influence]]'', which features an eccentric housewife slowly descending into madness.

Also in the 1970s, [[Radley Metzger]] directed several [[adult art film]]s, such as ''[[Barbara Broadcast]]'' (1977), which presented a [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] "Buñellian" atmosphere,&lt;ref name="MD-20130827"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Barbara Broadcast – BluRay DVD Review |url=http://www.mondo-digital.com/barbarabroadcast.html |date=August 27, 2013 |work=Mondo-digital.com |accessdate=February 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'' (1976), based on the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]] (and its derivative, ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''), which was considered, according to award-winning author [[Toni Bentley]], to be the "crown jewel" of the [[Golden Age of Porn]],&lt;ref name="PB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |date=June 2014 |work=[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]] |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030128/http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |archive-date=February 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.tonibentley.com/pdfarticles/playboy/RadleyMetzger_AuteuroftheErotic_ToniBentley.pdf |format=PDF |date=June 2014 |work=ToniBentley.com |accessdate=January 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an era in modern American culture that was inaugurated by the release of Andy Warhol's ''Blue Movie'' (1969) and featured the phenomenon of "[[porno chic]]"&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |date=January 21, 1973 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jahsonic.com/PornoChic.html|title=Porno Chic|website=www.jahsonic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Pornography|adult erotic]] films began to obtain wide release, were publicly discussed by celebrities (such as [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Bob Hope]])&lt;ref name="TM-20050329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |date=March 29, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taken seriously by film critics (such as [[Roger Ebert]]).&lt;ref name="RE-19730613"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Devil In Miss Jones - Film Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devil-in-miss-jones-1973 |date=June 13, 1973 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RE-19761124"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Alice in Wonderland:An X-Rated Musical Fantasy |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alice-in-wonderland-1976 |date=November 24, 1976 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1980, director [[Martin Scorsese]] shocked audiences, who had become used to the escapist blockbuster adventures of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]], with the gritty, harsh realism of his film ''[[Raging Bull]]''. In this film, actor [[Robert De Niro]] took [[method acting]] to an extreme to portray a boxer's decline from a prizewinning young fighter to an overweight, "has-been" nightclub owner. [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), while labeled as a fast-paced action film, could also be seen as a science fiction art film, along with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968). ''Blade Runner'' explores themes of [[existentialism]], or what it means to be human. A box-office failure, the film became popular on the arthouse circuit as a [[cult film|cult oddity]] after the release of a "director's cut" became successful via [[VHS]] home video. In the middle of the decade, Japanese director Akira Kurosawa used realism to portray the brutal, bloody violence of Japanese samurai warfare of the 16th century in ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). ''Ran'' followed the plot of ''[[King Lear]]'', in which an elderly king is betrayed by his children. [[Sergio Leone]] also contrasted brutal violence with emotional substance in his epic tale of mobster life in ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.
[[File:Ashigara no seki.jpg|thumb|250px|While extensive sets are associated more with mainstream than with art films, Japanese director Akira Kurosawa had many sets built for his 1985 film ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'', including this recreation of a medieval gate.]]

Other directors in the 1980s chose a more intellectual path, exploring philosophical and ethical issues. [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981), a critique of the Polish communist government, won the 1981 [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Another Polish director, [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], made ''[[The Decalogue (film)|The Decalogue]]'' for television in 1988, a film series that explores ethical issues and moral puzzles. Two of these films were released theatrically as ''[[A Short Film About Love]]'' and ''[[A Short Film About Killing]]''. In 1989, [[Woody Allen]] made, in the words of ''New York Times'' critic [[Vincent Canby]], his most "securely serious and funny film to date", ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', which involves multiple stories of people who are trying to find moral and spiritual simplicity while facing dire issues and thoughts surrounding the choices they make. French director [[Louis Malle]] chose another moral path to explore with the dramatization of his real-life childhood experiences in ''[[Au revoir, les enfants]]'', which depicts the occupying Nazi government's deportation of French Jews to concentration camps during World War II.

Kieślowski was not the only director to transcend the distinction between the cinema and television. [[Ingmar Bergman]] made ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' (1982), which was shown on television in an extended five-hour version. In the United Kingdom, [[Channel 4]], a new television channel, financed, in whole or in part, many films released theatrically through its [[Film4 Productions|Film 4]] subsidiary. [[Wim Wenders]] offered another approach to life from a spiritual standpoint in his 1987 film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', a depiction of a "fallen angel" who lives among men, which won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1982, experimental director [[Godfrey Reggio]] released ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', a film without dialogue, which emphasizes cinematography and philosophical ideology. It consists primarily of [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse]] cinematography of cities and natural landscapes, which results in a visual [[Symphonic poem|tone poem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritofbaraka.com/koyaanisqatsi |title=Koyaanisqatsi |work=Spirit of Baraka |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130062225/http://www.spiritofbaraka.com/koyaanisqatsi |archivedate=2010-01-30| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach used by directors in the 1980s was to create bizarre, surreal alternative worlds. [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985) is a comedy-thriller that depicts a man's baffling adventures in a surreal nighttime world of chance encounters with mysterious characters. [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), a [[film noir]]-style thriller-mystery filled with symbolism and metaphors about polarized worlds and inhabited by distorted characters who are hidden in the seamy underworld of a small town, became surprisingly successful considering its highly disturbing subject matter. [[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover]]'' (1989) is a fantasy/[[black comedy]] about [[cannibalism]] and extreme violence with an intellectual theme: a critique of "[[elite]] culture" in [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherian]] Britain.

According to [[Raphaël Bassan]], in his article "''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'': Un météore dans le ciel de l'animation",&lt;ref&gt;''La Revue du cinéma'', n° 393, avril 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s ''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'', shown at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginning of contemporary animation. The characters' masks erase all human personality and give the impression of total control over the "matter" of the image and its optical composition, using distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses, and synthetic objects.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, directors took inspiration from the success of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and [[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover]]'' (1989) and created films with bizarre alternative worlds and elements of surrealism. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' (1990) depicted his imaginative reveries in a series of vignettes that range from idyllic pastoral country landscapes to horrific visions of tormented demons and a blighted post-nuclear war landscape. The [[Coen brothers]]' ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991), which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], features various literary allusions in an enigmatic story about a writer who encounters a range of bizarre characters, including an alcoholic, abusive novelist and a serial killer. ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), from the same director as ''Blue Velvet'', is a psychological [[Thriller film|thriller]] that explores fantasy worlds, bizarre time-space transformations, and mental breakdowns using surreal imagery.

Other directors in the 1990s explored philosophical issues and themes such as identity, chance, death, and existentialism. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991) and [[Wong Kar-wai]]'s ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994) explored the theme of identity. The former is an independent road movie/buddy film about two young street hustlers, which explores the theme of the search for home and identity. It was called a "high-water mark in '90s independent film",&lt;ref&gt;Filmcritic.com critic Jake Euler.&lt;/ref&gt; a "stark, poetic rumination",&lt;ref&gt;Reviewer Nick Schager.&lt;/ref&gt; and an "exercise in film experimentation"&lt;ref&gt;Critic Matt Brunson.&lt;/ref&gt; of "high artistic quality".&lt;ref name="Allmovie.com" /&gt; ''Chungking Express''&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Chungking Express, he directed  ''[[Days of Being Wild]]''. Later in the 1990s, Kar-wai directed ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together (film)]]'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; explores themes of identity, disconnection, loneliness, and isolation in the "metaphoric concrete jungle" of modern Hong Kong.

[[Daryush Shokof]]'s film ''[[Seven Servants]]'' (1996) is an original high art cinema piece about a man who strives to "unite" the world's races until his last breath. One year after ''[[Seven Servants]]'', [[Abbas Kiarostami]]'s film ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' (1997),&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;In 1990, Kiarostami directed ''[[Close-Up (1990 film)|Close-up]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, tells a similar tale with a different twist; both films are about a man trying to hire a person to bury him after he commits suicide. ''[[Seven Servants]]'' was shot in a minimalist style, with long takes, a leisurely pace, and long periods of silence. The film is also notable for its use of long shots and overhead shots to create a sense of distance between the audience and the characters. [[Zhang Yimou]]'s early 1990s works such as ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1990), ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'' (1994) explore human emotions through poignant narratives. ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'' won the Grand Jury Prize.

Several 1990s films explored existentialist-oriented themes related to life, chance, and death. [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993) explores themes of chance, death, and infidelity by tracing 10 parallel and interwoven stories. The film, which won the [[Golden Lion]] and the Volpi Cup at the [[Venice Film Festival]], was called a "many-sided, many mooded, dazzlingly structured eclectic jazz mural" by ''Chicago Tribune'' critic Michael Wilmington. [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]'s ''[[The Double Life of Véronique]]'' (1991) is a drama about the theme of identity and a political allegory about the East/West split in Europe; the film features stylized cinematography, an ethereal atmosphere, and unexplained supernatural elements.

[[Darren Aronofsky]]'s film ''[[π (film)|Pi]]'' (1998) is an "incredibly complex and ambiguous film filled with both incredible style and substance" about a paranoid mathematician's "search for peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/a29bee8a645baf0b882567c0005e8d55?OpenDocument|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230151045/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/a29bee8a645baf0b882567c0005e8d55?OpenDocument|archivedate=2005-12-30 |title=Pi Movie Review, DVD Release – |publisher=Filmcritic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film creates a [[David Lynch]]-inspired "eerie ''[[Eraserhead]]''-like world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623211405/http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=997|archivedate=2008-06-23 |title=Current Movie Reviews, Independent Movies – Film Threat |publisher=Filmthreat.com |date=1998-06-15 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; shot in "black-and-white, which lends a dream-like atmosphere to all of the proceedings" and explores issues such as "metaphysics and spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;Critic James Berardinelli.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Barney]]'s ''[[The Cremaster Cycle]]'' (1994–2002) is a cycle of five symbolic, allegorical films that creates a self-enclosed aesthetic system, aimed to explore the process of creation. The films are filled with allusions to reproductive organs and sexual development, and use narrative models drawn from biography, mythology, and geology.

In 1997, [[Terrence Malick]] returned from a 20-year absence with ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'', a war film that uses poetry and nature to stand apart from typical war movies. It was nominated for seven [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Director.

Some 1990s films mix an ethereal or surreal visual atmosphere with the exploration of philosophical issues. ''[[Satantango]]'' (1994), by the [[Hungarian cinema|Hungarian director]] [[Bela Tarr]], is a {{frac|7|1|2}}-hour-long film, shot in [[black and white]], that deals with Tarr's favorite theme, inadequacy, as [[confidence trick|con man]] Irimias comes back to a village at an unspecified location in Hungary, presenting himself as a leader and [[false Messiah|Messiah figure]] to the gullible villagers. Kieslowski's ''[[Three Colors]]'' trilogy (1993–4), particularly ''[[Three Colors: Blue|Blue]]'' (1993) and ''[[Three Colors: Red|Red]]'' (1994), deal with human relationships and how people cope with them in their day-to-day lives. The trilogy of films was called "explorations of spirituality and existentialism"&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Levy, [http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/three-colors-blue/ review of ''Three Colors: Blue'']. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; that created a "truly transcendent experience".&lt;ref&gt;Matt Brunson.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' listed ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996) as one of its top 25 arthouse films. The reviewer stated that "[a]ll the ingredients that have come to define [[Lars von Trier]]'s career (and in turn, much of modern European cinema) are present here: high-wire acting, innovative visual techniques, a suffering heroine, issue-grappling drama, and a galvanising shot of controversy to make the whole thing unmissable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/breaking-waves-trier-arthouse|title=Breaking the Waves: No 24 best arthouse film of all time|author=Steve Rose|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
A number of films from the 2000s with art film qualities were notable for their use of innovative filmmaking or editing techniques. ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2001), a psychological thriller directed by [[Christopher Nolan]], is about a man suffering from short-term memory loss. The film is edited so that the plot is revealed backwards in ten-minute chunks, simulating the condition of memory loss. ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) is a romance film directed by [[Michel Gondry]] about a man who hires a company to erase the memory of a bad relationship. The film uses a range of special effects techniques and camera work to depict the destruction of the man's memories and his transitions from one memory to another.

''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]'' (2000), a film directed by [[Mike Figgis]], uses a split screen to show four continuous 90-minute takes that follow four storylines. ''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002), a film directed by [[Alexander Sokurov]], took Figgis' use of extended takes even further; it is notable for being the first feature film shot in a single, unedited take. ''[[Waking Life]]'' (2001), an animated film directed by Richard Linklater, uses an innovative digital [[rotoscope]] technique to depict a young man stuck in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;Five years later, Linklater released the [[science fiction film]] ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006), which was also animated with [[Rotoscope]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Mulholland drive(lynch)--.jpg|thumb|The stars and director of the film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Left to right: Actress [[Naomi Watts]], director [[David Lynch]], and actress [[Laura Harring]] and actor [[Justin Theroux]].]]
Several 2000s-era films explored the theme of [[amnesia]] or memory, but unlike ''Memento'', they did so through the use of narrative techniques rather than filmmaking and editing methods. ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), directed by [[David Lynch]], is initially about a young woman who moves to Hollywood and discovers that an amnesiac is living in her house; as the plot progresses, it becomes apparent that the film is holding something deeper in terms of its plot and characters. ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]'' (2003), directed by [[Park Chan-wook]], is about a man imprisoned by a mysterious and brutal captor for 15 years. After his abrupt release, he must then chase his old memories. ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), directed by [[Lee Chang-dong]], starts with the suicide of the male protagonist, and then uses reverse chronology (similar to ''Memento'') to depict the events of the last 20 years, which led the man to want to kill himself.

Some notable films from the 2000s are considered to possess art film qualities yet differed from mainstream films due to controversial subject matter or narrative form. For example, [[Gus Van Sant]]'s film ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' (2003), which depicts [[mass murder]] at a high school and echoes the [[Columbine High School]] massacre, won top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Other films of his include ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]''. [[Todd Haynes]]' complex deconstruction of [[Bob Dylan]]'s persona, ''[[I'm Not There]]'' (2007), tells its story using non-traditional narrative techniques, intercutting the storylines of the six different Dylan-inspired characters. Mexican director [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s film ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' uses [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) to create a fantastical world, imagined by a ten-year-old girl to block out the horror of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

Lewis Beale of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' stated that Australian director [[Andrew Dominik]]'s western film ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007) is "a fascinating, literary-based work that succeeds as both art and genre film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003639817 |title=The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford |accessdate=2007-09-27 |author=Lewis Beale |publisher=[[Film Journal International]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011214428/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003639817 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the action-oriented [[Jesse James]] films of the past, Dominik's unconventional epic perhaps more accurately details the outlaw's relinquishing psyche during the final months of his life as he succumbs to the paranoia of being captured and develops a precarious friendship with his eventual assassin, [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]]. In 2009, director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] claimed that his film ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' about a shy, repressed rage-aholic was "an art house [[Adam Sandler]] film", a reference to the unlikely inclusion of "frat boy" comic Sandler in the film; critic Roger Ebert claims that ''Punch Drunk Love'' "may be the key to all of the Adam Sandler films, and may liberate Sandler for a new direction in his work. He can't go on making those moronic comedies forever, can he? Who would have guessed he had such uncharted depths?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Punch-Drunk Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
The CNN review of Thai director [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]]'s ''[[Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives]]'' (2010) called it "an art film for everyone", unlike his earlier films, which were "considered inaccessible art house fare". This film, which won the 2010 Cannes Palme d'Or, "ties together what might just be a series of beautifully shot scenes with moving and funny musings on the nature of death and reincarnation, love, loss, and karma".&lt;ref&gt;Satraroj, Nick. Movie review: [http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/play/uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-art-film-everyone-487790 "Uncle Boonmee", an art film for everyone]. CNN. Accessed on October 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Weerasethakul is an independent film director, [[screenwriter]], and film producer, who works outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system. His films deal with dreams, nature, sexuality, including his own [[homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;"Creating His Own Language: An Interview With Apichatpong Weerasethakul", Romers, H. ''Cineaste'', page 34, vol. 30, no. 4, Fall 2005, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Western world|Western]] perceptions of [[Thailand]] and Asia. Weerasethakul's films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures (such as placing titles/credits at the middle of a film) and for working with non-actors.

[[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'' (2011) was released after decades of development and won the Palme d'Or at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]; it was highly praised by critics. At the Avon Theater in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], a message was posted about the theater's no-refund policy due to "some customer feedback and a polarized audience response" to the film. The theater stated that it "stands behind this ambitious work of art and other challenging films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/avon_theatre_director_talks_about_his_tree_of_life_disclaimer/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626031334/http://www.indiewire.com/article/avon_theatre_director_talks_about_his_tree_of_life_disclaimer/|archivedate=2011-06-26|title=INTERVIEW: Here's the Story Behind That Theater's No Refund Policy for "Tree of Life"|publisher=indieWIRE|date=June 24, 2011|author=Austin Dale|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), directed by [[Nicolas Winding Refn]], is commonly called an [[arthouse action film]].&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011 |title=Drive (2011) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, director [[Lars von Trier]] released ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', a movie dealing with [[Depressive episode|depression]] and other mental disorders while also showing a family's reaction to an approaching planet that could collide with the Earth. The movie was well received, some claiming it to be Von Trier's masterpiece with others highlighting [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s performance, the visuals, and realism depicted in the movie.

[[Jonathan Glazer]]'s [[Under the Skin (2013 film)|''Under the Skin'']] was screened at the [[2013 Venice Film Festival]] and received a theatrical release through indie studio [[A24 (company)|A24]] the following year. The film, starring [[Scarlett Johansson]], follows an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in human form as she travels around [[Glasgow]], picking up unwary men for sex, harvesting their flesh and stripping them of their humanity. Dealing with themes such as sexuality, humanity, and objectification, the film received positive reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/under_the_skin_2013/|title=Under the Skin|date=4 April 2014|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hailed by some as a masterpiece;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robbie|last=Collin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/under-the-skin/review/|title=Under the Skin: 'simply a masterpiece'|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; critic [[Richard Roeper]] described the film as "what we talk about when we talk about film as art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Roeper|url=http://blog.richardroeper.com/?p=6233|title='Under the Skin': Brilliant mood piece about a fascinating femme fatale|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=April 13, 2014|accessdate=April 21, 2015|via=Richard Roeper Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decade also saw a re-emergence of "art horror" with the success of films like ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[Stoker (film)|Stoker]]'' (2013), ''[[Enemy (2013 film)|Enemy]]'' (2013), ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014), ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2014), ''[[A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night]]'' (2014), ''[[Goodnight Mommy]]'' (2014), ''[[It Follows]]'' (2015) and ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Donald|last=Clarke|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/black-swan-1.1278785|title=Black Swan|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=January 21, 2011|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bilge|last=Ebiri|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/under-the-skin-and-a-history-of-art-horror-film.html#|title=Under the Skin and a History of Art-Horror Film|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/goodnight-mommy-oscars-austria-foreign-film-entry-radius-1201597760/|title=Radius Horror Film 'Goodnight Mommy' Set To Wake Up Oscar Voters As Austria's Entry|publisher=deadline.com|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Benjamin|last=Lee|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/23/did-arthouse-horror-hit-the-witch-trick-us-multiplex-audiences|title=Did arthouse horror hit The Witch trick mainstream US audiences?

===Artistic television===
{{see also|Quality television}}
''Quality artistic television'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Thornton Caldwell|title=''Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television''|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1995|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[television genre]] or style which shares some of the same traits as art films, has been identified. Television shows, such as David Lynch's ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Singing Detective]]'', also have "a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kristin|last=Thompson|title=''Storytelling in Film and Television''|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with much of Lynch's other work (notably the film ''Blue Velvet''), ''Twin Peaks'' explores the gulf between the veneer of small-town respectability and the seedier layers of life lurking beneath its surface. The show is difficult to place in a defined television genre; stylistically, it borrows the unsettling tone and supernatural premises of horror films and simultaneously offers a bizarrely comical parody of American soap operas with a [[Camp (style)|campy]], melodramatic presentation of the morally dubious activities of its quirky characters. The show represents an earnest moral inquiry distinguished by both [[Surreal humor|weird humor]] and a deep vein of [[surrealism]], incorporating highly stylized vignettes, surrealist and often inaccessible artistic images alongside the otherwise comprehensible narrative of events.

Other television shows that have been called "artistic television" include ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for its use of a "flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show".&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Thompson. Available at
[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716104745/http://www.kamera.co.uk/books/new_hollywood_cinema.html Kamera.co.uk].{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Brooker]]'s UK-focused ''[[Black Mirror]]'' television series explores the dark and sometimes satirical themes in modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies; while classified as "speculative fiction", rather than art television, it received rave reviews. HBO's ''[[The Wire]]'' might also qualify as "artistic television", as it has garnered a greater amount of critical attention from academics than most television shows receive. For example, the [[film theory]] journal ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' has featured the show on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=D.|last=Driscoll|url=http://machines.pomona.edu/152-2009/2009/11/02/the-wire-being-taught-at-harvard/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720033154/http://machines.pomona.edu/152-2009/2009/11/02/the-wire-being-taught-at-harvard/|archivedate=July 20, 2011 |title=''The Wire'' Being Taught at Harvard |publisher=Machines.pomona.edu |date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bibliophile Mailing List''' is an [[electronic mailing list]] for [[bookselling|sellers]] and [[book collecting|collectors]] of rare, out-of-print and scarce books. Booksellers, librarians, students, scholars, and book lovers, share news and discussions on all manner of topics of interest to bibliophiles, as well as posting books wanted and books for sale listings.

==History==

The Bibliophile Mailing List was started in 1994 by Michael Medlin at the [[Claremont Colleges]] in the United States. By early 1995 the Iris.Claremont.Edu server hosting the list could no longer handle the bandwidth. The list membership had grown to over 550, and with an average of 15 to 20 posts per day, the volume of email was large. In February 1995 responsibility for managing the list was taken on by Shoshana Edwards, owner of Books From Bree.  The list was moved to [[SmartDOCS.com]] in the [[Santa Clarita Valley]] of Southern California, where it was run on an Oracle-based server.

In the summer of 1997 [[Lynn DeWeese-Parkinson]] took over the list adding a bit of whimsy by changing the title from "List Owner" to "Grand Poohbah" and declaring its location in the polity of Bibliotenango.  The list and the whimsy has continued with events such as the annual "running of the book scouts" on the day of St. [[John of God]], the patron of booksellers. Today its membership is just over 1000 booksellers, collectors, librarians, and general bibliophiles.

==Operation==

Bibliophile is a closed list. Only subscribers are allowed to post and are expected to observe the amenities of good manners and professional behavior. It is not monitored but the discussions are followed by its [[Grand Poohbah]] who attempts to keep them within freely drawn bounds. It has a fee of $30 per year due after a two-week free trial period. Its members are drawn from around the world and include many of the most knowledgeable of bibliophiles.

The straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] and [[lozenges]] and are drawn by the Celts using a [[connect the dots]] method.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

Celtic labyrinths are found among carvings at [[Camonica Valley]], occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one [[Knossos]] or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity [[Cernunnos]]. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing  Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

==Plot==
Upon publication of the obituary for Matthew A. Sobol, a brilliant computer programmer and CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, a [[Daemon (computing)|Daemon]] is activated. Sobol, dying of brain cancer, was fearful for humanity and began to envision a new world order. The Daemon becomes his tool to achieve that vision. The Daemon's first mission is to kill two programmers Joseph Pavlos &amp; Chopra Singh who worked for CyberStorm Entertainment and unknowingly helped in the creation of the Daemon.

The program secretly takes over hundreds of companies and provides financial and computing resources for recruiting real world agents and creating AutoM8s ([[Autonomous car|computer controlled driverless cars]], used as transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and other devices. The Daemon also creates a secondary online web service, hidden from the general public, dubbed the [[Darknet]], which allows Daemon operatives to exchange information freely.

What follows is a series of interlocking stories following the main characters:

'''Detective Pete Sebeck''' is called in to investigate the death of Pavlos. However, when a connection is made between the two programmers and Cyberstorm, the FBI takes over led by Agent Decker. For being the first authority figure in the investigation, the Daemon selects Sebeck against his will to serve the Daemon, which frames Sebeck for its creation as a multi-million scheme and a hoax. The US government, though knowing the truth, fasttracks Sebeck's trial and executes him eight months later. Sebeck makes peace with his wife, who loves him despite Sebeck's having an affair, but his son Chris remains estranged, and he proclaims his innocence while dying from lethal injection. However, Sebeck later awakens to learn that the Daemon faked his death and assigned him the task to prove that humanity deserves its freedom from the Daemon. Joined by a fellow operative named Laney Price, Sebeck vanishes into America.

'''Jon Ross''', a Russian hacker and identity thief, is questioned by the FBI and brought into the investigation by Sebeck. Unfortunately, traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon program. Ross eventually deduces that the Daemon can anticipate their every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere with its operation. Even after being named in the Daemon hoax (and put on the FBI's most wanted list), Ross willingly helps the US government to stop the program. Assigned to the NSA's anti-Daemon task force, with Agent Phillips, he is a firsthand witness to Loki's attack on the installation and barely survives the massacre that follows. With his immunity deal rescinded, he vanishes underground with the intent on destroying the Daemon on his own.

'''Agent Roy "Tripwire" Merritt''' a decorated FBI agent is brought in to secure Sobol's property, when several FBI agents and police officers are killed by an automated Hummer that attacks anyone who approaches. A longtime military officer and expert in hostage situations, he realizes that Sobol's estate is a death trap and red herring, but fear of the Daemon forces his hand and his team is ordered to secure the site regardless. His team is quickly killed, and he remains the lone survivor, infiltrating the house and accidentally triggering a bomb, which levels the property. Blamed for the failure, he is relieved of duty but is later brought onto the anti-Daemon task force by the Major. When Loki is revealed to have infiltrated the building, Roy pursues him, against orders. Fearful of the publicity that the chase will generate, the Major kills Roy himself. Despite being an enemy to the Daemon, he becomes a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity.

'''NSA Agent Natalie Philips''', a genius workaholic government cryptographer. Phillips joins the investigation shortly after the FBI is called in. Eventually, she is placed in charge of the anti-Daemon task force, but she finds plenty of interference from the Major. She is attracted to Jon Ross (the attraction is mutual), but she quickly states that national security will take precedence and their relationship will remain professional. Phillips objects to the murder of Sebeck to protect infected corporate systems from the Daemon's wrath. One of a handful survivors from Loki's attack, Phillips is blamed for the failure and relieved of duties.

'''Brian Gragg''' aka "Loki Stormbringer" is a sociopathic loner and avid gamer. He makes a living through identity theft and other cyber crimes. After running afoul of some hackers from the Philippines, he allows his partner in crime, Jason Heider, to be killed in his place. Needing to lie low, Loki is recruited by the Daemon by outthinking a hidden game level in one of Sobol's games. Loki is the first Daemon operative and quickly becomes one of the most powerful operatives. His behavior, though useful to the Daemon, is hated and feared even by other Darknet members. His first major act is to infiltrate the anti-Daemon task force. When found out, he quickly triggers an attack, which leaves most of the people and agents there dead. He is pursued by Roy Merritt, as he escapes and witnesses the Major executing Roy, vowing to kill the Major for betraying his own man.

'''The Major''', unnamed throughout the series, is introduced as a secret DOD liaison assigned to the daemon task force. Soon, everyone who encounters him realizes that his history is checkered, and his loyalty remains with the military-industrial complex now under attack by the Daemon. When Loki massacres the task force, he quickly contains the situation by destroying all evidence (including leveling the building) and personally executing Roy Merritt, fearful that Merritt's pursuit of Loki will attract too much attention. Realizing that they have underestimated the Daemon and its network, the Major retreats and prepares to wage a secret war against the Daemon and its agents.

'''Anji Anderson''' is a recently fired reporter, whose good looks have hindered her career for years. Having been relegated to fluff pieces and put on the air to be pretty, she is quickly recruited as a Daemon operative, her job to investigate stories that benefit the Daemon and help push its propaganda. Her main effect in the story is to help frame Sebeck.  She eventually becomes the spokesman for the Daemon.

'''Charles Mosely''' is a former drug dealer and convicted killer recruited by the Daemon, which helps him to escape prison by transferring him first to minimum security and then releasing him altogether. With a new identity, he travels to a Daemon-controlled office where he is interrogated by the Daemon's AI and is deemed acceptable to serve. He eventually becomes a security operative, assigned jobs such as executing criminals, participating a massive worldwide assassination of spammers who corrupt the internet. Mosley's only request is for the Daemon to locate his missing son and protect him. Ray is both found and sent to live with Daemon agents, who will raise and educate Ray in a safe family-like setting.

==Dutton purchase==
On June 25, 2008, the [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] imprint of the [[Penguin Group]] purchased ''Daemon'' and the rights to the sequel ''Freedom™'' from Verdugo Press.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[http://verdugopress.com/ Daemon by Leinad Zeraus Acquired by Dutton]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton has since achieved foreign rights sales worth over $1 million.

==Film adaptation==
[[Walter F. Parkes]], who produced the 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'', had optioned the film rights to ''Daemon'' with [[Paramount Pictures]],&lt;ref name="WSJ When"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trachtenberg |first=Jeffrey A. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123678059330595141 |title=When Computers Rule the World |publisher=online.wsj.com |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they likely reverted to Suarez on 8 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Suarez film"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suarez |first=Daniel |url=https://plus.google.com/+DanielSuarez/posts/SjC6iVZGfCb |title=Status of 'Daemon' Movie |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Santa Maria dello Stellario''' (or Church of Stellario)  was a [[catholic]] Church  located in piazza Ciullo, in the town centre of [[Alcamo]], in  the [[province of Trapani]].
==History==  
It was founded in the 17th century by [[Mariano da Alcamo]], a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin| Capuchin]] friar, and consecrated in 1625. As the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] affirms in his work, they carried the [[Holy Sacrament]] and the painting of ''Maria Santissima dello Stellario'' in procession to this Church,  to ask her intercession for rain to come. It had not rained for several months: it rained  continuously for three consecutive days.&lt;ref name=Messi&gt;Messina, Salvatore (2015). Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell'arte. Alcamo: Campo.&lt;/ref&gt;
The founder also created the homonimous [[confraternity]] in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Bembina, G.B. (1956). Alcamo sacra; con note di P. M. Rocca, rivedute ed accresciute da Francesco Maria Mirabella. Alcamo: Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, before being demolished,  the Church was not in bad conditions: in fact, in 1939  Maria De Blasi Casale, a widow,  had financed the restoration of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;"La Chiesa dello Stellario ad Alcamo. Uno scempio impunito"&lt;/ref&gt;
===Description===
The [[façade]] had a fine portal; the Church had a single [[nave]], there were [[Ionic capitals]] and two altars on both sides. On the high altar there was a painting of the titular saint, later missing, realized by  Giuseppe La Ficara in 1651.&lt;ref name=Cata&gt;Cataldo, Carlo (2001). La conchiglia di S.Giacomo. Alcamo: Campo&lt;/ref&gt;The picture, with a low artistic value, represented [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] on a throne of clouds, in the middle of 12 stars and the [[Infant Jesus]] in her arms; there were a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and a capuchin friar on the sides, while the Eternal father and the Holy Ghost were portrayed in the upper part.&lt;ref name=Messi/&gt;

In 1769 the Church was embellished with [[Stucco|stuccoes]];  inside it there were also some ancient crypts which were destroyed during the demolition, made after the building had been sold by the [[Curia (Catholic Church)|Curia]] of Trapani. With the income they bought a piece of land in viale Europa, in order to provide that area with a [[parish Church]], later called [[Church of the Holy Heart (Alcamo)|chiesa del Sacro Cuore]].

===The confraternity of Santa Maria dello Stellario===
It was founded on 21 June 1602 in the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]] and had its oratory inside this Church. From the information that the historian Ignazio De Blasi handed down, we know that its brethren were butchers and farmers.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt; They wore a sack and a visor made with linen cloth,  a fabric mantle with the image of  Maria Santissima dello Stellario, and a big cordon; they went barefoot, with sandals like capuchin friars,  the order which their founder, Father [[Mariano da Alcamo|Mariano Bonofino]],  belonged to.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;
The confraternity dissolved  in the forties.
====Duties of the brethren====  
Here it is the list of their obligations:  
*Being always very diligent, in any occasion 
*Taking part in the [[sung Mass]] and receive Communion on 8th September, festivity of their titular Saint.
*Taking part in the procession of [[Corpus Domini]] and on its [[Octave (liturgy)|Octave]]
*Accompanying dead brethren to their sepulchre and complying with the Easter Precept on [[Maundy Thursday]], in the Church of the Capuchin friars.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;

'''''Gassed''''' is a very large oil painting completed in March 1919 by [[John Singer Sargent]].  It depicts the aftermath of a [[mustard gas]] attack during the [[World War I|First World War]], with a line of wounded soldiers walking towards a [[dressing station]].  Sargent was commissioned by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] to document the war and visited the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in July 1918 spending time with the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] near [[Arras]], and then with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] near [[Ypres]].  The painting was finished in March 1919 and voted picture of the year by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1919.  It is now held by the [[Imperial War Museum]]. It visited the US in 1999 for a series of retrospective exhibitions, and then from 2016 to 2018 for exhibitions commemorating the centenary of the First World War.

The painting measures {{convert|231.0|x|611.1|cm|ftin}}. The composition includes a central group of eleven soldiers depicted nearly life-size.  Nine wounded soldiers walk in a line, in three groups of three, along a [[duckboard]] towards a [[dressing station]], suggested by the guy ropes to the right side of the picture.  Their eyes are bandaged, blinded by the effect of the gas, so they are assisted by two [[medical orderly|medical orderlies]].  The line of tall, blond soldiers forms a naturalist allegorical frieze, with connotations of a religious procession.  Many other dead or wounded soldiers lie around the central group, and a similar train of eight wounded, with two orderlies, advances in the background.  Biplanes dogfight in the evening sky above, as a watery setting sun creates a pinkish yellow haze and burnishes the subjects with a golden light.  In the background, the moon also rises, and uninjured men play [[association football]] in blue and red shirts, seemingly unconcerned at the suffering all around them.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/wars_conflict/art/art_frontline_gal_01.shtml|title = Art from Different Fronts of World War One|publisher = [[BBC]]| accessdate = May 21, 2010 | last=Tolson  | first= Roger |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sargent, John SInger (1856-1925) - Self-Portrait 1907 b.jpg|thumb|upright|John Singer Sargent. ''Self Portrait'' c. 1906.]]

In May 1918, Sargent was one of several painters commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee of the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] to create a large painting for a planned [[Hall of Remembrance]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= November 13, 2008|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/13/gassed-john-singer-sargent#|title = 'Gassed', by John Singer Sargent|format = |publisher = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = May 21, 2010 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was a complement to the artworks commissioned by the [[Canadian War Memorials Fund]] since 1916 at the instigation of [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] who, by 1918, was serving as the British Minister of Information.  Other works were commissioned from [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Henry Lamb]], [[# John Nash (artist)|John Nash]] and [[Stanley Spencer]].  The large scale of the works was inspired by [[Uccello]]'s triptych ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]''.  The plan for a Hall of Remembrance decorated by large paintings was abandoned when the project was incorporated with that for [[Imperial War Museum]].

As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a work embodying Anglo-American co-operation.  Although he was 62 years old, he travelled to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in July 1918, accompanied by [[Henry Tonks]].&lt;ref name=iwm&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent time with the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] near [[Arras]], and then with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] near [[Ypres]].  He was determined to paint an epic work with many human figures, but struggled to find a situation with American and British figures in the same scene.  On 11 September 1918, Sargent wrote to [[Evan Charteris]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Ministry of Information expects an epic – and how can one do an epic without masses of men? Excepting at night I have only seen three fine subjects with masses of men – one a harrowing sight, a field full of gassed and blindfolded men – another a train of trucks packed with "[[cannon fodder|chair à cannon]]" – and another frequent sight a big road encumbered with troops and traffic, I daresay the latter, combining English and Americans, is the best thing to do, if it can be prevented from looking like going to the Derby.&lt;ref name="christies.com"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:MustardGasChemicalBurns.JPG|thumb|upright|An American soldier with life-threatening mustard gas burns in 1918.]]

The "harrowing sight" referred to the aftermath of a German barrage that Sargent witnessed on 21 August 1918, at Le Bac-du-Sud, near [[Bailleulval]] between [[Arras]] and [[Doullens]], in which [[mustard gas]] had been used against the advancing 99th Brigade of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]] and [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Brigade]] of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] of the [[British Army]], during the Second Battle of Arras of 1918.&lt;ref name= "Harris p. "/&gt;  Tonks described the experience in a letter from to [[Alfred Yockney]] on 19 March 1920:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After tea we heard that on the Doullens Road at the Corps dressing station at le Bac-du-sud there were a good many gassed cases, so we went there. The dressing station was situated on the road and consisted of a number of huts and a few tents. Gassed cases kept coming in, lead along in parties of about six just as Sargent has depicted them, by an orderly. They sat or lay down on the grass, there must have been several hundred, evidently suffering a great deal, chiefly I fancy from their eyes which were covered up by a piece of lint... Sargent was very struck by the scene and immediately made a lot of notes. It was a very fine evening and the sun toward setting.&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Ormond, John Singer Sargent Paintings drawings watercolours, London, 1970, p. 258, quoted in the lot notes at [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4112681 Christies]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sargent worked on preparatory sketches for a road scene crowded with soldiers, but decided to focus on the dressing station.  The War Memorials Committee agreed to change the subject of the commission, and the painting was created at Sargent's studio in [[Fulham]] from late 1918 through early 1919.&lt;ref name="christies.com"/&gt;

The painting was completed in March 1919, and Sargent was paid his £600 fee.  It was first displayed at the Royal Academy in London in 1919.&lt;ref name="molinterv.aspetjournals.org"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/content/7/3/124.full.pdf|title = Torald Sollmann's Studies of Mustard Gas|format = |publisher = Reflections| accessdate = May 21, 2010 | last= Cox |pages=124–128| first= Brian M.|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was voted picture of the year by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1919.&lt;ref name= "Harris p.

It sold for £162,050 ($267,869).&lt;ref name="christies.com"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= June 11, 2003 |year= 2010|url =http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4112681|title = John Singer Sargent (1856–1925) Gassed, an oil study |format = |publisher = [[Christie's]]| accessdate = May 21, 2010 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting provides a powerful testimony of the effects of chemical weapons, vividly described in [[Wilfred Owen]]'s poem ''[[Dulce et Decorum Est]]''. Mustard gas is a persistent [[vesicant]] [[poison gas|gas]], with effects that only become apparent several hours after exposure.  It attacks the skin, eyes and mucous membranes, causing large skin blisters, blindness, choking and vomiting.  Death, although rare, can occur within two days, but suffering may be prolonged over several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pathological Action of War Gasses - General Considerations |work= |publisher=The Medical Front WWI |date= |url=http://www.vlib.us/medical/gaswar/gaspath.htm |doi= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent's painting refers to Bruegel's 1568 work ''[[The Parable of the Blind]]'', with the [[blind leading the blind]].  It also alludes to Rodin's ''[[Burghers of Calais]]''.

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style arrived in [[Poland]] in the first half of the 13th century with the arrival of members of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The first elements of the new style are evident in the foundation of the Dominican Trinity church in [[Kraków]] (1226–1250),&lt;ref name="Strzala-2"&gt;Marek Strzala, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120308154924/http://www.krakow-info.com/Kaz_walk.htm Stroll through the historic Kazimierz area.] ''Krakow Info.com'' (Internet Archive). Retrieved {{nobreak|February 13, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; built by Bishop [[Iwo Odrowąż]]. Another of the earliest manifestations of the Gothic in Poland was the rebuilding of the [[Wrocław Cathedral]] which started in 1244. The earliest building was completely covered in Poland, built in Gothic style chapel is considered [[Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica|St. Hedwig in Trzebnica]] (1268–1269) in the monastery of Cistercian. 

In the north and west of the country, there are some scarce [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] predecessors (see [[Brick Romanesque#Poland|here]]). Most Gothic buildings in Poland are made of [[brick]], and belong to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] [[Brick Gothic]], especially in northern Poland (see [[List of Brick Gothic buildings#Poland|Significant Brick Gothic buildings in Poland]]). Nonetheless, not all Gothic buildings in Poland are made of brick. For example, the [[Wawel]] Cathedral in Kraków is mostly stone-built. Poland also has some Gothic [[fieldstone church]]es, mostly of relatively small size. The centers of Polish Gothic are Kraków, [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]] and [[Wrocław]].

The reign of the king [[Casimir the Great]] was the time of the greatest flowering of gothic architecture in Poland. For the second time a similar development took place in the late Gothic phase, during the reign of [[Casimir the Jagiellonian]].

In the region of [[Lesser Poland]] (on the south) buildings were built of brick with stone blocks to the implementation details. Churches built in the area are often two-nave. Are also found very high basilica of the aisles. Silesia resembles gothic solution of Malopolska with influences from the Czech. Here, too, in addition to the blows of stone bricks were used. One of the characteristics is the location of the tower – at the intersection of the transept of the church choir, on the south-east. The architecture of the northern lands strongly influenced patterns inspired by the [[Teutonic Order]] state buildings and other cities of [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]]. Brick churches are mainly [[Pomerania]] halls of mighty towers, usually situated in the main axis. Much less common is the basilica. In [[Mazovia]] not developed different forms of Gothic. Occurring on this earth buildings are characterized by rather simplified forms already known.

== Castles ==
From the 13th century began to modernize the seat of royal and princely expanding existing buildings functional program (such as [[Wawel Castle]], [[Legnica]]), and building castles, which initially could be built only with the consent of the ruler. For this reason, the oldest castles have public character of the building. Initially, in the 13th century, the characteristic elements of the locks were placed in a role within the wood-earth castles, so the first castles were irregular in shape (e.g., in [[Opole]]). After the mid-13th century abandoned the construction palatiów to be connected rather with the earlier epoch. Regular shape of castles spread throughout the Polish Kingdom in the reign of Casimir the Great, and built them into this shape, even in areas of previous castles (Rawa, Łęczyca, Koło). Castles and monasteries built by Joannites (Stare Drawsko, [[Łagów, Świebodzin County|Łagów]], [[Swobnica]], [[Pęzino]]) and the Teutonic Order, in the state created by them in Prussia (Malbork, [[Radzyń Chełmiński]], [[Niedzica]]) and bishops (in Lipowiec). The castles were built or final defense towers (known as stołp) and residential towers (donżon). 

The best preserved Gothic castles are:
* in [[Lesser Poland]]: [[Chęciny]], [[Odrzykoń]], [[Czorsztyn]], [[Niedzica]], Kazimierz Dolny, [[Bobolice]], [[Będzin]], Lipowiec, [[Ogrodzieniec]] and others on [[Trail of the Eagles' Nests]]
* in northern Poland: built by the Teutonic Order in [[Malbork]], [[Nidzica]], Golub, Radzyń Chełmiński, [[Gniew]]; or on their strongholds modeled (usually built on the estates of bishops) in [[Kwidzyn]], Lidzbark Warmiński, [[Olsztyn]], [[Reszel]].
* in [[Mazovia]]: Castle in [[Ciechanów]], [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]], [[Liw, Poland|Liw]].
* in [[Greater Poland]]: Castle in the [[Koło]], [[Szamotuły]], [[Gołańcz]], [[Łęczyca]].
* in [[Lower Silesia]]: [[Siedlęcin Tower]], [[Bolków]], [[Chojnik]], [[Żmigród]], [[Świny, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Świny]]

== Town halls ==
A town hall called [[Ratusz]] was a symbol of a city's power in the Middle Ages.  Around the town hall were other buildings associated with the function of the urban organism: hall, municipal building, weight, merchant stalls and pillory.  Examples of unconverted later Gothic town halls include the [[Wrocław Town Hall]], the Old Town Hall in Toruń and town halls in Chojna, Gdańsk and Szczecin.&lt;ref name="jaktrafic"&gt;[http://www.jaktrafic.org/ratusze/regulamin_ratusze.pdf Szlakiem Rynków i Ratuszy w Polsce] [[PTTK]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gosciniec"&gt;Elżbieta Zagłoba-Zygler, [http://gosciniec.pttk.pl/16_2004/index.php?co=061 20 lat rajdu motorowego PTTK "Ratusze w Polsce"] "Gosciniec" Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, PTTK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosikon"&gt;Janusz Rosikoń, [http://www.rosikonpress.com/dzial_48/towar_karta_4/Ratusze_w_Polsce.html Ratusze w Polsce] Rosikon Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Only [[Town Hall Tower, Kraków|the Gothic tower]] of [[Kraków Town Hall|the Ratusz town hall]] in [[Kraków]] has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Janicki, [http://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2012/01/19/co-sie-stalo-z-krakowskim-ratuszem/ Co się stało z krakowskim ratuszem?] Ciekawostki turystyczne.&lt;/ref&gt; The gothic town hall on the Old Town Market Square in Warsaw was demolished in 1820.

== Houses ==
Existing settlements received in the 13th and 14th centuries tracking new laws (usually based on [[Magdeburg Law]]). Urban area is usually divided grid of streets perpendicular to the plot by creating a chessboard layout. Residential buildings, in the upper reaches is still built of wood or timber-framed art. In order to prevent the transmission of fire during the fire, often the wall was increased at the border of two adjacent parcels and tracts of gable roof receives addressed to the agent. Facades of houses stepped or triangular peaks. Houses of rich burghers sometimes received in the form of a richer decor. More often it was a topic mimicking polychrome wall, and wimpergi tracery. An example of building in the Gothic style is the house of Copernicus in Torun, in Sandomierz Długosz House, oldest building of Jagiellonian University – Collegium Maius, building on ul. Łazienna 22 in Toruń.

== Town walls and town gates ==
The city walls surrounded, sometimes in place of the earlier shafts and such investment is carried out for many years, making frequent upgrades. Older consolidation often was increased. The sequence is often interrupted by walls tower. Cities sometimes receive a new, second belt walls (e.g., Wrocław, Toruń). Leading to the ornate gates of cities often preceded the late Gothic period barbakanami connected with them neck. First this form of defense on Polish soil was established in Toruń – Barbican Starotoruński of 1426, the best preserved in Poland barbican Barbican in Kraków. To this day preserved fragments of walls, of which most survived the gate, for example, in [[Szydłów]], [[Sandomierz]], Kraków [[St. Florian's Gate]] and the [[Kraków barbican]]. Significant parts of the walls have been preserved in [[Stargard Szczeciński|Stargard]], [[Pyrzyce]], [[Byczyna]], Toruń. In [[Chełmno]] and [[Paczków]] city walls are preserved almost in its entirety.

== Churches ==
Gothic churches can be found all over Poland, especially in major cities of late medieval Poland, including [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Gdańsk]]. The [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk|St. Mary's Church]] in Gdańsk is the largest brick church in the world. The Pelplin Cathedral in [[Pelplin]], [[Pomerania]] is one of the largest churches in Poland. Kraków's [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] and [[Wawel Cathedral]] are among the most recognisable landmarks of entire Poland.

'''''Heart of Darkness''''' (1899) is a [[novella]] by Polish-English novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] about a narrated voyage up the [[Congo River]] into the [[Congo Free State]] in the so-called ''heart of Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Marlow]], the narrator, tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the [[River Thames]]. This setting provides the [[frame story|frame]] for Marlow's story of his obsession with the ivory trader [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]], which enables Conrad to create a parallel between what Conrad calls "the greatest town on earth", [[London]], and Africa as places of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''" in ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 2036.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between so-called civilised people and those described as savages; ''Heart of Darkness'' raises questions about [[imperialism]] and racism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology'', 7th edition, (2000), p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally issued as a three-part serial story in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' to celebrate the thousandth edition of the magazine,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Scotland: Blackwoods magazine exhibition.  In Blackwood's, the story is titled "The Heart of Darkness" but when published as a separate book the "The" was dropped from the title.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heart of Darkness'' has been widely re-published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Heart of Darkness'' 67th on their list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best novels]] in English of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html 100 Best] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207224252/http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |date=7 February 2010 }}, Modern Library's website.

==Composition and publication==
In 1890, at the age of 32, Conrad was appointed by a Belgian trading company to serve on one of its [[Steamboat|steamers]]. While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]. The story's main narrator, Charles Marlow, has similar experiences to the author himself.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Conrad.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Conrad]] based ''Heart of Darkness'' on his own experiences in the [[Congo Basin|Congo]].]]
When Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as "a wild story" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. Thus described, the subject seems comic, but isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was first published as a three-part serial, February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). Then later, in 1902, ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'' (published on 13 November 1902, by [[William Blackwood]]).

The volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''The End of the Tether'' in that order. For future editions of the book, in 1917 Conrad wrote an "[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]" where he, after denying any "unity of artistic purpose" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories, and makes light commentary on the character Marlow—the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He also mentions how ''Youth'' marks the first appearance of Marlow.

On 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in—as it were—the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and later died aboard Conrad's steamer, has been identified by scholars and literary critics as one basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous "rear column" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition's overall leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ho"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=0-395-75924-2 |pages=98, 145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYo-DO4tr-gC&amp;pg=PA98 |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[Léon Rom]] is the most important influence on the character.&lt;ref&gt;Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999).

==Plot summary==
Aboard the ''Nellie'', anchored in the [[River Thames]] near [[Gravesend]], England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an [[Ivory trade|ivory trading]] company. As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by "the blank spaces" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into "a place of darkness" (Conrad 10). Yet there remained a big river, "resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land" (Conrad 10). The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow "as a snake would a bird" (Conrad 10). Feeling as though "instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18). After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in "the gloomy circle of some Inferno": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24–25). Marlow witnesses the scene "horror-struck" (Conrad 26).

Marlow has to wait for ten days in the Company's Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a "'very remarkable person'" who "'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'" (Conrad 28). The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: "'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be'" (Conrad 29).

[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]

Marlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumours had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, was ill. "Hang Kurtz", Marlow thinks, irritated (Conrad 34). He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is "a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch" (Conrad 39). Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz "'a prodigy'" and "'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'", and feels Kurtz represents the "'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39). The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: "'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'" (Conrad 39–40).

Marlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. During this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).

Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months to the day. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.

[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' ("King of the Belgians"—French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]
The journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads "Exterminate all the brutes!" (Conrad 83).

At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power—and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.

From the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are "unsound". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.

[[File:LeonRom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Léon Rom]], photographed {{circa}} 1880, who some have argued served as the inspiration for Kurtz]]
After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.

Kurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: "The horror! The horror!" (Conrad 116). A short while later, the "manager's boy" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" (Conrad 117). The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury "something" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117). He falls very ill, himself near death.

Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the "civilised" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée, whom Kurtz referred to as "My Intended" (Conrad 79). When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.

==Reception==
Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's "unique propensity for ambiguity". However, it was not a big success during Conrad's life.&lt;ref name="Bloom2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two more novellas, "Youth" and "The End of the Tether", it received the least commentary from critics.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; [[F. R. Leavis]] referred to ''Heart of Darkness'' as a "minor work" and criticised its "adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery".&lt;ref name="Moore5"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad himself did not consider it to be particularly notable.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; By the 1960s, though, it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for the whole sentence.|date=April 2018}}

In ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' (1998), [[Adam Hochschild]] wrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects of ''Heart of Darkness'', while paying scant attention to Conrad's accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. "''Heart of Darkness'' is experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hochschild|1999|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques include Hugh Curtler's ''Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curtler, Hugh|title=Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness|journal=Conradiana|volume=29|issue= 1|date=March 1997|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving beyond ideology critique, French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe called ''Heart of Darkness'' "one of the greatest texts of Western literature" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on "The Horror of the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/conrads-heart-of-darkness-and-contemporary-thought-9781441101006/|title=The Horror of the West|last=Lacoue-Labarthe|first=Philippe|website=|publisher=Bloomsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that "depersonalises a portion of the human race", and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.&lt;ref name=Achebe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achebe|first=Chinua|title=An Image of Africa|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3818468|work=Research in African Literatures|year=1978|accessdate=13 December 2013|doi=10.2307/3818468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be "sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa".&lt;ref name="Moore6"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Botswanan scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was "the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Mwikisa, Peter. "Conrad's Image of Africa: Recovering African Voices in ''Heart of Darkness''. ''Mots Pluriels'' 13 (April 2000): 20–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, British academic [[Cedric Watts]] criticized Achebe's apparent assertion that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella. Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison of ''Heart of Darkness'' with '' Jungle Tales of Tarzan'', "The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Stan. ''The Teenage Tarzan: A Literary Analysis of Edgar Rice Burroughs'', ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Caryl Phillips]] stated in 2003 that: "Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Caryl|title=Out of Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/classics.chinuaachebe|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent critics have stressed that the "continuities" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of "postcolonial mimesis" ties the two authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nidesh |last=Lawtoo |title=A Picture of Africa: Frenzy, Counternarrative, Mimesis |journal=Modern Fiction Studies |volume=59 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=26–52 |doi=10.1353/mfs.2013.0000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and influences==

===Radio and stage plays===
[[Orson Welles]] adapted and starred in ''Heart of Darkness'' in a [[CBS Radio]] broadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series, ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, "the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast."&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

In 1991, Australian author and playwright [[Larry Buttrose]] wrote and staged a theatrical production of ''Kurtz'' (based on ''Heart of Darkness'') with the Crossroads Theatre Company, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsB/buttrose-larry.html|title=Larry Buttrose|publisher=doollee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by the [[Vision Australia Radio]] Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|title=Vision Australia|publisher=Visionaustralia.org|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801191453/http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the RPH – [[Radio Print Handicapped Network]] across Australia.

In 2011, an [[Heart of Darkness (opera)|operatic adaptation]] by composer [[Tarik O'Regan]] and librettist [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] was premiered at the [[Linbury Studio Theatre|Linbury Theatre]] of the [[Royal Opera House]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 Royal Opera House Page for ''Heart of Darkness''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020223221/http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 |date=20 October 2011 }} by [[Tarik O'Regan]] and [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]&lt;/ref&gt; A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it.&lt;ref name=RPO&gt;{{Citation|title=''Suite from Heart of Darkness'' first London performance|publisher=Cadogan Hall|url=http://www.cadoganhall.com/event/royal-philharmonic-orchestra-130423/|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an adaption of Orson Welles' screenplay by Jamie Lloyd and Laurence Bowen was aired on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orson Welles' Heart of Darkness, Unmade Movies, Drama – BBC Radio 4|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06k9bz9|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production starred [[James McAvoy]] as Marlow.

===Film and television===
The [[CBS]] television anthology ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' aired a 90-minute loose adaptation in 1958. This version, written by [[Stewart Stern]], uses the encounter between Marlow ([[Roddy McDowall]]) and Kurtz ([[Boris Karloff]]) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son. The cast includes [[Inga Swenson]] and [[Eartha Kitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cast and credits are available at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675574/ "The Internet Movie Database"]. Retrieved 2 December 2010. A full recording of the show can be viewed onsite by members of the public upon request at [[The Paley Center for Media]] (formerly the Museum of Television &amp; Radio) in New York City and Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous adaptation is [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 motion picture ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' based on the screenplay by [[John Milius]], which moves the story from the Congo to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=29 September 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/03/movies/critic-s-notebook-aching-heart-of-darkness.html |title= Aching Heart of Darkness  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 August 2001 |author=Scott, A. O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Apocalypse Now'', [[Martin Sheen]] plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain assigned to "terminate the command" of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. [[Marlon Brando]] played Kurtz, in one of his most famous roles. A production documentary of the film, titled ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', exposed some of the major difficulties which director Coppola faced in seeing the movie through to completion. The difficulties that Coppola and his crew faced mirrored some of the themes of the book.

On 13 March 1993 [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] aired [[Heart of Darkness (1993 film)|a new version of the story]] directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], starring [[Tim Roth]] as Marlow and [[John Malkovich]] as Kurtz.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken.

===Video games===
The video game ''[[Far Cry 2]],'' released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive "Jackal". The last area of the game is called 'The Heart of Darkness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/feature-far-cry-2s-heart-darkness/|title=The Darkness|author=Mikel Reparaz|date=30 July 2007|work=GamesRadar+}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infovore.org/archives/2008/12/22/africa-wins-again/ |title=Africa Wins Again: Far Cry 2’s literary approach to narrative |publisher=Infovore.org |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/far-cry-2-jorge-albor|title=Far Cry 2 – Jorge Albor – ETC Press|work=Cmu.edu|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]],'' released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of special-ops agent Martin Walker as he and his team search [[Dubai]] for survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to the author of the novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/886896-spec-ops-the-line-preview-heart-of-darkness|title=Spec Ops: The Line preview – heart of darkness|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Victoria II]]'', a grand strategy game produced by [[Paradox Interactive]], launched an expansion pack titled "Heart of Darkness" on 16 April 2013, which  revamped the game's colonial system, and naval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxplaza.com/victoria-2-heart-of-darkness|title=Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness – Paradox Interactive|publisher=Paradoxplaza.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
The novel ''Hearts of Darkness'', by Paul Lawrence, moves the events of the novel to England in 1666. Marlow's journey into the jungle is reimagined as the journey of the narrator, Harry Lytle, and his friend Davy Dowling out of London and towards Shyam, a plague-stricken town that has descended into cruelty and barbarism loosely modelled on real-life [[Eyam]]. While Marlow must return to civilisation with Kurtz, Lytle and Dowling are searching for the spy James Josselin. Like Kurtz, Josselin's reputation is immense, and the protagonists are well-acquainted with his accomplishments by the time they finally meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisonandbusby.com/book/heart-of-darkness-hardback|title=Hearts of Darkness|publisher=Allisonandbusby.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet Yedda Morrison's 2012 book ''Darkness'' erases Conrad's novella, "whiting out" his text so that only images of the natural world remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|title=Yedda Morrison|first=Yedda|last=Morrison|publisher=Yeddamorrison.com|accessdate=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518070748/http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Reich's ''Mistah Kurtz! A Prelude to Heart of Darkness'' presents the early life of Kurtz, his appointment to his station in the Congo, and his messianic disintegration in a novel that dovetails with the conclusion of Conrad's novella. Reich's novel is premised upon the papers Kurtz leaves to Marlow at the end of ''Heart of Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2016/03/14/qa-with-james-reich-author-of-mistah-kurtz/|title=Q&amp;A with James Reich, Author of Mistah Kurtz|last=Hurley|first=Brian|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Josef Škvorecký]]'s novel ''[[The Engineer of Human Souls]]'' Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism, and here and elsewhere Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad's concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Škvorecký, Josef (1984).  [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/crossc/ANW0935.1984.001/269:21?rgn=author;view=image;q1=Skvorecky%2C+Josef "Why the Harlequin?  On Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''."]  ''Cross Currents:  A Yearbook of Central European Culture'', vol. 3, pp. 259-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" at the beginning of the poem ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', quoting the "manager's boy" when he announced the death of Kurtz to the crew.

'''Illustria''' is a branding agency that provides design services (web, digital, UI/UX, print, infographics). Their mission is to make the agency experience transparent, inclusive, and accountable.

==History==
While the founders were working on a previous start-up, they found it difficult to find professional and accessible design services. Illustria came about as a way to provide these services to others.

Founder &amp; CEO, Katherine Long initially believed that only small businesses would be interested in the company's services, but after calling multiple companies&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.bplans.com/you-have-an-idea-for-a-business-now-what/&lt;/ref&gt; found that even larger businesses experienced the same types of pain that could be solved by Illustria's business model.

==Services==
Illustria is a branding agency based in Washington, DC that uses an objective branding process to ensure that they enable you to tell your story accurately. With brand strategy at the center, Illustria's capabilities extend to UI/UX website &amp; application design, general graphic design, and development. Illustria follows a unique set of five methods to guide their process: Nothing Surface Level, Open &amp; Honest Communication, Members, Not Clients, Dedicated Team, and  Zero Big Reveals.

==Reception==
Illustria has worked with companies like the [[WWE]], [[Hubspot]], [[XEROX Parc]] and more. The company has received reviews that praise their [[turnaround time]] as well as the designs that they have provided.

An international colour day (ICD) has been considered as appropriate since [[colour]] is, thanks to [[visual perception]], one of the most influential phenomena in people’s lives and also one of the channels that contributes most greatly to the perception of reality. All around the world memorable colour activities are increasingly being developed during the International Colour Day.

==Background==
The adoption of an international day of colour was proposed in 2008 by the Portuguese Color Association, whose president, [http://www.fa.ulisboa.pt/docentes/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1398%3Amaria-joao-de-carvalho-durao-dos-santos&amp;catid=78%3Adefault-registration&amp;lang=pt Maria Joao Durao], presented the idea to the [[International Colour Association]]. The proposal was agreed in 2009 among the members of this society, which is composed of national associations and members representing more than 30 countries.

==Why March 21st / The Equinox==
The choice of the date comprised a good deal of discussion. Among all suggestions, the idea exposed by Leonhard Oberascher (from Austria) prevailed: every year, March 21 is the “[[equinox]]” – aequus (equal) and nox (night). Around the equinox, the night and day are approximately equally long, symbolically relating to the complementary nature of [[light]] and darkness, light and shadow expressed in all human cultures.

==Logo==
There was an international competition for the design of the logo, and the winner was announced at the 2012 meeting of the [[International Colour Association]], AIC 2012 held in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. As expressed by designer Hosanna Yau, from Hong Kong, "two circles form an eye, with an equal half of rainbow color and black representing light and darkness, day and night, everyone feast one's eye on the international color day."

==Activities==
Some of the activities and events that are unfolded on the International Colour Day: 
* Arts exhibitions, architectural projects, design, decoration, fashion....
* Meetings, debates, scientific events...
* Workshops on the use of [[colour]] and [[light]] for both adults and children.
* Contests on colour and light design.
* Wearing national or regional identity colours.

'''''Libuše and Přemysl''''' (Czech: '''''Libuše a Přemysl''''') is an outdoor sculpture by [[Josef Václav Myslbek]] made in 1889-1897 for [[Palacký Bridge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38217">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Clone High'' characters}}
This is a list of all the characters that have appeared in the animated American-Canadian [[science fiction|science-fiction]]/[[situation comedy]] series ''[[Clone High]]'' (2002–2003). The series was created by the duo [[Phil Lord and Chris Miller]]. It still occasionally airs reruns on [[Teletoon]] and was briefly aired by [[MTV]] and [[MTV2]] in 2003.

==Development==
According to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that "We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun." Lord adds, "The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/17/entertainment/et-solomon17|title=Freshman animators|publisher=articles.latimes.com|date=2003-02-27|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a " party animal" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was "immature" and "into partying" before witnessing the suffering in [[South Africa]]. Another was the reason why they introduced Ponce De León so late in the show, as a parody of how ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' would bring in characters that were never seen before and then kill them off in a melodramatic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cloneparents.jpg|500px|left|thumb|List of main characters and their cloneparents, left to right: Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra and Gandhi]] --&gt;

===Abe Lincoln===
'''Abe Lincoln''' is the clone of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the 16th [[President of the United States]]. He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.

He has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode ''Plane Crazy''.

Abe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into [[peer pressure]] despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over.

He is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his "girl friend, not his girlfriend", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK.

He is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque [[Lincoln Continental]]. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is "[[Home run|Dinger]]!" often said out of great excitement or frustration.

Abe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek

Voice by [[Will Forte]]. ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.

===Joan of Arc===
'''Joan of Arc''' is the clone of [[Joan of Arc|Jeanne d'Arc]], the devout 15th century [[France|French]] militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration.

In the episode ''ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder'' Joan admits to being a "[[goth fashion|goth]]" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a [[bimbo]] and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment.

Joan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too "outspoken". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an [[orthodontic retainer]]. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. 

She is 16 years old. She is an [[agnostic]] (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover'', Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as ''[[Janeane Garofalo]]esque''.

Joan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, [[shades of red|dark red hair]], wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather [[minidress]] with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, [[fishnet stockings]] and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair.

Voice by [[Nicole Sullivan]].

===Mahatma Gandhi===
'''Gandhi''' is the clone of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[India]]n activist of the [[Indian Revolution]]. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him.

The reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy.

Gandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover''. Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as "GFK". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship.

It is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a [[booster seat]] when riding in a car). His favorite movie is ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper ''The Tatler'' in which he reviews movies.&lt;ref name="[[Indian Express]]"&gt;{{cite news | last= O'Brien | first= Irene | title = Now MTV clones Gandhi, chips away at Mahatma | date=2003-01-29 |publisher=Indian Express | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/17449/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably "[[G-spot]]" and "[[G-force]]". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers.

Gandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking [[emaciated]]) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.

His portrayal as a party animal enraged many in [[India]], including prominent members of [[Parliament of India|India's parliament]].&lt;ref name="Grossberg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh |last=Grossberg |title=MTV Apologizes for Gandhi Goofing |date=2003-01-31 |publisher=E!

Voice by actor [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]].

===Cleopatra Smith===
'''Cleopatra Smith''' is the clone of [[Cleopatra VII]], the last [[Pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Cleopatra or "Cleo" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest.

She is a very selfish, [[snobbery|snobby]], cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and [[materialistic]] stereotypical [[school diva]] who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her "[[queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]]" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image.

She became Abe's girlfriend since the episode ''Plane Crazy''. Cleo is portrayed as [[seductive]], hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually [[promiscuous]] and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves.

Despite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death.

She is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for ''The Tatler'' in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of [[Macedonian people|Macedonian]] descent.

Cleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple [[lingerie]] and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral.

Voice by actress [[Christa Miller]], the wife of Clone High producer [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]].

===John F. Kennedy (JFK)===

'''JFK''' is the clone of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school [[jock (athlete)|jock]]. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realizes that he is in love with Joan and despises the way Abe callously treats her by ignoring her feelings for him.

It is shown in episodes ''Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo'' and in ''Raisin the Stakes'', that JFK is a very [[charisma|good speaker]]. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic [[New England English|New England]] dialect and a [[Boston accent]] (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches "-er" suffix with "-ah" and also uses "er" and "uh" as [[filler (linguistics)|filler]] which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent [[machismo|macho]] exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his [[narcissism]] and his [[libido]]. He also has a penchant for using [[toilet humor|dirty jokes]] and [[innuendo]]. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others.

Despite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the [[Kennedy curse]] - "Nothing bad ever happens to the [[Kennedys]]" and "I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he [[Apollo program|conquered the moon]]. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest.

He is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' drove a 1950s-esque [[Chevrolet Corvette|corvette]] which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly "hand gun" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to "John Dark" (Joan in [[crossdressing|drag]]). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out "Bobby!", a reference to [[Robert F. Kennedy]].

JFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown [[loafers]]. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including [[Addison's disease]]).

Voice by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller.]] Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.

===Principal Scudworth===

'''Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D.''' is a deluded, self-aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and if absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed [[amusement park]].

He is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said "so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment.

Scudworth apparently had a son named "Brian Parker Scudworth" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten.&lt;ref name="The Tatler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tatler Issue #6 |date=2003-08-13 |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223090525/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |archivedate=December 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small [[soul patch]] under his lower lip.

Voice by Phil Lord.

===Mr. Lynn Butlertron===
'''Mr. Lynn Butlertron''' is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of [[Mr. Belvedere]]). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone "Wesley", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch.

Mr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly [[sentient]] (though its unknown on how he can feel [[physical sensations]]) and possesses [[artificial intelligence]] that which enables him to show human emotions, have [[free will]] and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students.

Voice by Christopher Miller.

===The Shadowy Figure===
'''The Secret Board of Shadowy Figures''' is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by [[Puma AG|Puma]]. They appear as a parody of the [[CIA]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[NSA]] and [[Area 51]]. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged [[white people|white]] male agents.

Its chief director is referred to as '''The Shadowy Figure''' (voiced by [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create "Cloney Island". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be [[lactose intolerant]].

They all wear blue [[paramilitary]] uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the ''Episode Two'' they are seen wearing [[Puma AG|Pumas]] sneakers.

==Supporting characters==

===Clone High students===

* '''[[Julius Caesar]]''': Caesar is a good friend of JFK. He is shown to be one of the popular students at Clone High and is very friendly. He speaks in a very old aristocratic and theatrical manner. From one of the quotes on the 2003 MTV website he implies that he is in a relationship with Catherine: "By my troth, Catherine the Great, thou hast playéd with mine heart of stone, and yay, I hath returned but not my pyre" and the two are often seen together. He is also a fan of [[Laurence Olivier]]. He always wears a [[laurel wreath]] on his head. He appears to have an indifferent personality as shown in ''Litter Kills Literally'' as he nonchalantly ate popcorn at Poncey's funeral and did not appear to mourn about his death like the other characters nor did he get shocked after JFK had a mental breakdown at the funeral, instead he appeared to be entertained. His catchphraise was originally to be "[[veni, vidi, vici|Veni, vidi, booyah]]!". He is voiced by [[Neil Flynn]].
* '''[[Catherine the Great]]''': a blonde classmate who speaks with a [[Valley girl]] dialect. She is best friends with Cleopatra and is one of the popular students. She is implied to be in a relationship with Julius Caesar as they are often together. She has had sex with JFK in which he insults her as "Catherine the so-so". She is shown as being vain, promiscuous and somewhat stupid. She had pursued Gandhi when he was "GFK" (Gandhi with a JFK makeover) but lost interest after he returned to his normal self and went to Winter Prom with JFK alongside The Brontë Sisters and Joan of Arc. In the Series Finale, Catherine and the Brontë Sisters discovers JFK's feelings for Joan and leave them. She is voiced by [[Murray Miller]].
* '''[[Genghis Khan]]''': a friend of Abe and Gandhi. He appears as very friendly but [[mental retardation|mentally challenged]] as he is unable to carry out simple tasks that have been instructed upon him. He is also overweight, gluttonous and has a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]]. However, he is a skilled opera singer as shown when he sang ''[[Ave Maria]]'' at Poncey's funeral. He also wears an orange shirt with the line "Screw Tibet!" and a newspaper hat on his head. In his original character design, Genghis was shown as being somewhat of a video game nerd. He is voiced by [[Phil Lord]].
* '''[[Marie Antoinette]]''': a physically attractive waitress at the [[Grassy Knoll]]. She is also another one of popular students. She has large breasts which are the source of JFK and Gandhi's boob jokes which she appears to be annoyed by in ''A Room for One's Clone''. She speaks with a French accent despite the fact her clone-mother was Austrian. Her head got chopped off by Winston Churchill's helicopter in ''Makeover'' and she is seen carrying her head in her arms at the end of the episode ''Changes'' (but strangely enough she was previously seen with it attached to her neck when she was conversing with Tom Green in the background). She is voiced by [[Sarah Chalke]].
* '''[[George Washington Carver]]''': a science geek who is obsessed with experimenting with peanuts. He created Peanie, an anthropomorphic peanut. He and Gandhi make a [[blaxploitation]]-style film called ''Black and Tan'' in the episode ''Film Fest''. He is voiced by [[Donald Faison]].
* '''[[Jesus Christ|Jesús Cristo]]''': a [[Latino]] version of Jesus Christ. He is often seen in woodshop class, which is an allusion to the real Jesus' career as a [[carpenter]]. He was used as a confidant to Joan in ''A.D.D.: The Last 'D' is for Disorder''. He wears a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] on his head. He also appears to be a [[stoner (cannabis)|stoner]]. His voice is provided by [[Jeff Garcia (voice actor)|Jeff Garcia]].
* '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''': Appears in one scene in the episode "Film Fest: Tears of a Clone". He appears to have a peace sign on his armband instead of a [[swastika]].
* '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]''': a mentally disturbed and anti-social young man. He is missing his ear and covers the exposed area with a bandage. He may represent the [[emo (subculture)|emo]] kid. His room is modeled after the [[impressionist]] paintings of Van Gogh. Like his clone-father he is a very talented artist as shown when he painted a giant mural to get back at Gandhi. He is voiced by [[Andy Dick]].
* '''[[Marie Curie]]''': a clone who was morbidly deformed due to the exposure to radiation that was in her clone-mother's DNA. She has a very sweet, innocent and nice personality and is very active at school. She is the president of the Solid Gandhi Dancers. She has a major crush on Gandhi as revealed in the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover''. Gandhi acknowledges his feelings for her at the episode of ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover'' and they became a couple at the end of the episode ''Changes''. She is voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].
* '''[[Thomas Edison]]''': He is one of the school nerds and runs the [[audiovisual]] club. He has a [[hunchback]] and the way he speaks makes him sound [[nasal congestion|congested]] and having a [[lisp]]. He is voiced by Andy Dick.
* '''[[Paul Revere]]''': the nosy school [[gossip]] who he is seen riding a horse while he spreads rumors, he played a major role in the episode ''A.D.D'', as he informed the whole school of Gandhi's condition. He is voiced by [[Zach Braff]].
* '''[[Nostradamus]]''': He is an overweight, pimply nerd who falsely believes that he can predict anything, he is known for saying he knew something was going to happen after it already did happen. Because of that he is often seen as a nuisance. He is a lover of science fiction and fantasy. He was also seen hanging with [[Marilyn Monroe]] at the Grassy Knoll.
* '''The [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] Twins''': one twin is fit and healthy which represents the younger Elvis during his prime in the 1950s and the other twin is overweight and gluttonous with an addiction to [[tranquilizers]] to represent Elvis during his downfall in the 1970s.
* '''[[Isaac Newton]]''': He was originally supposed to be a recurring character, but only appeared in cameos. He is a [[skateboarder]] with very long curly hair and wears a baseball cap that covers his eyes.
* '''[[Buddy Holly]]''': He plays in a band called ''[[flight recorder|Black Box]]'' along with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] (who along with the real Holly, also died in plane crashes). He was originally supposed to a recurring character but only appeared in ''Plane Crazy'' in which he offers to let Abe ride in a poorly constructed [[biplane]] held together by duct tape along with Vaughan, Valens and half of ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn.
* '''[[Sigmund Freud]]''': He seems able to read people's subconsciences. He appears in ''Film Fest'' in which he is the only one who is able to see Joan's love for Abe in her film entry albeit he mocks her for it. According to an article JFK wrote for the school newspaper ''The Tatler'', he tells JFK that he was repressed because he had two father figures and no mother to subconsciously lust after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatler issue #3 |url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528053308/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |archivedate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]''': Member of Clone High Basketball Team and an assistant manager at T.G.I. Chili's [[Chain store#Restaurant chains|restaurant chain]] when Abe and Gandhi get after-school jobs. Abe notes that he has [[Napoleon complex|somekind of complex]].
* '''[[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]]''': referred to as "Poncey" is a combined parody of [[Fonzie]], [[Dylan McKay]] and [[James Dean]]. He only appears in the episode ''Litter Kills Literally'' alive but makes a cameo in the series finale as a ghost. He was JFK's best friend until they got into an argument. He was violently killed by a freak accident involving litter, where a juice box stabs him in the throat and a plastic bag gets caught on his head, causing him to drown in his own blood. (The juice box may be an allusion to the real Ponce de León's death, who died of a [[poison dart]].) He was very popular and well liked by the other students and he also appeared as optimistic and philosophical which JFK mocked about him. He makes another appearance in that episode as ghost but was likely that was only a hallucination conceived by the grief-stricken JFK. He was voiced by [[Luke Perry]].

===Clone High staff===

* '''[[Eleanor Roosevelt]]''': The school's gym teacher. She appears as grotesque and aggressive. She also implies she is a lesbian as she ogled at Joan in the episode ''Escape from Beer Mountain''.
* '''Mr. Sheepman''': A kindly history teacher at Clone High, home room teacher for the clones, and the first mostly human clone with a little sheep DNA mixed into his genetic composition (a parody of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the Sheep]]). His mannerisms are a parody of [[Don Knotts]]. Voice by [[Andy Dick]].

===Family===

* '''Abe's Foster Dad''' and '''Abe's Foster Mom''': They represent a typical conservative suburban couple. They are seen in ''Raisin the Stakes'' where they reprimand Abe for smoking raisins and Abe's father is seen in the episode ''Changes'' which he encourages Abe to have sex with Cleopatra. Abe's father resembles Harold Weir from the TV series [[Freaks and Geeks]]. Abe's Foster Dad is voiced by [[Joe Flaherty]] and Abe's Foster Mom is voiced by Will Forte.
* '''Toots''': Joan's adoptive grandfather. He is a blind, elderly, likely senile African-American [[jazz]] musician who resembles [[Ray Charles]]. He is seen with a [[clarinet]] most of the time. He has a very down-to-earth personality. He is loving and patient towards his foster granddaughter and gives her advice all the time but he fails to understand why she is so upset. He possible is a devout Christian as he has a golden [[Jesus Fish]] on the trunk of his car. He is in a relationship with Cleo's alcoholic mother. He is voiced by [[Donald Faison]].
* '''Wally and Carl''': JFK's adoptive fathers who he refers to as "Gay Foster Dads". They are a flamboyant, gay, interracial couple who are loving and understanding towards their adopted son despite his mild [[homophobia]]. JFK shows low tolerance for them and stresses himself to act as masculine and promiscuous as possible to compensate for their homosexuality. Wally is the African-American effeminate partner and Carl is the Caucasian [[butch and femme|butch]] partner. They are voiced by [[Donald Faison]] and [[Neil Flynn]] respectively.
* '''Cleo's drunk foster mom''': Cleo's (and formerly Gandhi's) unnamed adoptive mother. She is a lazy, slurring [[alcoholic]] being unemployed and lives off disability checks. She tends to be abusive towards her daughter both physically and verbally. She once threw make-up at Cleo when she ran out of [[liquor]]. Her hostility towards Cleo is stemmed from her own jealously as Cleo is everything she is not, being young, popular and attractive. She is in a relationship with Toots and the two are into [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] as it is seen in ''A Room For One's Clone''. It is likely her last name is Smith as that is Cleo's surname and it is said by Gandhi that she was married at one point because he said Cleo convinced her parents to disown him. She will proposition Abe at one point whenever he tries to visit or contact Cleo. She is voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].
* '''Gandhi's parents''': Gandhi's adopted mother and father are a [[Jewish stereotypes|stereotypical]] [[Jewish]] couple. They want Gandhi to excel in school. Gandhi's Stereotypical Jewish Foster Dad is voiced by Neil Flynn.

===Other characters===

* '''Narrator''': the sarcastic narrator of the show, he tells the audience in the beginning what happened in the previous episode and a preview of the succeeding episode at the end of the show. He is voiced by [[Will Forte]] who also voices Abe.
* '''Scangrade ("The Magnificent")''': an egotistical and boastful robot who is Mr. Butlertron's hated nemesis. He is a giant dated computer grading machine but with arms and legs and a face. Unlike Mr. Butlertron, Scangrade is very primitive as he was manufactured in the 1950s (he has to be plugged into the wall just to operate). He appears in ''Sleep of Faith'' and though Mr. Butlertron destroyed him at the end of that episode, Scangrade appears in ''Changes'' in which he is covered with tape as a repair. He is powered by the PXJTs. He refers to everyone as "infidels". He is voiced by [[Judah Miller]].
* '''President Dog''': A cute, little stray [[puppy]] who is the student body president of Clone High. He randomly appears at the end of the ''Episode Two'' in the heat of the class election between Abe Lincoln and JFK, all the students immediately but unintentionally voted him as their class president because of his cuteness and Cleopatra even tried to [[bestiality|seduce him]]. Cleo somewhat takes ownership of him and she constantly dotes on him. He was one of the reasons why JFK and Cleo broke up as JFK was annoyed by Cleo putting herself and the dog before him.
* '''Cop''': a police officer who makes random appearances in the series notably in episodes ''Escape from Beer Mountain'', ''Sleep of Faith'', ''Film Fest'' and ''Litter Kills Literally''. He is voiced by [[Andy Dick]].
* '''Peanie''': an anthropomorphic peanut with a monocle, eyes, arms and legs. He was created by George Washington Carver. He is kept in a jar and has a fear of being turned into peanut butter. He has appeared in episodes: ''Escape from Beer Mountain'' and ''Film Fest''. He is a parody of [[Mr. Peanut]].
* '''Geshy''': a strange, colorful and [[carnivorous]] creature that was introduced in the episode ''Shot in the D'arc''. He is the mascot for GESH (Genetically Engineered Superhuman High) and is kidnapped by Gandhi and Genghis to gain revenge on GESH. It is revealed that he is a real creature and he and Gandhi form a friendship similar to [[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial|Elliot and E.T.]]. After Gandhi gives him up it is shown he has an insatiable appetite for flesh and begins eating wild animals and bit off the referee's arm. He makes a cameo appearance in ''Litter Kills Literally'' hidden among a group of animals that JFK calls to clean up litter.
* '''Glenn the Janitor''': Is the janitor who works at Clone High. He is also the adopted father of Ponce de León. His appearance is based on the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] from the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (which is also produced by Bill Lawrence). In connection to ''Clone High'', in a [[Scrubs (season 8)|season 8]] episode of ''Scrubs'' it was revealed that the Janitor's real name was ''Glenn Matthews''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn, who was famous for playing the Janitor on ''Scrubs''.

==Reception==
''Clone High'' is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the [[LA Times]] wrote that, "Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"/&gt;

'''Luděk Alois Marold''' (7 August 1865, [[Prague]] – 1 December 1898, Prague) was a Czech painter and illustrator, best known for his panorama depicting the [[Battle of Lipany]]. It is the largest painting in the Czech Republic and currently has its own pavilion at the [[Výstaviště Praha|Výstaviště]] exhibition grounds.

== Biography ==
[[File:Ludek Marold Maler im Atelier.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Artist in His Studio (1892)]]
He was born out of wedlock and given his mother's surname. His father, an Army Lieutenant, was killed the following year during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and his mother died six years later. The next nine years of his life are largely undocumented, although he apparently tried to enter Cadet School, but failed the examinations.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rodon.cz/zivotopisy-umelcu/Marold-Ludek-73  Brief biography] @ Rodon.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of sixteen, he entered the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague|Academy of Fine Arts]], but remained for only a year and was expelled. 

His studies did not resume until 1881, when he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where his instructors were [[Ludwig von Löfftz]] and [[Nikolaos Gysis]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|6|106|107|Marold Luděk|V. Kratinová}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he exchanged ideas with other Czech painters such as [[Mikoláš Aleš]] and [[Alfons Mucha]]. His first professional successes came as an illustrator for several German and Czech magazines, such as ''[[Světozor]]''.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

During this time, he began to suffer from [[rheumatic fever]] so, in 1887, he returned to Prague,&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; where he worked in the studios of [[Maximilian Pirner]]&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; and edited publications from the newly established [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]], headed by his old friend Aleš. Two years later, he received a state scholarship to study in Paris, where he found a position in the studios of [[Pierre-Victor Galland]]. In 1891, he was married. The following year, after Galland's death, he gave up his scholarship to become a freelance artist.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He continued to create illustrations for periodicals and books by Czech authors and received a gold medal at an exhibition in Munich in 1892. Later, he adopted the [[Art Nouveau]] style and began receiving orders for posters. In 1895, he was elected a member of the "{{ill|Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences|cs|Česká akademie věd a umění}}".

By 1897, he was back in Prague, where he proposed creating a gigantic panorama of the Battle of Lipany for an upcoming exhibition. His proposal was accepted and, after making sketches at the battlefield, he began work in early 1898. He collaborated with Karel Raška (1861-1918), the landscape painter [[Václav Jansa]], colorist  Theodor Hilšer (1866-1930) and the animal painter {{ill|Ludvík Vacátko|cs}}. It measures 11 meters (36 feet) high and 95 meters (311 feet) long. The stress of completing this huge work on schedule had a fatal effect on his already fragile health and he died shortly after it went on display in 1898. A major retrospective of his work was held the following year.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Three streets in have been named after him; in [[Děčín]], [[Kladno]] and Prague.

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Mondaufgang am Meer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''Moonrise over the Sea'' (''Mondaufgang am Meer''), 1822. {{convert|55|xx|71|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin]]

'''''Moonrise by the Sea''''' or '''''Moonrise over the Sea''''' (German: ''Mondaufgang am Meer'') is an 1822 oil-on-canvas painting by German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].  The work depicts a [[Romanticism|romantic]] seascape.  

Three young people, two women side by side and a man further back, are sitting on a large boulder by the sea, silhouetted against the sky as they watch the moon rising to the east above a band of clouds.  In the distance are two sailing vessels, ghosting on a light breeze towards the spectators on the shore.  The painting is probably a view of the [[Baltic Sea]], near Friedrich's birthplace in [[Swedish Pomerania]].  It may be based on the beach at [[Stubbenkammer]] near [[Rügen]].

The work was commissioned by banker and art collector [[Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener]], together with a second work, ''[[The Lonely Tree]]'' (''Der einsame Baum''), to create a pair of "times of the day", depicting morning and evening landscape scenes, in a tradition of [[Claude Lorrain]].  It was completed before November 1822 and has been held by the [[Berlin National Gallery]] since 1861, donated by Wagener as part of its founding collection.  It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] of the [[Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin.

A similarly named but much larger painting from 1821 has been held by the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg since 1928, and was formerly in the {{ill|Ropsha Palace|de|Ropscha-Palast|fr|Palais de Ropcha}}, and had been hung in the drawing room of [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]; it measures {{convert|137|xx|170|cm}}.

Evolving Definition : : '''Morphology''' in [[architecture]] is the study of the evolution of form within the built environment. Often specifically reducible to the interaction of people and the material world, this in fact broad concept references linguistics, history, sociology, physics, and biology to describe changes in the formal syntax of buildings and cities as their relationship to people and individuals evolves and changes.  Often morphology describes discursive processes, such as in the evolution of a design concept from first conception to production, but can also be understood as the categorical study in the change of buildings and their use from a historical perspective.  Similar to genres of music, morphology concretizes 'movements' and arrives at definitions of architectural 'styles' or typologies.  Architectural typologies are often described by the movements that gave rise to a certain aesthetic, the influences of which are usually cultural or philosophical in origin. Some examples are, [[Indigenous Architecture|indigenous architecture]], [[Classical Architecture|classical architecture]], [[baroque architecture]], [[modernism]], [[postmodernism]], [[deconstructionism]], [[brutalism]], and [[futurism]].  Recent advances in fluid and cross platform tools such as [[3d printing]], [[virtual reality]], and [[building information modeling]] make the current contemporary typology formally difficult to pinpoint into one holistic definition. Advances in the study of Architectural (formal) morphology have the potential to influence or foster new fields of study in the realms of the arts, cognitive science, psychology, behavioral science, neurology, mapping, linguistics, and other as yet unknown social spatial practices or studies. Often Architectural Morphologies are reflexive or indicative of political influences of their time and perhaps more importantly, place.

'''Motion graphic design''' is a subset of [[graphic design]] in that it uses graphic design principles in a [[filmmaking]] or [[video production]] context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of [[animation]] or [[Film techniques|filmic techniques]]. Examples include the [[kinetic typography]] and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional [[station identification]] logos of some [[television channel]]s. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.

A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from [[film]]making or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. 

Popular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.

==Technology==
Technological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as [[computer program]]s for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.

One of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been [[Adobe After Effects]], which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is [[Apple Inc.]] [[Motion (software)|Motion]], now a part of [[Final Cut Studio]]. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.

[[Adobe Flash]] has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in [[web design]], but also in some animation products, such as animated [[web television]] productions like [[Homestar Runner]].

'''Music without sound''' can refer to music that falls outside the range of human hearing (typically 20&amp;nbsp;Hz–20&amp;nbsp;kHz) or to compositions, such as [[visual music]], that are analogous to or suggestive of conventional music but in media other than sound, such as color, shape, position, motion and literature (see Discursive music below). It is commonly taken for granted that music is wont to be performed or recorded, but some sound works simply won't fit on a disc or on stage, being either extremely discreet (like Robin Minard's ''Silent Music'') or incomplete (Varèse's Unfinished music). Additionally, silence can be regarded as the [[via negativa]] of music and has induced long lasting fascination to music composers of all kinds. A composer deals with the absence of sound as much as they deal with sounds. Therefore, this article includes several examples of [[apophasis]] in music (like Algorithmic music or Gesture Music). 
{{cquote|''"It seems to me that the most radical redefinition of music would be one that defines 'music' without reference to sound."''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Ashley]], 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nyman, ''Experimental Music'', 1974, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gesture music==
'''Sofia Gubaidulina'''&lt;br /&gt;
Silence in music happens when the music stops during a performance. It is sometimes replaced by gesture music. In his Sofia Gubaidulina biography,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 184, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kurtz mentions the ''silent solo performance by the conductor'' included in ''...Stimmenn... verstummen...'', an orchestral work from 1986.
{{cquote|''The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This "conductor solo" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.''&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia [[Stimmen Verstummen|...Stimmenn... verstummen...]] article}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Knizak-snowstorm.jpg|right|thumb|Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1]] --&gt;
'''Milan Knizak'''&lt;br /&gt;
From 1960, the International [[Fluxus]] Movement created a number of Events or Verbal Pieces, whose temporal structures were typically vague so as to be sometimes without beginning nor end, with or without sound, with or without music. A remarkable example is that of Czech artist Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1 whose score states: ''Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience.''
{{cquote|''Another Event, by Czech Fluxus artist Milan Knizak, is called Snowstorm N°1 (1965) and simply instructs that ‘Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience’. What results is a snowstorm of quietly gliding paper airplanes as the audience returns them back and forth and so on. The exchange of sheets is experimentaly beautiful, like the caring gesture toward the instrument as tended by Brecht.''&lt;br /&gt;[From ''Not the Other Avant-garde''].&lt;ref&gt;James Martin Harding and John Rouse (editors) ''Not the Other Avant-Garde: The Transnational Foundations of Avant-Garde Performance'', University of Michigan Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-472-06931-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-06931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;br /&gt;'''Helmut Lachenmann'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Lachenmann]] composed ''Salut Für Caldwell'' for 2 guitars in 1977. The piece includes silent moments when ''« the players silent motions and gestures created a space of unheard music »''
[Michael Kurtz&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 192, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;]

&lt;br /&gt;'''Takehisa Kosugi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1963 [[Takehisa Kosugi]] composed for ''Fluxus 1'' a musical piece called ''Theatre Music'' in the form of a rectangle of cardstock that bore the trace of a spiral of moving feet. This was paired with the instructions: "Keep walking intently".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mereweather ed., ''Art Anti-Art Non-Art'', Getty Research Institute, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;'''Juan María Solare'''&lt;br /&gt;
* His work ''[[Gestenstücke]]'' (2008) is a collection of five pieces for 4 performers in which a musical structure is used to put order in non-sounding elements, concretely gestures. For instance, the first piece of the cycle is a canon of gestures. Premiere: University Bremen, Ensemble Neues Musiktheater, June 12, 2008.
* Another non-sounding piece is his conceptual work called ''Tense Atmosphere'' a graphic score which consists of a silence with a sforzato sign (2013).

== Algorithmic music ==
[[File:Stadler -579180303.jpg|right|thumb|Maximilian Stadler (1748-1833)]]
''A sequence of finite instructions'' according to Wikipedia, an [[algorithm]] relates to computation, which ultimately relates to music. Eighteenth century algorithmic music is a contemporary of [[automaton]] machines, like [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s duck or [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]'s chess player, or [[Ada Lovelace]] and [[Charles Babbage]]'s 1822 difference engine. In 1787, [[W.A. Mozart]] (1756–1791) devised an aleatoric system called ''[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]'' (''Musical Dice'')&lt;ref&gt;Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice Game), K.516f in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart’s music&lt;/ref&gt; published 1793 by J.J. Hummel in Berlin-Amsterdam, to compose waltzes with a pair of dice and a set of written bars on paper cards.&lt;ref&gt;See Hideo Noguchi's [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rb5h-ngc/e/k516f.htm article]: ''Mozart Musical Game in C K. 516f'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of all the 16 cards and transitions, of which there are theoretically &lt;math&gt;10^{29}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, constitutes a minuet.&lt;ref&gt;Computation from John Chuang in a 1995 [http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/ article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian composer Maximilian Johann Karl Dominik Stadler, also known as [[Maximilian Stadler]] (1748–1833), created a table to compose [[minuet]]s and trios with a pair of dice. In the case of the minuet version, there are 16 cards with one bar each and preconceived transitions between certain musical measures. Mathematical games columnist Martin Gardner once remarked in an article about automated music composition. ''"If you fail to preserve it, it will be a waltz that will probably never be heard again."''&lt;ref&gt;See Ivars Peterson's [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/1956/title/Mozarts_Melody_Machine article] ''Mozart's Melody Machine'' on Science News&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of pure [[aleatoric music]] was used in the twentieth century by US composer [[Lejaren Hiller]].

== The optophonic piano&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Opto-disc.jpg|right|thumb| Optophonic disc, paint on glass, diameter: 40cms, ca. 1920-24]] --&gt; ==
[[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné]]&lt;ref&gt;See Baranoff-Rossiné's official web [http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627175122/http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started building his [[optophonic piano]] in the 1915s. A set of painted glass discs are rotated via the small keyboard. Light is projected through the discs onto the wall. The player can control intensity of light and speed of rotation. 6 or 8 keys of the 3-octaves keyboard are devoted to colored discs. It is not clear what kind of sound the keyboard is able to produce. Oscillator frequencies (as stated in some articles) are rather unlikely between 1915-1920. More probably the light show was performed with piano accompaniment, maybe performed on the reduced keyboard of the Optosonic Piano, akin to a toy piano.

== Unfinished/aborted music ==
At one point, the music exists in the composer's mind. In 1928, [[Edgar Varèse]] started working on an opera called ''L'Astronome'' based on North American Indian legends, a project he never completed and destroyed the drafts. In 1932, he asked [[Antonin Artaud]] to write the libretto of a large scale oratorio, ''Il n'ya plus de firmament'' (There is no longer any firmament). In his book ''Phantasmatic Radio'' '''Allen S. Weiss''' translates the beginning of Artaud's text:
{{cquote|''Darkness. Explosions in this darkness. Harmonies suddenly broken off. Harsh sounds. Depressurized soundings. The music will give the impression of a distant cataclysm and will fill the room, falling as from vertiginous heights. Chords will originate in the sky and then deteriorate, going from one extreme to the other. Sounds will fall as if from very high, then suddenly stop and spread out in bursts, forming vaults and parasols. Tiers of sounds...'' [in ''Phantasmatic Radio''&lt;ref&gt;Allen S. Weiss, ''Phantasmatic Radio'', Duke University Press, 1995, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;]}}
The piece was never completed and Varèse turned to other projects, including a radiophonic work involving various synchronised choirs located in different places of the world. He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his ''Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu'' (To have done with the judgment of God). This was done in the Radiodiffusion Television Française studios where [[Pierre Schaeffer]] was working at the time.

== Silent music ==
''Silent Music'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Schulz (editor) ''Silent Music - zwischen Klangkunst und Akustikdesign/Between Sound Art and Acoustic Design'', book+CD, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is an installation work by Canadian artist [[Robin Minard]] (b1953) with several hundred wall-mounted piezo loudspeakers and four-channel audio. The miniature loudspeakers are displayed in plant-like shapes on the walls of public spaces. They reproduce the minuscule ambient sounds of the public space where they are installed or play random synthetic sounds at barely audible volume. Minard deals with remote sounds best suited to intimate listening. In 2006 he created 'A voir en silence', a small artist book with loudspeakers and hand-written text.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Meinhardt ''Silent Music/Adelaide Festival'' DVD, Australia, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discursive music ==
'''Marcel Proust'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Vinteuil Sonata]] (French: [[:fr:Sonate de Vinteuil|''Sonate de Vinteuil'']]) is an imaginary violin and piano sonata by fictitious composer Vinteuil recurring several times in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''), particularly in ''[[Un amour de Swann|Un Amour De Swann]]'' (1913). In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]] noticed how much Marcel Proust ''"vivait la musique de son temps"'' (experienced contemporary music).&lt;ref&gt;See Adrien De Vries' [http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205112508/http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 |date=2008-12-05 }}: ''Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil'', April 2007 (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed [[Debussy]]'s 1902 ''[[Pelléas_et_Mélisande_(opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande ]]'' opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the Sonata. Possibly [[Gabriel Fauré]]&lt;ref&gt;See Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's [http://www.french.pomona.edu/MSAIGAL/CLASSES/FR185/FALL96/aaldoory-mhunter/ article]: ''L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or [[César Franck]]. In [[:fr:Les Plaisirs et les Jours|Les Plaisirs et les Jours]] (1896), Proust focusses on [[Hans Sachs]]'s monologue from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', Act II. In ''[[Jean Santeuil]]'' (1952), a [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] Sonata for Violin and Piano (op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In ''Un Amour De Swann'', the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences. 

'''Walter Marchetti'''
&lt;br /&gt;A good example of imaginary music can be found in a Walter Marchetti poem where he mentions a Juan Hidalgo imaginary composition (both Hidalgo and Marchetti were members of the Spanish [[Zaj]] Group of Madrid in the late 1950s).
{{cquote|''Eat an iced popsicle and thus perform his free''&lt;br /&gt;''transcription, for only one performer, of''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Music For Five Dogs, an iced'''''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Popsicle and Six Male Performers'''''&lt;br /&gt;''by Juan Hidalgo.''&lt;br /&gt;Walter Marchetti in ''A Zaj Sampler''&lt;ref&gt;Something Else Press, New York, 1967, reissued by Great Bear Pamphlets&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mythos''''' is a three-part documentary that consists of a series of lectures given by [[Joseph Campbell]]. Campbell conceived of the original lectures, filmed over the last six years of his life, as a summation of what he had learned about the human mythic impulse, in terms of [[psychology]], [[ethnology]] and [[comparative mythology]]—what he called "the one great story of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&amp;p9999_action=details&amp;p9999_wid=258 ''Mythos''] page on [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformations: A False Step==
After Campbell's death and the posthumous celebrity brought by the airing in 1988 of ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', the filmmakers who had recorded the lectures quickly cobbled together a much-abridged, hastily edited series for [[PBS]] entitled ''Transformations of Myth Through Time''. An even-more-highly redacted version was briefly released under the title ''The World of Joseph Campbell''.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time"&gt;[https://www.jcf.org/works/help/faq/from-transformations-of-myth-through-time-to-mythos/ The Transformations of Myth Through Time] and Mythos: from [http://www.jcf.org JCF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mythos'' Emerges==
Campbell's estate, represented by his widow [[Jean Erdman]] and, eventually, by the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]] (JCF), asked that these versions, which were unlicensed and did not accurately represent Campbell's thoughts, be pulled from the market, and proposed the production of a twenty-hour television series in four parts that followed Campbell's original vision more closely: ''Mythos''.

Volume One of ''Mythos'' was released in 1999. Volume Two was released in 2000. Both parts are narrated by [[Susan Sarandon]].

After these initial releases, the original distributor, Unipix, promptly went bankrupt, and production on the series halted.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt;

The JCF re-released the first two volumes in 2007 and 2008 in conjunction with [[Acorn Media]] as part of the ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series and the third volume was released in 2011. The decision was eventually made that the planned fourth volume, dealing with James Joyce's novels, was to be released in 2013 as a separate product.&lt;ref name="The Transformations of Myth Through Time" /&gt; This was motivated by the difficulties to make its contents fit with the overall format of ''Mythos''.

The three volumes of ''Mythos'' were released together as ''Mythos - The Complete Series'' in September 2012.

'''The New York Center for Independent Publishing''' is located on New York's "Literary Row" at 20 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Formerly the Small Press Center, the Center was founded by Whitney North Seymour, Jr. in 1984.  The Center's historical seedbed as the home of independent publishing dates back to 1831, when [[James Harper (publisher)|James Harper]], one of the original four Harper Brothers, joined as a member of the [[General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York]], which has housed the Center since its inception. Other early printer and publisher members include [[John Bishop Putnam]], James J. Little and Benjamin Collins.

The Center provides access to education and expertise in the field of independent publishing, networking opportunities, workshops, teleseminars, lectures, its annual small press book fair and exhibits. The Center also houses [[The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts]], a comprehensive collection of books (many rare and out of print) and other materials on the bookselling and publishing industries. 

The Center's annual signature programs include: the Independent and Small Press Book Fair; National Small Press Month, and its host of reading marathons, lectures, and publishing workshops; the New York Round Table Writers’ Conference; and the series, Emerging Voices: Writers Published by Groundbreaking Independent Presses. In addition to such public programs, each year the Center awards the coveted Poor Richard Award to an independent Publisher who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of independent publishing. Past recipients include: [[Barney Rosset]], [[André Schiffrin]], Peter Workman, Esther Margolis and Bill Henderson.  

The Center is an educational program of the [[General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York]], located at 20 West 44th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues in midtown Manhattan.

== What ''type'' of thing is literature? ==
Literature can be described as all of the following:

* [[Communication]] &amp;ndash; activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
** [[Written communication]] (writing) &amp;ndash; representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Daniels, "The Study of Writing Systems", in ''The World's Writing Systems'', ed. Bright and Daniels, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subdivision of [[culture]] &amp;ndash; shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-arts the arts]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taipei 101 14, Dec 06.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Page One book retailer outlet at [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan.]]

'''Page One''' ({{zh|s=叶壹堂|p=Yèyī Táng}}) is a [[bookstore]] chain and publisher founded in [[Singapore]] by Mark Tan (陈家强), with locations in Singapore, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]].  Traditionally focused on English language books, it has recently expanded into the Chinese language market. However the shops have been closed in Singapore in 2011, Taiwan in 2015 and Hong Kong in November, 2016.

==History==
Page One began in 1983, when a small shop stocking handpicked art and design books opened in a shopping mall in Singapore. The small shop accumulated a loyal following over the years and evolved into a brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pageonegroup.com/|title=Page One Group|last=|first=|date=|website=Page One|publisher=Page One Group|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Page One has marked its presence with bookstores in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Singapore, the Page One bookstore is established at [[VivoCity]], the shopping mall touted to be the largest of its kind on the island.

While it began as a retail outfit, Page One has also expanded in the areas of book publishing and distribution over the years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In publishing, Page One builds its strength from the acquisition of rights and creation of original in-house titles, with a focus on art and design content. Page One Publishing also brought its created titles to the West by selling territorial rights. These titles have been translated into eleven different languages. As a distributor, Page One has established a strong network in Asia and the rest of the world.

==Controversies==  
The chain managed to obtain approval for opening outlets in mainland China in early 2010s, and started reducing the number of political books stocked. No books deemed to be on sensitive topics are sold inside the country, except Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/hong-kong-bookshops-pull-politically-sensitive-titles-after-publishers-vanish|title=Hong Kong bookshops pull politically sensitive titles after publishers vanish|author=Ilaria Maria Sala|work=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances|disappearance of five people]] linked to an independent Hong Kong book publishing house, the chain removed these books from their store at Hong Kong airport. The company will stop selling these titles in Hong Kong once existing stocks have been exhausted, leading to criticisms from academics that this forced disappearance from bookshop shelves as a result of the case was blatant self-censorship.&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull/&gt;

==Design==
Mark Tan and his brother, architect Kay Ngee Tan ({{zh|s=陈家毅}}), uniquely incorporated Southeast Asian art into their stores.  For instance in [[Taipei]], Vietnamese, Burmese and Thai etc., artworks were specially designed for the store, which customers could also purchase.

Southeast Asian clothworks decorate Page One stores and the decor is changed every season.  This design initiative brought about the rise of "giant"-sized bookstores in Asia.

==History==
[[File:Place Royale (Koningsplein), Brussels, Belgium (ca. 1890-1900).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Place Royale, late 19th century]]

The square itself is built on the former site of the Baliënplein, which was the main market square adjacent to the former [[Coudenberg|palace of Coudenberg]]. The palace burned down, however, during a fire that took much of the original royal complex on the night of February 3, 1731. Construction of the new buildings around the square took from 1773 to 1780, using the design of French architect [[Gilles-Barnabé Guimard|Barnabé Guimard]], who received that commission in 1769. The square is almost an exact replica of the Place Royale in [[Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, B: ''Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture'', p. 821. Architectural Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, a [[barricade]] was erected across the eastern exit of the square next to the current BELvue Museum, facing the [[Brussels Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'attaque du Parc de Bruxelles par les Volontaires en 1830|url=http://www.b1830.be/voluntary/doc.html|publisher=B1830.be|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cannon were also positioned on it.

In 1831, the coronation of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], Belgium's first king, was held in the place. The funerals of [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] and [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders|Prince Charles]], prince-regent between 1944 and 50, were also held in the square.

In 2014, the heritage organization [[Beliris]] announced plans to restore the buildings and atmosphere on the square. Final plans will be provided in 2016 and work may begin in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laporte|first1=Christian|title=Une place encore plus… royale|url=http://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/une-place-encore-plus-royale-5472590d35707d02ac19d6ba|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]]|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal building on the square is the [[Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg]], consecrated in 1787, and designed by Barré and [[Gilles-Barnabé Guimard|Guimard]]. On the western side of the square is the main building of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], next to the [[Magritte Museum]] while on the south-east side is the [[BELvue Museum]]. At the center of Place Royale is a statue of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], the leader of the [[First Crusade|first crusade]] in 1096, riding on horseback. It was sculpted by [[Eugène Simonis]] in 1848 to replace the statue of [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine]] that had been melted down for the metal during the [[French Revolution]]. Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat enters the square from the south, rue de la Régence/Regentschapstraat from the southwest, and [[Mont des Arts]] from the northwest.

== Accessibility ==
This square is located near the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] stations [[Brussels Central Station|Gare Centrale/Centraal Station]], [[Parc metro station (Brussels)|Parc/Park]] and [[Trône/Troon metro station|Trône/Troon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">'''Post-conceptual''', '''Postconceptual''', '''Post-conceptualism''' or '''Postconceptualism''' is an [[art theory]] that builds upon the legacy of [[conceptual art]] in [[contemporary art]], where the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work takes some precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into art school parlance through the influence of [[John Baldessari]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the early 1970s. The writer eldritch Priest, specifically ties John Baldessari's piece ''Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)'' from 1973 (in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the best out of 36 tries, with 36 being the determining number as that is the standard number of shots on a roll of [[35mm film]]) as an early example of post-conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;eldritch Priest, ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often connected to [[generative art]] and [[digital art]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-conceptualism as an art practice has also been connected to the work of [[Robert C. Morgan]], specifically his ''Turkish Bath'' installation at [[Artists Space]] in 1976, and in Morgan's writing in ''Between Modernism and Conceptual Art: A Critical Response '' from 1997. It has been connected to the work of [[Robert Smithson]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 99-116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piero Manzoni]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred Mohr]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/3908524 "Interview with Joseph Nechvatal, post-conceptual digital artist, composer and art theoretician"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lygia Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Annette Lemieux]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Matt Mullican]], and  the [[intermedia]] concept employed in the mid-sixties by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==As specific condition==
Conceptual Art focused attention on the idea behind the art object and questioned the traditional role of that object as the conveyor of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists "de-materialized" the art object and began to produce time-based and [[ephemeral]] artworks. Although total [[dematerialization (art)|dematerialization of the art object]] never occurred, the [[art object]] became flexible – [[malleable]] – and that malleability, coupled with [[semiotics]] and [[computer process]]ing, has resulted in the '''post-conceptual art object'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticpropaganda.co.uk/catalogues/Plastic_Propaganda_Post_Conceptual_Art_Practice_Part_Two.pdf] Post-Conceptual Art Practice: New Directions&lt;/ref&gt;

==As general condition==
Conceptual Art at the end of the 20th Century spread to become a general tendency, a resonance within art practice that became nearly ubiquitous. Thus the widespread use of the term “post-conceptual” as a prefix to painting such as that of [[Gerhard Richter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://oro.open.ac.uk/21890/] Gaiger, Jason (2004). Post conceptual painting: Gerhard Richter's Extended Leave-taking in themes in contemporary art. In: Perry, Gillian and Wood, Paul eds. Themes in Contemporary Art. London: Yale University Press, pp. 89–135&lt;/ref&gt; and photography such as that of [[Andreas Gursky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/one-and-three-ideas-conceptualism-before-during-and-after-conceptual-art/|title=One and Three Ideas: Conceptualism Before, During, and After Conceptual Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh|Benjamin Buchloh]] in ''Art After Conceptual Art'' points out that post-conceptual art is already emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the photo-based [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation art]] of [[Martha Rosler]], [[Louise Lawler]],  [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] makes the point that "post-conceptual art is not the name for a particular type of art so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general...."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne first noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">The '''Power Institute of Fine Arts''' is a teaching and research department, encompassing the fields of art history and theory, within the [[University of Sydney]]. 

==Background==
Founded in 1968, the institute was established out of a bequest from the expatriate Australian abstract artist John Wardell Power. The bequest provided for the establishment of a teaching department, a research library, and a gallery for contemporary exhibitions. &lt;ref name=UofS&gt;{{cite web|title=THE POWER INSTITUTE FOUNDATION FOR ART AND VISUAL CULTURE|url=http://sydney.edu.au/arts/power/about/index.shtml|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==John Wardell Power==
[[John Joseph Wardell Power|John Wardell Power]] is the man who established the legacy of the teaching department which turned into the Power Institute of Fine Arts. He was born in the year of 1881 in the city of Sydney, Australia. He died in the year of 1943 in Jersey, Channel Islands. During his childhood, his mother was always encouraging him to continue with his art. In the year of 1905, John Power had graduated from the University of Sydney with Bachelor of Medicine. After his education, he went to London to continue with his medical studies. During the First World War, Power gained the rank of Captain when he served as a physician in the British Army. After he gave up the medical field, he enrolled as an art student in Paris. &lt;ref name=UofS&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has been especially active in developing and promoting the study of [[Visual arts of Australia|Australian art]]. Scholars associated with the Power Institute include [[Donald Brook]], [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]], [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]], [[Virginia Spate]] and [[Roger Benjamin]].

The details of ResultSource's business are private and few in the publishing industry will speak openly about it.&lt;ref name=bercovici/&gt; "It's no wonder few people in the industry want to talk about bestseller campaigns. Put bluntly, they allow people with enough money, contacts, and know-how to buy their way onto bestseller lists."&lt;ref name=bercovici/&gt; However some information has come to light. In 2014, the ''Los Angeles Times'' published a story titled "Can bestseller lists be bought?"&lt;ref name=kellogg2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-pastor-contract-resultsource-bestseller-lists-20140305,0,7039368.story#axzz2vCwCm0fo |title=Can bestseller lists be bought?  |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Carolyn Kellogg |date=March 6, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhpbooks.com/got-200000-congratulations-youre-a-bestselling-author/ |title=Got $200,000?

The contract was for ResultSource "to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, 'Real Marriage' on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place 'Real Marriage' on the New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How-to list." To achieve this, the contract stated that "RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week." This took place and as a result, the book was successfully ranked #1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.&lt;ref name=kellogg2014/&gt; Driscoll later published an apology letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Driscoll Posts an Open Letter of Apology|url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/church/mark-driscoll-posts-open-letter-apology|website=Relevant Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">The '''Schulze Registers''' are the only surviving record of clandestine marriages in [[Ireland]].

Canon law in the 18th and 19th centuries in Ireland stipulated that [[banns]] should be called or a [[marriage licence]] obtained before a marriage could take place and that the marriage should be celebrated in the parish where at least one of the parties was resident. Also, the marriage had to be celebrated by a clergyman of one of the religious denominations then in Ireland.

Some clergymen were willing, for a fee, to marry couples in secret, in "irregular" or "clandestine" marriages. This might have been necessary for a number of reasons, for example, objections of parents, problems with religious affiliation, or financial difficulty. While most of these "couple-beggars" did not keep a record of the marriages, some did—among them J.G.F. Schulze (died February 1839), minister of the Lutheran Church in Poolbeg Street, [[Dublin]].  He was licensed to act only in his own congregation, but is known to have married couples of all sects, recording over 6,000 marriages between 1806 and 1837. Two of his registers of marriage survive, and are held by the [[Register office#Ireland|General Register Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groireland.ie/history3.htm General Register Office, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;
The marriages performed by Schulze, over 6000, have also been indexed in a book 'Irregular Marriages in Dublin before 1837' by Henry (Harry) McDowell (2015).

'''''Solomon Worshipping Idols''''' is a 1647 painting by [[Jacques Stella]], inspired by his trip to Italy and influenced by his meeting with [[Nicolas Poussin]] on the journey. It and its pair ''[[Solomon Receiving the Queen of Sheba]]'' are both now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

'''Stuckism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌ|k|ɪ|z|əm}}) is an international [[art movement]] founded in 1999 by [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] to promote [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] as opposed to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/stuckism "Glossary: Stuckism"], ''[[Tate]]''.

Childish and Thomson have issued several manifestos. The first one was ''The Stuckists'', consisting of 20 points starting with "Stuckism is a quest for [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]".&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/stuckistmanifesto.html The Stuckists manifesto], stuckism.com.

After exhibiting in small galleries in [[Shoreditch]], London, the Stuckists' first show in a major public museum was held in 2004 at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. The group has demonstrated annually at [[Tate Britain]] against the [[Turner Prize]] since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the [[Charles Saatchi]]-patronised [[Young British Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/movements/stuckism Stuckism], Artist Biographies website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8834871/The-Turner-Prizes-most-controversial-moments.html The Turner Prize's most controversial moments], 20 October 2011, The Telegraph website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although painting is the dominant artistic form of Stuckism, artists using other media such as photography, sculpture, film and [[collage]] have also joined, and share the Stuckist opposition to conceptualism and "ego-art."&lt;ref name=robertjanas&gt;"Stuckism International: The Stuckist Decade 1999–2009", [[Robert Janás]], [http://www.victoriapress.co.uk/ Victoria Press], 2009, a: p.73 - b: p.64, {{ISBN|0-907165-28-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Stuckism" was coined in January 1999 by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] in response to a poem read to him several times by [[Billy Childish]]. In it, Childish recites that his former girlfriend, [[Tracey Emin]] had said he was "stuck! stuck! stuck!" with his art, poetry and music.&lt;ref name=milner7&gt;[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Thomson, Charles]] (August 2004), "A Stuckist on Stuckism: Stella Vine", from: Ed.

There were eleven other founding members: [[Philip Absolon]], Frances Castle, Sheila Clark, [[Eamon Everall]], [[Ella Guru]], [[Wolf Howard]], [[Bill Lewis]], Sanchia Lewis, [[Joe Machine]], [[Sexton Ming]], and [[Charles Williams (artist)|Charles Williams]].&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The membership has evolved since its founding through creative collaborations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/info.html "Stuckism: Introduction"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the group was originally promoted as working in paint, but members have since worked in various other media, including poetry, fiction, performance, photography, film and music.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming were members of [[The Medway Poets]] performance group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; In 1982, [[Television South|TVS]] broadcast a documentary on the poets.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Group members published dozens of works.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record ''The Medway Poets'' LP.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Thomson got to know Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend was a friend of Emin; Thomson also met Everall.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

==Manifestos==
[[Image:2000 Real Turner Prize Show.jpg|thumb|left|The first Stuckists group of 13 artists at the ''Real Turner Prize Show'', Pure Gallery, Shoreditch, London, in October 2000]]

In August 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote ''The Stuckists [[manifesto]]''&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest/&gt; which stress the value of painting as a medium, its use for communication, and the expression of emotion and experience – as opposed to what Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, nihilism and irony of conceptual art and [[postmodernism]]. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: "Artists who don't paint aren't artists".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/stuckists-scourge-of-britart-put-on-their-own-exhibition-413009.html Stuckists, scourge of BritArt, put on their own exhibition] Sarah Cassidy, ''[[The Independent]]'', 23 August 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and third manifestos, ''An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota'' and ''[[Remodernism]]'' respectively, were sent to the director of the [[Tate]], [[Nicholas Serota]]. He sent a brief reply: "Thank you for your open letter dated 6&amp;nbsp;March. You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/serotareply.html "An open letter to Sir Nicholas Serota"], stuckism.com, 1999. Retrieved 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Remodernism'' manifesto, the Stuckists declared that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, a period of renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included ''Handy Hints'', ''Anti-anti-art'', ''The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing'', ''The Turner Prize'', ''The Decreptitude of the Critic'' and ''Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst''.

In ''Anti-anti-art'', the Stuckists outlined their opposition to what is known as "[[anti-art]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/StuckistAntiAntiArt.html |title=Anti-Anti-Art |publisher=Stuckism.com |date=2000-11-04 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuckists claim that [[conceptual art]] is justified by the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], but that Duchamp's work is "anti-art by intent and effect". The Stuckists feel that "Duchamp's work was a protest against the stale, unthinking artistic establishment of his day", while "the great (but wholly unintentional) irony of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]] is that it is a direct equivalent of the conformist, unoriginal establishment that Duchamp attacked in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/asullivan/stuckism.html |title=Stuckism : Art Against Art Against Art |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manifestos have been written by other Stuckists, including the Students for Stuckism group. An "Underage Stuckists" group was founded in 2006 with a manifesto for teenagers written by two 16-year-olds, Liv Soul and Rebekah Maybury, on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html "The Underage Stuckists Manifesto"], stuckism.com.

In July 1999, the Stuckists were first mentioned in the media, in an article in ''The Evening Standard'' and soon gained other coverage, helped by press interest in Tracey Emin, who had been nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/news99.html Stuckism news 1999], stuckism.com.

The first Stuckist show was ''Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!'' in September 1999 in Joe Crompton's in [[Shoreditch]] Gallery 108 (now defunct), followed by  ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In 2000 they staged ''The Real Turner Prize Show'' at the same time as the [[Tate Gallery]]'s Turner Prize exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-891549-turner-prize-a-load-of-rubbish.do Turner Prize: a load of rubbish?], ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 24 October 2000.

A "Students for Stuckism" group was founded in 2000 by students from [[Camberwell College of Arts]], who staged their own exhibition. [[Stephen Howarth|S.P.

From 2002 to 2005 Thomson ran the [[Stuckism International Gallery|Stuckism International Centre and Gallery]] in Shoreditch, London. In 2003, under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', the gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before [[Damien Hirst]]'s) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. It was suggested that Hirst may have seen this and copied it.&lt;ref name=deadshark&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/SharkSpot.html "A Dead Shark Isn't Art"], stuckism.com.

In 2003 they reported [[Charles Saatchi]] to the UK [[Office of Fair Trading]], complaining that he had an effective monopoly on art.

==Responses &amp; Critique==
In 1999, two performance artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped on Tracey Emin's installation ''My Bed'', a work consisting of the artist's own unmade bed, at the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize, in an unauthorised [[art intervention]]. Chai had written, among other things, the words "Anti Stuckism" on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'' wrote (in 1999) that the event "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."&lt;ref name=satirists&gt;Gibbons, Fiachra (1999)[https://www.theguardian.com/turner1999/Story/0,12119,201733,00.html "Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed"]''[[The Guardian]]'' online, 25 October 1999. Retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Guardian'' ten years later, Jonathan Jones described the Stuckists as "enemies of art", and what they say as "cheap slogans" and "hysterical rants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The Stuckists are enemies of art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/oct/01/art-stuckist-manifesto |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 March 2015|date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist Max Podstolski wrote that the art world needed a new manifesto, as confrontational as that of [[Futurism]] or [[Dadaism]], "written with a heart-felt passion capable of inspiring and rallying art world outsiders, dissenters, rebels, the neglected and disaffected", and suggests that "Well now we've got it, in the form of Stuckism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Podstolski |first1=Max |title=Head vs. Heart: a Critique of the Stuckist Manifesto |url=http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |journal=Spark-online |issue=32.0 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328082935/http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |archivedate=28 March 2013 |date=May 2002 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York art gallery owner Edward Winkleman wrote in 2006 that he had never heard of the Stuckists, so he "looked them up on Wikipedia", and stated he was "turned off by their anti-conceptual stance, not to mention the inanity of their statement about painting, but I'm more than a bit interested in the democratization their movement represents." Thomson responded to Winkleman directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winkleman |first1=Edward |title=The Stuckists |url=http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2006/08/stuckists.html |accessdate=16 March 2015 |date=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Winkleman is notable in this context, read above for why--&gt;

Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, writing in ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', noted that the Stuckist's first exhibition in central London had brought "multiple sales" for leading artists of the movement, and that this raised the question of how good they were at painting. He observed that "Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan have already taken a punt. Six of Thomson's paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former [[jailbird]] who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleadell|first1=Colin|title=Market news: Roger Hilton's child-like drawings, 'stuckist' paintings and Edward Seago|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3655699/Market-news-Roger-Hiltons-child-like-drawings-stuckist-paintings-and-Edward-Seago.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC arts correspondent Lawrence Pollard wrote in 2009 that the way was paved for "cultural agitators" like the Stuckists, as well as the [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] and others, by the Futurist Manifesto of 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Back to the Futurists |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|right|thumb|''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907), also by Picasso in a different style ("[[Picasso's African Period]]") four years later.]]In the [[visual arts]], '''style''' is a "...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories"&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Fernie|Fernie, Eric]]. ''Art History and its Methods: A critical anthology''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-2991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates it to other works by the same artist or one from the same period, training, location, "school", [[art movement]] or [[archaeological culture]]: "The notion of style has long been the art historian's principal mode of classifying works of art. By style he selects and shapes the history of art".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] summarizing the view of [[Meyer Schapiro]] (with whom he disagrees), quoted by Alpers in Lang, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Style is often divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or [[art movement]], and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between "early", "middle" or "late".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In some artists, such as [[Picasso]] for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see, in others they are more subtle.  Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, between the very slow development in style typical of [[prehistoric art]] or [[Ancient Egyptian art]] to the rapid changes in [[Modern art]] styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in [[art history]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called "style art history" has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Kubler in Lang, 163–164; Alpers in Lang, 137–138; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] goes further "No human acts escape style", Kubler in Lang, 167; II, 3 in his list; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters.  Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably "largely unselfconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 106–107, 107 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including [[Gothic style|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Rococo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131; Honour &amp; Fleming, 13–14; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cubism]] on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably [[Chinese art]], has a marked tendency to revive at intervals "classic" styles from the past.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its [[iconography]], which covers the subject and the ''content'' of the work, though for [[Jas Elsner]] this distinction is "not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 107–108, 108 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
[[File:Ivory Egypt Louvre OA2753.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] ornament in ivory, centred on a [[palmette]]; [[Alois Riegl]]'s ''[[Stilfragen]]'' (1893) traced the evolution and transmission of such motifs.]]
Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on [[aesthetics]] did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it,&lt;ref&gt;classical authors did leave a considerable and subtle body of analysis of style in literature, especially [[rhetoric]]; see Gombrich, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture. [[Giorgio Vasari]] set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from [[Giotto]] to his own [[Mannerist]] period.  He stressed the development of a [[Florence|Florentine]] style based on ''disegno'' or line-based drawing, rather than [[Venice|Venetian]] colour.  With other Renaissance theorists like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Blunt throughout, with in particular pp. 14–22 on Alberti, 28–34 on Leonardo, 61–64 on Michelangelo, 89–95 and 98–100 on Vasari&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in [[Renaissance art]], and "[[Georg Hegel]] codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style", casting a very long shadow over the study of style.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Preziosi, 115–117; Gombrich, 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', but he never actually used the word, although in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', he uses the phrase ''der Geist seiner Zeit'' (the spirit of his time), writing "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262 |page=262 |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781847065919 |chapter=Zeitgeist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th-century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]], with important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continuing the debate in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3; Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe [[architectural style]]s, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting.  Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction.  A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131–136; Elkins, s. 2; Rawson, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[James S. Ackerman|James Ackerman]], [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[George Kubler]] (''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]'', 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; analysed by Kubler in Lang, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Jas Elsner]] put it more strongly: "For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead",&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though his article explores ways in which "style art history" remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as [[Counter-Maniera|Counter-''Maniera'']] appears to be in decline, as impatience with such "style labels" grows among art historians.  In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Georges Seurat, 1889-90 Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Georges Seurat]]'s very individual technique and style, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', 1889–90]]

A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the [[behavioural psychologist]] [[Colin Martindale]], who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on [[Darwinian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in his article "Evolution of Ancient Art: Trends in the Style of Greek Vases and Egyptian Painting", ''Visual Arts Research'', Vol. 16, No. 1(31) (Spring 1990), pp. 31–47, University of Illinois Press, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20715715 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style of an artist: "the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author's writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their [[art valuation|valuation for the art market]], above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance.  The identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as [[Connoisseur|connoisseur]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 139, a situation she sees as problematic&lt;/ref&gt; a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in grumbling by Grosvenor; Crane, 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of conoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the "hand" of different artists. [[Giovanni Morelli]] (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western [[old master]] paintings.  His techniques were adopted by [[Bernard Berenson]] and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir [[John Beazley]] to [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103; [http://arthistorians.info/morellig ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Giovanni Morelli"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical "secrets" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, throughout; 469–475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Manner of rembrandt harmensz van rijn christ among the doctors d5343274h.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Painting of ''[[Christ among the Doctors]]'', catalogued by [[Christie's]] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn" and sold for £750 in 2010]]

However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In [[Chinese art]] it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[literati painting]], but not others, such as Chinese porcelain;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 92–102; 111–119&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction also often seen in the so-called [[decorative arts]] in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Calligraphy, also regarded as a [[fine art]] [[Islamic calligraphy|in the Islamic world]] and [[East Asia]], brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while [[graphology]], which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

==Manner==
"Manner" is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Poetry?", "Petronius Arbiter"&lt;!-- pseudonym, not the Roman writer --&gt;, ''The Art World'', Vol. 3, No. 6 (Mar., 1918), pp. 506–511, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25588388 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, "manner" is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise.  When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the [[art trade]] for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with "Manner of [[Rembrandt]]" suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt's own style.  The "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" of the auctioneers [[Christie's]]' explains that "'''Manner of ...'''" in their auction catalogues means "In our opinion a work executed in the artist's style but of a later date".&lt;ref&gt;[http://christies.scene7.com/s7/brochure/flash_brochure.jsp?company=Christies&amp;sku=AMS3025_SaleCat&amp;config=Christies/eCat_210x267_Full&amp;locale=en&amp;image=Christies/AMS3025_SaleCat Christie's "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" (after lot listings)]. "Style" is not used for paintings etc., but for European porcelain they give the example:"A plate in the Worcester style" means "In our opinion, a copy or imitation of pieces made in the named factory, place or region". For examples, [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19224/lot/37/ this painting, sold by Bonhams in 2011] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", is now attributed in their notes to "an anonymous eighteenth-century follower of Rembrandt". [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/manner-of-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-christ-5343274-details.aspx This example sold by Christie's] fetched only £750 in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannerism]], derived from the Italian ''maniera'' ("manner") is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but "manner" can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
[[File:1911 Britannica-Archaeology-Palaeolithic.png|thumb|right|[[Paleolithic]] stone tools grouped by period]]

In [[archaeology]], despite modern techniques like [[radiocarbon dating]], period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] not only of works of art but all classes of [[archaeological artefact]], including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist).&lt;ref&gt;See also Alpers in Lang, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of individual styles of artists or [[artisan]]s has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the [[Ice Age art]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahn &amp; Vertut, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

As in art history, [[formal analysis]] of the [[morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] a [[relative dating]] based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific [[absolute dating]] techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thermoluminescence dating]] can be used for much ceramic material, and the developing method of [[Rehydroxylation dating]] may become widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sherd]]s of [[pottery]] are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from [[culture-historical archaeology]] to [[processual archaeology]] and finally the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]] in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mary Ann Levine of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'', edited by [[Margaret Conkey]] and Christine Hastorf (see further reading), pp. 779–780, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), Society for American Archaeology, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282229 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylization==
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the very stylized prehistoric [[Uffington White Horse]] in England]]
'''Stylization''' and '''stylized''' (or "stylisation" and "stylised" in (non-Oxford) [[British English]], respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (''[[mimesis]]'' or "[[Realism (arts)|realistic]]"), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction.  More technically, it has been defined as "the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color",&lt;ref&gt;"Stylization" in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 1979, online at [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stylization The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and observed that "[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Willene B., ''A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-Family Bestiary, Commentary, Art, Text And Translation'', p. 54, 2006, Boydell Press, {{ISBN|0851156827}}, 9780851156828, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0olPRmCoE8MC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqIaLTG4F&amp;sig=p-PbpnBNfgUusEYLRigTrlC3Ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fJo4UeflKYetPP3YgIgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient, traditional, and [[modern art]], as well as popular forms such as [[cartoon]]s or [[animation]] very often use stylized representations, so for example ''[[The Simpsons]]'' use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional [[African art]].  The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter's style,&lt;ref&gt;See Elsner, 107 on Picasso as the paradigm of "the supremely self-conscious poseur in any style you like".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uffington White Horse]] is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse.  Motifs in the [[decorative arts]] such as the [[palmette]] or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or "realism", a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work.  But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John, ''The Slumber of Apollo: Reflections on Recent Art, Literature, Language and the Individual Consciousness'', p. 30, 1983, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521248043}}, 9780521248044, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuoILxxW9cQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qJw4UbeGIsS7PaHJgNAC&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings, ''[[modelli]]'', and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

"Stylized" may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in [[American English]] is often used for the [[typographic]] style of names, as in "[[AT&amp;T]] is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t": this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''''Sundial, Boy With Spider''''' is an [[outdoor sculpture]] and functional [[sundial]] by American artist [[Willard Dryden Paddock]] (1873–1956). It is located within the [[Oldfields]] estate on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], United States. The [[bronze]] sculpture, cast by the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], depicts a boy sitting cross-legged with an open scroll in his lap.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculpture! | year=1993 | title=Sundial, Boy With Spider | work=SIRIS | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!26004~!0#focus| accessdate= 17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A young boy sits with his ankles crossed and knees spread, holding a sundial in the form of a scroll in his lap; this scroll is marked in a grid of lines with month names and geographic coordinates.  In his lap beneath the scroll sits a bundle of flowers. The boy’s proper left hand rests on his left knee. His proper right hand, which is in contact with his head, casually holds a twig over the scroll. A wire wrapped around the end of the twig hangs straight down to the base, where it is affixed. A bronze spider is affixed to the wire in the correct place to act as the [[gnomon]] of the sundial. (The wire, twig, and spider are restorations from 2004.)&lt;ref name=Conservation&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art.

Retrieved from Indianapolis Museum of Art Conservation Archives 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The boy rests on an oval base.

===Inscribed text===

====Scroll====
Inscribed on the scroll are a grid of lines and [[analemma]]s marked with months, dates, and hours sufficient to plot the time over the course of the year, as well as a set of [[coordinates]] that mark the original location of the sculpture:

:Lat 39°, 50 N  86°, 10 W Long

Inscribed on the proper left bottom corner:

:Dial Marking by Albert C. Crehore, inventor

====Base====
Cast in relief along the edge of the base in Roman letters:

:MARK YE THE HOURS OF LIGHT THAT SLIP AWAY ~ ~ ~ SPIN THEN THY HOUR OF SUNLIGHT WHILE YE MAY ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Inscribed on the base at proper left:

:© by Willard Paddock Sculptor

:Scpt. | 1916 1917

:PAT. FEB 26 1918-

Stamped along base rim under “WHILE”:

:O. BFC GORHAM CO. FOUNDERS

==Condition==
The bronze sculpture is monitored, cleaned, and treated regularly by the IMA art conservation staff.  The surface of the bronze is protected from deterioration and corrosion by the yearly application of a fresh coat of hard wax.  This sculpture was surveyed in July 1993 of as part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture database, and it was considered to be well maintained.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; In 2004 the IMA conservation staff undertook a major treatment of the sculpture in which the surface was repatinated to unify the color and improve its readability, and the newly fabricated wire and spider gnomon were added to restore the functionality of the sundial.&lt;ref name=Conservation&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, the wire and spider are currently missing from the sundial.

The '''Symphony No. 7''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed in 2000. It was written for and dedicated to the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]], by whom it was premiered on 19 June 2000 at the [[St Magnus Festival]], in the Pickaquoy Centre, [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]], conducted by the composer.

==Character and materials==
Davies regards this symphony as part of a seven-member [[Cycle (music)|cycle]], but not as its conclusion. Instead of ending, the Seventh Symphony forms a harmonic link to the opening of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Davies)|First Symphony]] {{harv|Service|2000}}. The composer describes the Seventh as his "most classical" symphony, with particular dependence on the music of [[Joseph Haydn]] {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (second doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani (a tom-tom or [[Rototom|roto-tom]] may be substituted for the piccolo timp), five percussionists (playing glockenspiel, marimba, crotales, tubular bells, 2 wood blocks (small, medium), tambourine, bubbolo, side drum, 2 bass drums (small, very large), antique cymbals, small suspended Chinese cymbal, clashed cymbals, 2 suspended cymbals (small, large), tam-tam), harp, celesta, and strings.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in four movements:
# Exposition
# Minuet and Trio
# Slow Movement
# Development

The first movement behaves as the [[Exposition (music)|exposition section]] (only) of a [[Sonata form|symphonic movement]], contrasting two types of musical material, both from each other, and from bridging music with less well-defined characteristics {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.
 
The second movement, in the classical form of a [[minuet and trio]], was inspired by the [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|op. 20 String Quartets]] of Haydn, though the musical surface does not sound like the Haydn models ({{harvnb|Davies|[2000]}}; {{harvnb|Service|2000}}).

Although the composer points to the simple, two- and three-part string writing at the beginning of the third, slow movement, as representing the spirit and style of Haydn's middle period {{harvnb|Davies|[2000]}}, the following build-up and climax has been seen as owing a heavy debt to [[Gustav Mahler]] {{harv|Service|2000}}.

The last movement is not a finale, but rather is titled "Development". Its dominant characteristic is that of the traditional [[musical development|development section]] of a classical symphony: systematic [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] through a succession of tonalities while, at the same time, ideas from earlier in the symphony are fragmented, reassembled, and reworked {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}. After a dramatic accelerando, a quotation from the slow movement arrives, followed by an inconclusive ending that links to the opening of the First Symphony {{harv|Service|2000}}, "so that the whole cycle could start over again" {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3197">The '''Symphony in E-flat''', Op. 1, is the first published work composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]] during his apprenticeship with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. It is also his first composition for orchestra. Of classical structure, it is broadly influenced by Rimsky-Korsakov, [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; It was composed in 1905–1907 and revised in 1913. It lasts for about forty minutes.

== History ==
The score bears the dedication "To my dear teacher N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov". A private performance was given on 27 April 1907 by the St. Petersburg Court Orchestra conducted by H. Wahrlich, in a concert that also included the first performance of ''Faun and Shepherdess''.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Stravinsky later recalled that both Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov considered the orchestration "too heavy".&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; The first public performance was conducted by [[Felix Blumenfeld]] on 22 January 1908. A revised version was conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]] on 2 April 1914, and the composer conducted this version in his later performances.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 [[Western_concert_flute|flute]]s (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 3 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[percussion]] and [[string_section|strings]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

== Movements ==
=== Allegro moderato ===
The first movement is in [[sonata form]].&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

=== Scherzo ===
This movement was sometimes played alone at performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Stravinsky incorporated into it a Russian folk song similar to one he used in ''[[Petrushka]]''.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

=== Largo ===
The longest movement of the symphony, lasting almost fifteen minutes.

=== Finale ===
The finale is a rondo.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; As in the second movement, Stravinsky includes a popular song ("Tchitcher-Yatcher"). He used it again in his ''Trois petites chansons'' of 1913.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

== Discography ==
* Stravinsky's recording of this symphony in his collected works on ''Sony Classical'' was recorded by the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]] in May 1966.&lt;ref name=Sony/&gt;

The '''Texas Centennial half dollar commemorative coin''' was minted to honor the [[Centennial]] of Texas's independence from [[Mexico]]. Early in the administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], on June 15, 1933, Congress passed an act to authorize the coinage of silver half dollars ''"in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary in 1936 of the independence of Texas, and of the noble and heroic sacrifices of her pioneers, whose revered memory has been an inspiration to her sons and daughters during the past century."'' This was the first of over two dozen commemorative bills that would become reality during Roosevelt's tenure. The legislation provided that "no more than one and a half million pieces" be created on behalf of the American Legion Texas Centennial Committee, located in [[Austin]] in that state.

The coin was designed by [[Pompeo Coppini]], a Texan. The [[obverse]] depicts an Eagle sitting on a branch in front of the Lone Star, the symbol of Texas. At the top right of the star it reads IN GOD WE TRUST, and to the left of the star it reads E PLURIBUS UNUM. Over the star it reads UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and at the bottom it reads HALF DOLLAR. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] depicts the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] spreading her wings over the Alamo. It also depicts Sam Houston on her left and Stephen F. Austin on her right. The Six Flags of Texas fly above her head. Under her it reads REMEMBER THE ALAMO. Over [[Sam Houston]], [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]], and [[Stephen F. Austin]] it reads THE TEXAS INDEPENDENCE CENTENNIAL. This coin was minted from 1934 to 1938.

==Mints==
The Texas Centennial Half Dollar was minted in [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]], [[Denver Mint|Denver]], and [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]]. The mint mark for the Denver (D) and San Francisco (S) issues appears on the reverse (back) under Victory above the word THE. Philadelphia issues do not have a mint mark.

There was a total of about 304,000 coins minted, eventually 154,522 were melted by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. The numbers that are in parenthesis are the number of coins after the Treasury melted them.

'''The Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain (CCGB)''' is an organisation open to all [[United Kingdom]] [[cartoonist]]s. Established in 1960 by a group of [[Fleet Street]] cartoonists, the club claims to be one of the largest cartoonists' organisations in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccgb.org.uk "Welcome to the Cartoonists' Club".]&lt;/ref&gt; with a membership of over 200 full- and part-time cartoonists both in the United Kingdom and abroad.

The club represents and supports cartoonists who create single gags to [[cartoon strip|strips]] and [[caricature]] to cartoon illustration, the CCGB provides a professional network for the up-and-coming new generation.

Many of the great names from the British cartoon fraternity have been members of the CCGB since its founding. The club has been responsible for organising many local, nationwide and international cartoon events, from exhibitions and competitions to charitable fund raising events or demonstrating the art of the Cartoon to young people at road shows and public exhibitions.

The CCGB works with many local towns and communities helping to promote the cause/art ofcCartooning in Britain.

[[File:The Love of Paris and Helen by Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''The Loves of Paris and Helen''''' is a 1788 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]], showing [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. It is now in the [[Louvre Museum]].

It was the result of a commission from the [[Charles X of France|comte d'Artois]]. It shows David in his 'galante' phase and was interpreted as a satire on the manners of the comte d'Artois. The [[caryatid]]s in the background are copies of those by [[Jean Goujon]] in the Louvre.

[[Image:Canova-Three_Graces_0_degree_view.jpg|thumb|''The Three Graces'', Canova's first version, now in the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
[[Antonio Canova]]’s [[statue]] '''''The Three Graces''''' is a [[Neoclassical sculpture]], in [[marble]], of the mythological three [[charites]], daughters of [[Zeus]] – identified on some engravings of the statue as, from left to right, [[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]], [[Aglaea]] and [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]] – who were said to represent youth/beauty (Thalia), mirth (Euphrosyne), and elegance (Aglaea). The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings, to delight the guests of the gods. As such they have served as subjects for historical artists including [[Sandro Botticelli]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].

A version of the sculpture is in the [[Hermitage Museum]], another is owned jointly and exhibited in turn by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[National Galleries of Scotland]].

==Versions of the piece==
[[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|John Russell]], the 6th [[Duke]] of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-three-graces/ ''The Three Graces''.] Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, 2013. Retrieved 2 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He had visited Canova's studio in [[Rome]] in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces which Canova produced for the [[Empress Josephine]]. When the Empress died in May of the same year he offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine’s son [[Eugène de Beauharnais|Eugène]] claimed it (his son [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg|Maximilian]] brought it to [[St. Petersburg]], where it can now be found in the [[Hermitage Museum]]). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself.

The sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817. In 1819 it was installed at the Duke’s residence in [[Woburn Abbey]]. Canova traveled to England to supervise its installation, choosing to display it on a [[pedestal]] adapted from a marble [[plinth]] with a rotating top. This item is now owned jointly by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], and is alternately displayed at each.

The version in the Hermitage is carved from veined marble and has a square pillar behind the left-hand figure ([[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]]). The Woburn Abbey version is carved from white marble and has a round pillar, and the central figure ([[Aglaea]]) has a slightly broader waist.

By the time he received the Duke's commission, Canova had already enjoyed an illustrious sculpting career. Born in the Italian province of [[Treviso]] in 1757, he was educated by his grandfather and his artistic talent was quickly noticed, especially by a Senator, Giovanni Falieri, who introduced him to the sculptor [[Giuseppe Torretto|Torretto]]. Torretto took Canova as apprentice for two years. 

[[Image:Canova-Three_Graces_340_degree_view.jpg|thumb|right|''The Three Graces'', alternate view, Hermitage Museum]] 
Canova went on to enjoy small commissions, but his fame did not come until 1780 when he traveled to [[Rome]] and found himself inspired and invigorated by the scope and quality of the art and architecture. During this time Canova produced some of his most revered works including: ''Theseus and the Minotaur'' (1782), his monument to Pope [[Clement XIV]] (now displayed in the [[basilica dei Santi Apostoli]]) and the masterminding of the sumptuous tomb of [[Clement XIII]] in St. Peter’s. In 1793 he produced ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'', a piece of immaculate composition and flowing beauty.  

In 1802, he was called to Paris by [[Napoleon I]], to model an enormous figure of the emperor clutching a ‘Victory’ in his hand. He would also model a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of the French leader as well as a statue of Napoleon's mother. The fact that these pieces represented only a fraction of his works during this period, make his dual commissions to sculpt the Graces understandable.

The sculpture for the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] was based on depictions of the Graces which Canova had previously made, including a 1799 painting, other drawings, and a relief of the Graces that he executed around the same time. 

In 1810, he modelled a [[terracotta]] sketch (now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon|Musée de Lyon]], France). But it is likely that his piece for the [[Empress Josephine]] and later the Duke was modelled mainly on the early drawings and a terracotta sketch model. We know that the immediate model for the work was a full-scale plaster group that has survived and is now in the [[Tempio Canoviano|Canova museum]] in [[Possagno]]. In the Duke of Bedford version, the graces are leaning on a pillar, though in earlier versions this feature was absent.

[[Image:Three_graces_statue_-_Oleksandriia_Park.jpg|thumb|''The Three Graces'': the Duke of Bedford's version]]

==Artistic technique and effect==
The piece is carved from a single slab of white [[marble]]. Canova's assistants roughly blocked out the marble, leaving Canova to perform the final carving and shape the stone to highlight the Graces’ soft flesh. This was a trademark of the artist, and the piece shows a strong allegiance to the [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] movement in sculpture, of which Canova is the prime exponent.  

The three goddesses are shown nude, huddled together, their heads almost touching in what many have referred to as an ‘[[erotically charged]]’ piece. They stand, leaning slightly inward – perhaps discussing a common issue, or simply enjoying their closeness. Their hair-styles are similar, [[hairstyle|braided]] and held atop their heads in a [[knot]].

The style is elegant and suggests refinement and class – there is a delicate [[beauty]] to them that is commonplace in Canova’s sculpture.  Art historians have often commented on the peaceful balance that seems to exist between the three heads. Unlike compositions of the Graces, which were derived from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] (where the outer figures turn out towards the viewer and the central figure embraces her friends with her back to the viewer) - Canova's figures stand side by side, facing each other.

The three slender female figures become one in their embrace, united by their linked hands and by a scarf which links them. The unity of the Graces is one of the piece's main themes. In Countess Josephine's version, the Graces are on a [[altar|sacrificial altar]] adorned with three [[wreath]]s of flowers and a garland symbolizing their fragile, close ties.

==Neo-Classicism and the Baroque==
Canova’s work challenged the [[baroque]] conception of opulent beauty; he shows the Graces as [[nubile]], svelte young women. This is not the only departure that Canova’s work makes from the Baroque. For example, The Baroque works of Italian sculptor [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] presents a stark moment in time - a snapshot. His 1644 work, ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|The Ecstasy of St. Theresa]]'', shows the moment at which the holy spirit pierces Theresa's heart, leaving her in what can only be described as ecstasy of divine presence. It is a dramatic, poignant scene captured by Bernini at the moment of greatest impact. Canova’s work, however, is different. His pieces do not seem to possess any real sense of time, they merely exist at a point in the past – almost ghostly reminders of a mythological happening, or person long deceased. In the case of the ''Graces'' he dispenses with [[theatrics]] and invites the viewer to make what they will of the scene. This is typical of the [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]] movement. In many respects this work was a departure and has since become regarded by many as a [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] of beauty.

The term '''toreutics''', relatively rare in English, refers to artistic [[metalworking]],&lt;ref&gt;''Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art'' Volume II (Aesthetics) by G. W. F. Hegel and T. M. Knox (1998) p.161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''How to Understand Sculpture'' by Margaret Thomas, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; - hammering [[gold]] or [[silver]] (or other materials), engraving, or using [[repoussé and chasing]] to form minute detailed reliefs or small engraved patterns.&lt;ref&gt;''Hutchinson Encyclopaedia''. Helicon Publishing LTD 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Toreutics can include metal-[[engraving]] – forward-pressure linear metal removal with a [[Burin (engraving) |burin]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Jewelry Concepts &amp; Technology'' by Oppi Untracht (1982) p.283
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological background==
[[File:Situle (musée national de Slovénie, Ljubljana) (9428277598).jpg|thumb|Toreutics on the [[Vače Situla]] (Slovenia, 5th century BC)]]
Toreutics claims great antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Understand Sculpture'' by Margaret Thomas, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, pp. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; It was practised in the [[Bronze Age]] and was well established centuries before the [[shaft graves]].&lt;ref&gt;''Social Transformations in Archaeology: Global and Local Perspectives (Material Cultures)'' by Kri Kristiansen (1998) p.135&lt;/ref&gt; Toureutic items of special quality from the [[Iron Age]] are the [[Certosa situla]] from Italy and from [[Slovenia]] the [[Vače situla]] and the [[Vače belt-plate]]. Toreutics flourished to an unusual degree among the peoples of [[Asia Minor]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylon]], and passed from thence to [[ancient Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'' by I. Gershevitch (1985) p.154&lt;/ref&gt; One spectacular example of the direct influence of Persia in toreutics is believed to be the [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]] found in [[Transylvania]] in 1799, and considered to be work of Old [[Bulgaria]]n&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Modern Bulgaria'' by R.J. Crampton, Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; gold smiths. It consists of 23 [[marine vessel|vessel]]s and has been attributed to [[Attila]]'s [[Huns]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Empire of the Steppes, a History of Central Asia'' by Rene Grousset (transl. by Naomi Walford), Rutgers University Press, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]&lt;ref&gt;''Warriors of the Steppe'' by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57–92&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pechenegs]]. The majority of scholars however, consider it [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] ([[Proto-Bulgarians]],&lt;ref&gt;''Bulgaria – Land of Ancient Civilizations'' by Dimiter Dimitrov, Foreign Language Press, Sofia 1961, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgars]]), because of its [[runic]] inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulgarian's Treasures from the Past'' by Ivan Venedikov, Sava Boyadjiev and Dimiter Kartalev, Foreign Languages Press, Sofia 1965, pp. 345–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Toreutics comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''toreutikos'':&lt;ref&gt;''Sculpture: Some Observations on Shape and Form from Pygmalion's Creative Dream'' by Johann Gottfried Herder and Jason Gaiger (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; of metal work; from ''toreutos'': worked in relief; from ''toreuein'';&lt;ref&gt;''Conspiracy of Catiline and the Jurgurthine War'' by Sallust (2004/6) p.62/72&lt;/ref&gt; to work in relief; from ''toreus'': a boring tool, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*terə-''. The art of working metal or other materials by the use of embossing and chasing to form minute detailed reliefs. The origin of 'toreutics' goes back to 1830–40; &lt; Gk ''toreutikós'', equiv. to ''toreú(ein)'' to bore, chase, emboss (v. deriv. of toreús graving tool) -tikos.

The [[Huis ten Bosch]], now a Dutch royal residence, was built on a site near [[The Hague]] given to [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]] in 1645 by the [[Dutch Republic]]&lt;ref name= Rooses &gt; Max Rooses, ''Jordaens: sa vie et ses oeuvres'', Amsterdam, 1906, pp. 160-174.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1647, before it was completed, Frederick Henry died and his devoted widow [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]] designed to make substantial changes to the design, turning it into a memorial to her late husband&lt;ref name=Gaehtgens&gt;{{fr icon}} Barbara Gaehtgens and Aude Virey-Wallon, ''L'Artémise de Gérard van Honthorst ou les deux corps de la reine'', in ''Revue de l'Art'', 1995, n. 109, pp. 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. She also acquired a painting of [[Artemisia II|Artemisia]], who raised the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] as a memorial to her dead husband [[Mausolus]]&lt;ref name= Gaehtgens/&gt;.

The Huis ten Bosch's dedication to Frederick Henry's memory can also be seen in its main hall, the ''[[Oranjezaal]]'', which contains a vast cycle of paintings celebrating his deeds and virtues&lt;ref name= Gaehtgens/&gt;, inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]' [[Marie de Medici cycle]] in Paris and the paintings allegorical ceiling paintings of [[James I of England]] in the [[Banqueting House]] in [[London]]&lt;ref name= Rooses /&gt;. Several painters were taken on to contribute to the cycle, from both the Dutch Republic and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. ''Triumph'' was the culmination of the cycle - Jordaens had already received a commission for the room's ''Allegory of Time'' in 1650. After the death of both Rubens and [[Anthony van Dyck]], Jordaens was now the leading painter of the Spanish Netherlands&lt;ref name= Rooses /&gt;. 

Amalia took on her husband's former secretary [[Constantijn Huygens]] and the architect [[Jacob van Campen]] to supervise the painting of the Oranjezaal cycle. Letters survive from Jordaens to Huygens, showing that Van Campen sent a plan of the room to the painter and that he proposed a number of modifications to his original idea. Three oil sketches for the ceiling by Jordaens also survive, probably produced for Amalia's and Van Campen's approval&lt;ref name=Speleers&gt; Lidwien Speleers e Margriet van Eikema Hommes, ''Jordaens and the Oranjezaal in Huis ten Bosch Palace, the paintings and the letters'', in Birgit Ulrike Münch and Zita Ágota Pataki (ed.), ''Jordaens: Genius of Grand Scale'', Stoccarda, 2012, pp. 131-140.&lt;/ref&gt;.  None of the sketches totally matches the final painting, probably showing that not all of the painter's proposals were approved&lt;ref name=Speleers/&gt;. Another letter survives from Jordaens to Amalia, explaining the allegorical meanings of the finished work&lt;ref&gt;Published in {{fr icon}} Max Rooses, ''Jordaens: sa vie et ses oeuvres'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description and style==
[[File:Allegoria dell'ingresso trionfale di Federico Enrico d'Orange all'Aia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon Savery]] and [[David Vinckboons]], ''Allegory of Frederick Henry's Triumphal Entry to the Hague'', 1629]]
Given the large number of similarities between the two works' iconography, Jordaens' probable model was a print by [[Salomon Savery]] after a drawing by [[David Vinckboons]]. This drawing was an allegory of Frederick Henry's triumphal entry into the Hague after the victories of [[Wesel]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]], his two great successes in the [[Eighty Years' War]]&lt;ref name=Speleers/&gt;.

In Jordaens' work, Frederick Henry is shown wearing armour and a deep red cloak (reminiscent of ancient Roman triumphal dress) seated on a throne in a triumphal chariot. A golden sculpture of Victory behind him holds two crowns, placing the one in her right hand on Frederick Henry's head and holding the other towards Frederick Henry's son [[William II of Orange]], shown as a young horseman in the bottom right. The nude [[Hymen (mythology)|Hymen]]) behind William crowns him with a golden garland surmounted by a crown - within that wreath are two joined hands, symbolising William's marriage to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s daughter [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]].

[[File:Oranjezaal na de restauratie- overzicht noordoosthoek, met de hele oostwand - 's-Gravenhage - 20416714 - RCE.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Oranjezaal'']]
Frederick Henry's chariot is drawn by four white horses with golden harness. A male figure wearing only a pseudo-Turkish dress rides one of them, holding a [[cornucopia]] of fruits and ears of grain, a symbol of abundance. Beside the horses [[Minerva]] (left) and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (right, in a winged hat and sandals) act as grooms and symbolise Frederick Henry's virtues of wisdom, martial virtue and cunning. Under their hooves the horses trample two terrible serpents (Discord) and a figure biting a heart (Envy). Two lions in front of the horses symbolise bravery and courage, whilst four of the [[Muses]] to the far left symbolise the four provinces of the Dutch Republic.

In the background is a triumphal arch flanked by two golden statues on pedestals, representing Frederick Henry's father [[William the Silent]] and his half-brother [[Maurice of Nassau]] (right), who both preceded him as [[Statolder]]. People gather around the statues to watch the triumphal procession. Above the horses a winged figure with a trumpet (Fame) beats back a skeleton, whilst higher still a woman in a white robe holds palm branches in both hands. She is surrounded by putti unrolling a long scroll inscribed &lt;small&gt;''ULTIMUS ANTE OMNES DE PARTA PACE TRIUMPHUS''&lt;/small&gt; (Fairest above all triumphs is that through which peace is gained), shown by a letter in the [[National Library of the Netherlands]] to have been invented by Huygens&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Cfr. Inge Broekman, ''Constantijn Huygens, de kunst en het hof'', PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2017, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;. This refers to the [[Peace of Munster]], the section of the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] of 1648 which guaranteed the Dutch Republic's independence and abandoned all Spanish claims to its lands&lt;ref name=Speleers/&gt; - Frederick died before the Treaty but his military victories had decisively paved the way for it. Several other putti at the very top of the painting hold a long festoon full of fruit, whilst others tip another cornucopia of coins and jewelery over Frederick Henry, symbolising riches and prosperity.

== Biography ==
'''Valentina Vasilievna Monakhova (born Valentina Vasilieva)''' was born August 23, 1932, in [[Leningrad]], USSR. In 1952 she entered the painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin]]. She studied at Leonid Khudiakov, Vasily Sokolov, Valery Pimenov, [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaytsev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Socialist-Realism-Leningrad-School/dp/5901724216|title="Unknown Socialist Realism.

In 1958 Valentina Monakhova graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute]], [[Boris Ioganson]] personal art studio. Her graduation work was genre painting named "Uzbek Family", painted on the material of artist's journeys in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentina Monakhova began to participate in Art Exhibitions Since 1959. She paints portraits, genre paintings, landscapes, still life, sketches from the life. Valentina Monakhova works in the technique of oil painting, tempera painting, and watercolors. Her personal exhibition was in 1985 in Leningrad.

In 1958—1961 Monakhova worked in Central Asia and created  big series of paintings and sketches on the theme of the East. Subsequently the leading theme of her work became the image of young people to be disclosed primarily in the genre of portrait. Since the 1980s Valentina Monakhova works mainly in watercolors in the genre of still life of flowers.

Over the years, Valentina Monakhova combined her creative activities with pedagogical work. She taught in the National Art School in city [[Dushanbe]], capital of [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tadzhik Soviet Republic]] (1958&amp;ndash;1960), then in the Tavricheskaya Art School in Leningrad (1961&amp;ndash;1978), and the Secondary School of Arts (now the Artistic Lyceum named after [[Boris Ioganson]] of the [[Russian Academy of Arts]]) (1978&amp;ndash;2007).

Valentina Monakhova is a member of [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]] (before 1992 - the [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]) since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''. - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. - p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">[[File:Vassiliki ware with long neck archmus Heraklion.jpg|thumb|Long-neck Vasiliki ware "teapot", with characteristic mottled decoration.]]
'''Vasiliki wares''' are a distinctive type of [[Minoan pottery]] produced in [[Crete]] during the [[Minoan]] period, named for the finds around the town of [[Vasiliki, Lasithi]], although it was produced at other sites too. The vases include a reddish-brown wash applied unevenly to mimic stone vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=esSIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 ''Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete''], Rodney Castleden&lt;/ref&gt;  The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it.  There is also a style painted in a creamy white over the reddish-brown wash applied all over the body.

The first examples of Vasiliki Ware are to be found in East Crete during EM IIA period, but it is in the next period, EM IIB, that it becomes the dominant form among the fine wares throughout eastern and southern Crete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minoancrete.com/vasiliki.htm Minoan settlement of Vasiliki] minoancrete.com&lt;/ref&gt; Dating [[Minoan chronology|varies between scholars]], but the Early Minoan II period is generally thought to run between around 2600-2000 BC.

The typical long-spouted pots, with a relatively small top mouth, are often called "teapots" by archaeologists; another common shape is called the "egg-cup".

[[File:Tomkin headstone, Ightham, Kent.jpg|thumb|'''William Stephen Tomkin''' is buried at Ightham, Kent, England]]
'''William Stephen Tomkin''' (25 November 1860 – 7 April 1940) was born at Park Road in the village of [[Boughton Monchelsea]], which lies on a ragstone ridge between the North Downs and the Weald of Kent, a few miles south of Maidstone.

There is a degree of conflict in William's birth date. His Birth Certificate clearly records this as being 25 November 1860 and registered on 5 January 1861. However, the family gravestone (photo) shows November 1861 - April 1940.

By 1871, the family had relocated some 20&amp;nbsp;km (12 miles) north-westwards to the cluster of villages that comprises [[Ightham]], Borough Green and Wrotham.  He was a watercolour artist, draughtsman, and assistant to General [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] between 1882-1890.

He was the first child of farmer William Stephen Tomkin (Snr) and Elizabeth his wife, who had married at St. Mary’s Church, Woolwich, in April 1859.

Elizabeth Tomkin was the elder sister of Benjamin Harrison (1837-1921) who had inherited a grocery/drapery store in the nearby village of Ightham from his father. Apart from being a village shopkeeper, Benjamin Harrison won international recognition as a pioneer in archaeology.  He maintained that the many flints – "eoliths" – which he found in the pre-glacial drift on the North Down were artefacts that challenged current beliefs about the antiquity of man.

Spending the greater part of his spare time on this amateur hobby, there is little doubt that Harrison would have been influential in the development of his young nephew William Tomkin; living quite close to each other at this time.  It is also conceivable that one of Harrison’s many contacts led to the young Tomkin being introduced to General [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]].  One possible link would be the renowned geologist Professor (knighted in 1896) Joseph Prestwich, who Harrison first met in the summer of 1879. They became regular correspondents, and met quite often, either at the Professor’s home in Shoreham or on Prestwich’s visits to Ightham – which are just 13&amp;nbsp;km (8 miles) apart. Prestwich also moved in the same intellectual circles as General Pitt Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='Harrison of Ightham'|last=Harrison|first=Sir Edward R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1928|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1891, W. S. Tomkin married Catherine Sarah Rattenbury.  Originally from Devon, her family had settled in Edmonton, Middlesex where she was born.  However, in 1881 she was living as a boarder, above a watchmaker’s shop, and employed as a village schoolmistress teaching children from Borough Green/Wrotham. She continued in this role until the spring of 1891.  It was during this decade that Tomkin was employed by Pitt Rivers.

By November 1890, Tomkin had ended his employment with Pitt Rivers and it is believed to be for financial reasons.  His next employment was with Waterlow &amp; Sons, a major worldwide engraver of currency, postage stamps, stocks and bond certificates based in London, Watford and Dunstable in England.  That company was founded as a family business in 1810.

On Census night, April 1891, Tomkin is shown to be living as a boarder at Grosvenor Road, Islington. 

Apart from his commercial work, Tomkin continued to be a prolific watercolour artist – a highly proficient painter of maritime subjects – exhibiting one, ''Wind Against the Tide'' at the Royal Academy in 1909.

In 1916, he recorded the shooting down of a German SL11 airship during a bombing raid, which crashed in flames at Cuffley, Hertfordshire on the night of 2/3 September; the first to do so on British soil.  Lieutenant W. Leefe Robinson of the Worcestershire Regiment &amp; Royal Flying Corps, was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The night scene, captured by Tomkin from his Walthamstow garden, contains a scrap from the wreckage and is now held at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London|RAF Museum]], Hendon, near to Cuffley.

William Stephen Tomkin died on 7 April 1940 at Chingford, Essex.

He is buried, with other family members, in the churchyard of St Peter's at Ightham, Kent.

His wife, Catherine Sarah Tomkin, died in 1954. Tomkin had three daughters who survived him. Dorothy, Janet, and Kate. Twin boys, the couple's first children, died shortly after their birth in 1892.

Small collections that include watercolours, sketchbooks and personal effects are held in General Pitt Rivers archives at [[The Salisbury Museum]], Wiltshire, England and [[Pitt Rivers Museum|Pitt Rivers museum]] in Oxford, England.

== 11 Spring Street Project ==
Wooster Collective was involved in gaining recognition for [[street art]] in its own neighborhood. In 2006,the website collaborated with Caroline Cummings and Bill Elias, members of a development group, with the idea of turning the building located at 11 [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[New York City]] into a temporary [[street art]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Last Hurrah for Street Art, as Canvas Goes Condo | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The address was about to be converted into [[condominium]] apartments.  

The idea for the project was set forth when Elias Cummings contacted  the Wooster Collective site and suggested that they curate a show at the location to celebrate the building's place in the history of [[street art]].

The show ran for three days, from December 15 to December 17, 2006.  Street artists who had been featured in the Wooster Collective, such as [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], [[Dan Witz]], [[Above (artist)|Above]], Bo130,  Doze Green,  [[D*Face]], [[The London Police]], Skewville, [[Lady Pink]], Microbo, Jace, Kostas Seremetis, [[John Fekner]] and [[Don Leicht]], Ruslan Karablin, [[Graffiti Research Lab]], Will Barras, WK Interact, and many more participated in the event.  The art was left on the walls and built over (a nod to a tradition in [[construction]] of leaving newspapers in the walls of a house as a sort of "time capsule"), thereby leaving a legacy of [[street art]] behind for future excavators.

== YouTube channel ==
In August 11, 2009, the Wooster Collective launched its own channel on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWoosterCollective|title=TheWoosterCollective|website=YouTube|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With videos and reports similar to those found on its website.

== Books ==
In 2012, Wooster Collective released the second in a series of 'Wooster on Paper' books called ''Graphite'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woostercollective.com/post/announcing-wooster-on-paper-2-graphite|title=Wooster Collective: Announcing Wooster on Paper #2: Graphite|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured pencil drawings by a number of their favourite artists including Paul Alexander Thornton, Connor Harrington and Word to Mother.

'''Zoma Museum  ( Formerly Known As Zoma Contemporary Art Center''' ('''ZCAC''') &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/07/10/ethiopian-enterprise-artists-build-future-addis-ababa-beyond/|title=Ethiopian Enterprise: Artists Build a Future in Addis Ababa and Beyond|last=Awake|first=Mik|date=2018-07-10|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an environmentally conscious [[artist in residency]] project with locations in [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Harla]], a historical village near [[Dire Dawa]] in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/institue/zoma-contemporary-art-center/|title = Zoma Contemporary Art Center|date = |accessdate = |website = Contemporary And|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its links and considerable work with European and American galleries, ZCAC has been influential in the [[contemporary Ethiopian visual art]] sector and as a conduit for Ethiopian artists to be featured internationally. It is currently headed by curator [[Wikipedia:WikiAfrica/Stubs/Meskerem Assegued|Meskerem Assegued]].

== History ==
The concept was first introduced to the public in 2002 during&amp;nbsp;Giziawi #1, its first art happening. Named after [[Zoma Shifferaw]], a young Ethiopian artist who died of cancer in 1979, ZCAC is located in two major cities in Ethiopia. ZCAC Addis is in a house built by [[Elias Sime]] in Addis Ababa, and ZCAC Harla is in Harla, a small historic village east of Dire Dawa. ZCAC is run like a family where the surrounding community is an extension of the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://zcac.weebly.com/zcac.html|title = Zoma Contemporary Art Center|date = |accessdate = |website = Zoma Contemporary Art Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

=== ZCAC Addis Ababa ===
[[file:ZCAC Addis Compound.jpeg|thumb|ZCAC Addis Ababa Compound]]

The construction of ZCAC begun in 2002 by Elias Sime, which  took him about seven years to build the unique building of mud and straw. Due to Elias' solo exhibition “Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart” (2009) at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]], the house attracted the attention of the world media.&amp;nbsp;The New York Times Magazine&amp;nbsp;called it “a voluptuous dream, a swirl of ancient technique and ecstatic imagination”. The house is the home of ZCAC Addis and features a showroom and a studio for visiting artists. In 2014, the New York Times selected ZCAC's photo for their article about&amp;nbsp;52 places to go in 2014.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/10/travel/2014-places-to-go.html?_r=1|title = 52 Places to go in 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = New York Times|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== ZCAC Harla DireDawa ===
Harla is a small village located in hills roughly 15 kilometers from Dire Dawa encompassing  several archaeological sites. In 2007, ZCAC received a piece of land in Harla from the Dire Dawa city administration. Following ZCAC's goals, sustainable buildings are being constructed there.

== Zoma School ==
Zoma School is an edible schoolyard where students learn to create and sustain an organic garden in a landscape that is wholly integrated into the schools’ curriculum, culture and food program. 

Inspired by [[Alice Waters]] [[Edible Schoolyard]] project, Zoma School aims to provide an education system where children are thought mathematics, science, language and art by integrated garden and kitchen classes. 

One of the activities taught to kids at the school is how to [[unicycle]]. The founders believe that children will build a lifetime of confidence through the trail and error that it takes to learn how to unicycle and with out much help from adults.
