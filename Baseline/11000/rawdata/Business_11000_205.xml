A '''tenured''' appointment is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for [[Causation (law)|cause]] or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation. Tenure is a means of defending the principle of [[academic freedom]], which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.

The modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure – AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&amp;U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement holds that, "The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.

== By Country ==
=== North America ===
{{See also|Academic tenure in North America}}
Under the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm "Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure"].&lt;/ref&gt;) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be "tenure track." Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}
Academic tenure was eliminated in the United Kingdom in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=Jürgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics. A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities.

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/UnitedKingdom|title=United Kingdom, Academic Career Structure|work=European University Institute|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Germany ===
{{See also|Habilitation#Germany|Academic ranks in Germany}}
Academics are divided into two classes. On the one hand, professors (C2/W2 positions in the old/new system of pay grades) are employed as civil servants of the state and hold tenure as a highly safeguarded employment for life. On the other, there is a much bigger group of "junior staff" on fixed-term contracts, research grants, fellowships, and part-time jobs. In 2010, 9% of academic staff were professors, 66% were "junior staff" (including doctoral candidates on contracts), and 25% were other academic staff in secondary employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buwin.de/dateien/2013/buwin2013keyresults.pdf/view|title=buwin2013keyresults.pdf — BuWiN 2017|website=www.buwin.de|language=de|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent research, teaching and management positions below professorship as an "Akademischer Rat" (a civil service position salaried like high school teachers) have become relatively rare compared to the 1970s and 1980s and are often no longer refilled after a retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/akademische-karrieren-manche-verteidigen-das-system-als-charakterbildend-/5942506-3.html|title=Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse an Universitäten nehmen zu
|language=de|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to attain the position of Professor an academic must usually complete a "[[Habilitation]]" (a kind of broader second PhD thesis), after which she or he is eligible for tenureship. This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the "Juniorprofessur" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but rarely endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to "Habilitation". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a "Habilitation" and a successfully completed "Juniorprofessur" varies across the different states (''Bundesländer''), and the informal recognition of having served as a "Juniorprofessur" as a replacement for the "Habilitation" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.

Due to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is stronger and more independent than, for instance, in France.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion; for example, the question of relating professorial pay to performance rather than merely to age is now being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724064559/http://www.eui.eu:80/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Germany.aspx#SecurityInThePosition|title=Germany, Academic Career Structure • European University Institute|date=24 July 2017|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments in favor ==
Many argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more. 

== Arguments against ==
Some have argued that modern tenure systems diminish academic freedom, forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the level of mediocrity as those awarding the tenured professorships. For example, according to physicist [[Lee Smolin]], "...it is practically career suicide for a young theoretical physicist not to join the field of [[string theory]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Trouble with Physics]]|author=Lee Smolin|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-101835-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Steven Levitt]], who recommends the elimination of tenure in order to incentivize higher performance among professors, also points out that a pay increase may be required to compensate faculty members for the lost job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/2007/03/03/lets-just-get-rid-of-tenure/|title=Let’s Just Get Rid of Tenure (Including Mine)|last1=Levitt|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Levitt|website=[[Freakonomics]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states have considered legislation to remove tenure at public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/13/legislation-two-states-seeks-eliminate-tenure-public-higher-education|title=Killing Tenure|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further criticism of tenure is that it rewards complacency. Once a professor is awarded tenure, he or she may begin putting reduced effort into their job, knowing that their removal is difficult or expensive to the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/07/study-links-tenure-criteria-long-term-professor-performance|title=Study links tenure criteria to long-term professor performance|website=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">'''Alfred Faust''' (15 December 1883 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1961) was a [[Germany|German]] advertising executive, journalist, editor, and left-wing politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Alsace]] (today part of [[France]]) in 1883, Faust was the son of a master plumber and winemaker. He had a business education, and an apprenticeship in printing, as well as attending a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] seminar in [[Belgium]]. In his youth he did military service, graduating as a [[Grenadier]] in [[Berlin]], going on to teach [[French language|French]] from 1905 on. From 1909 to 1914 Faust was a journalist, later working with advertisement for the company [[Café HAG]], working in [[Bremen]].

Between 1914 and 1918, Faust was called into the [[Imperial German Army]], and fought in the [[First World War]]. In 1917, before the war's end, he joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), a left-wing split from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). When the war ended in 1918, he became heavily involved in radical politics, joining the December Imperial Council Congress ({{lang-de|Reichsrätekongress}}) in Berlin. Returning to Bremen, he joined the government of the brief [[Bremen Soviet Republic]] (existing between January and February 1919). He was selected by the city's [[Workers' council|workers' and soldiers' council]] to serve as People's Commissar of press and propaganda, together with [[Curt Stoermer]]. He also served as editor of the ''[[Bremer Bürger-Zeitung]]'', which had been occupied by the workers.

After the defeat of the Bremen Soviet Republic at the hands of the Army and [[Freikorps Caspari]], he became chief editor of the ''Bremer Arbeiterzeitung''. In March 1919 he became a member of the Bremen National Assembly, serving as a deputy of the [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen]] from 1920 to 1933. In 1922 he joined the SDP,  after the USDP was merged with it once more. Faust became an editor of the ''Bremer Volkszeitung'', led by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], becoming its chief editor in 1928.

Elected to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] after the [[German federal election, November 1932|November 1932 federal election]], it wasn't until March 1933 that his seat was confirmed. The same month, after the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], he helped the fellow SDP politician [[Rudolf Breitscheid]] escape to [[Switzerland]], but returned to Bremen himself. A month later, on 28 April, he was put in "[[Protective custody#Nazi Germany|protective custody]]" by the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), and held in ''KZ Mißler'', an early [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in Bremen that later also held his fellow Bremen Soviet Republic politician [[Hermann Böse]]. Later placed in other detention centers, Faust was strongly physically abused by his captors, especially in ''KZ Mißler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akens.org/akens/texte/info/36/3.html|title=Vom Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst zum Konzentrationslager|last1=Wollenberg|first1=Jörg|last2= |first2= |date=|language=German|website=www.akens.org|publisher= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent time in prison until 1934, when he was released from jail and expelled from Bremen, settling in Berlin. He worked for [[Ludwig Roselius]], pro-Nazi founder of his previous employer Café HAG, at the ''Angelsachsenverlag''. [[Barbara Goette]] worked and corresponded extensively with Faust in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the publisher was closed in 1944, he fled to his native Alsace, working as an editor in [[Mulhouse]] until 1949. In August 1949 Faust returned to Bremen again, rejoining the ''Angelsachsenverlag''. From 11 July 1950 on until his death he was head of the press office of the [[Senate of Bremen]].

After his death in 1961, the a street was named for him in the Obervieland district of Bremen: ''Alfred-Faust-Straße''.

'''Arthur Witty Cotton''', also known as '''Don Arturo''', was a footballer, club president and businessman. Witty played for [[FC Barcelona]] in the first [[Copa del Rey]] final and later served as club president between 1903 and 1905. He was also a successful trader and his family company, the Witty Group, continues to operate today. He is the older brother of [[Ernest Witty]].

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Witty was the son of Frederick Witty, a British entrepreneur, who settled in [[Barcelona]]. Frederick, who belonged to a [[Yorkshire]] family, initially intended to emigrate to Argentina but was persuaded to go to Spain by friends. In 1873 he founded his own shipping agency under the name of F. Witty, subsequently establishing business links between Spain and the United Kingdom. Arthur and his brother, Ernest, were educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby|Merchant Taylors' School]] in Merseyside, where sport was regarded as a major part of a young man's development. While at Merchant Taylors, Arthur played as a forward for the local [[rugby union]] team, [[Waterloo FC]]. On their return to [[Barcelona]] the two brothers joined their father's company which now became known as ''Witty Sociedad Anónima'', Witty S.A.

=== FC Barcelona footballer ===
Arthur and Ernest returned to Spain with a love of sports. Unable to play [[rugby union]] due to a lack of suitable pitches, the Wittys began to organise [[association football|football]] games between company teams made up of employees. In 1899 Ernest also became a founding member of the [[Real Club de Tenis Barcelona]]. Ernest, a Spanish national tennis champion, played tennis with, among others, [[Joan Gamper]] and when Gamper founded [[FC Barcelona]] in October 1899, the Witty brothers quickly became involved. They used their company to imports regulation balls, referees whistles and nets from England. Legend also has it that the Witty brothers also imported the legendary club colours, the ''blaugrana'', from the original colours used by Merchant Taylors' rugby team. However [[FC Basel]] and other clubs that Gamper played for and his home canton of [[Zurich]] and have all been credited and/or claimed to be the inspiration. Either way, Old Merchant Taylors' BaaBarians hockey team carry FC Barcelona shirts as their away strip in tribute to Arthur Witty.

In early December 1899 the club played its first official game against an ''English Select'' at the ''Velòdrom de la Bonanova'', now known as ''Turó Park''. The teams only had ten men each and the ''English Select'' actually included several [[FC Barcelona]] players, among them, Arthur Witty. The ''English Select'' won the game 1–0 with Witty scoring the only goal. On Christmas Eve 1899 Witty made his official debut for the club in a 3–1 win over Català SC.

[[FC Barcelona]] was one of several football clubs formed in the city around this time and soon there was enough teams to organise a regular competition, the [[Copa Macaya]]. Witty was a member of the FC Barcelona team which won its first ever trophy, the Copa Macaya in 1902. He also played for FC Barcelona in 1902 when they were invited to enter the first ever [[Copa del Rey]]. After beating Madrid FC, later to become [[Real Madrid]], 3-1 in the first round, they lost 2–1 to [[Club Vizcaya]] in the final. Witty also helped the club win the [[Copa Barcelona]] in 1903. Between 1899 and 1905 Witty played 74 games, mainly as a full-back for FC Barcelona.

=== FC Barcelona President ===
Witty became president of [[FC Barcelona]] on 17 September 1903 after having previously served on the board of directors. During his presidency the club won the its first [[Catalan football championship|Championat de Catalunya]] with a squad that included Ernest Witty and [[Romà Forns]]. The latter was one of several young reserve players Witty introduced into the team. By now [[FC Barcelona]] had acquired a strong fan base within the city and Witty arranged for the club to play their home games at the ''Carrer Muntaner''. Witty also organised the club's first trip abroad which resulted in their first game against a non-Spanish team. On 1 May 1904 [[FC Barcelona]] beat [[Stade Toulousain|Stade Olympien des Étudiants Toulousains]] 3-2. The same opponents were then invited back to [[FC Barcelona]] to play the inaugural game at the ''Carrer Muntaner''. [[FC Barcelona]] won this game 4–0 with two goals from [[Joan Gamper]]. Witty stepped down as president on 6 October 1905.

=== After Barcelona ===
In June 1924 Witty briefly became involved in controversy when he invited the [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marine]] band that played ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' at [[Camp de Les Corts|''Les Corts'']], after their attempts to play the Spanish national anthem were jeered. As a result, Witty became disillusioned at the politicalisation of [[FC Barcelona]] club and, while remaining a fan, he gradually began to distance himself from the club. During the 1930s Witty and his son, Frederick Jr., established the family company as traders and helped introduce well known names such as [[Cadbury Schweppes|Cadburys]], [[Johnnie Walker]], [[Unilever]] and [[Bovril]] into the Spanish market. Witty also served as President of the Barcelona Ship Agents Association until 1936 and was a leader in the [[Barcelona]] and Spanish shipping communities. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the company was exempted from a takeover by a workers committee as it was technically a British-owned company and it continued to trade successfully. During the [[Second World War]], Witty left Spain, leaving the business in hands of a lawyer. He returned during the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] years and regained his status as a leading shipping agent. Together with his brother he also opened a successful sports shop.

[[File:BCMEA logo.svg|thumb|BCMEA logo]]
The '''British Columbia Maritime Employers Association''' is an association representing the interests of member companies in industrial relations on Vancouver's and other [[British Columbian]] seaports.

The BCMEA currently consists of sixty-seven member companies with commercial interests based on the waterfronts of [[Vancouver]] and other seaports in [[British Columbia]]. The BCMEA is the Employer Association of companies that employ [[longshoremen]], who in turn are represented by the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] to bargain with the BCMEA on their behalf. In addition to collective bargaining, the BCMEA handles everyday labour matters, such as administering the collective agreement, payroll services, discipline, and grievance and arbitration hearings on behalf of its members.

Formed after [[World War I]] to handle the rapidly growing commercial traffic on the waterfront, it was originally called the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, comprising shipping and railway companies, terminal and storage operators, and container companies.

==History==
The Shipping Federation was established during what Canadian historians have called the [[Canadian Labour Revolt]] in the period following World War I, which peaked in Canada with the [[Winnipeg General Strike]] in 1919. the Employers felt they needed to band together, not only because port operations were becoming increasingly complex, but as a bulwark against unionism generally, and union militancy in particular. Vancouver hosted the first Canadian [[General Strike]] in Canada in 1918 following the police killing of union leader, [[Ginger Goodwin]]. The following year a longer and more extensive general strike was called by the [[Trades and Labour Council]] in sympathy with the strike in Winnipeg. Longshoremen were among the first to walk out, but were quickly replaced by strikebreakers who were mainly university and high school students.

By the time the next strike erupted on Vancouver's waterfront, the Shipping Federation had adopted an even more rigidly anti-union policy, influenced by its recent association with counterparts in the United States, who were following what had been dubbed the [[American Plan (union negotiations)|American Plan]]. It then set out to break the union completely and establish a company union. Again, it recruited strikebreakers both as replacement workers and as [[Special Constabulary|special constables]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]]'s ocean liner, the [[CP Ships|''Empress of Japan'']], was used to house strikebreakers for the duration of the strike. The strike was quickly brought to an end after the Federation took over the duties of despatching work gangs from the union and refused to negotiate with the union, the [[International Longshoremen's Association]]. It established the [[Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association]] to replace the ILA as a company union.

Almost a decade of peace followed the 1923 strike. It was not a lasting peace however, and in 1933 the Shipping Federation discovered  that not only had the union been transformed by [[Communist Party]] organizers into a militant union, but also that agitators were planning a general strike for the province to begin on Vancouver's waterfront in 1935.

Communists were active both on the waterfront and in the government relief camps for the unemployed, as well as several other industries, organizing workers into unions affiliated with the Communist trade union umbrella, the [[Workers' Unity League]]. During this era, the [[Comintern]], or Communist International in Moscow was prescribing a policy of dual unionism. The Shipping Federation was thus centrally positioned during what was effectively another [[Red Scare]] in 1935.

The general strike never happened in 1935, and striking relief camp workers left the city shortly after the waterfront strike finally was called for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]]. Technically it was a lock-out. The union voted to take back control of despatching work gangs because discrimination, blacklisting, and the arbitrary allocation of work had long been a major grievance for longshoremen. According to the most recent contract however, the Federation was to handle dispatching, and therefore treated the union's action as a breach of contract.

The 1935 strike had seeped into the political realm much more extensively than the 1923 strike had. The civic administration of [[Gerald Grattan McGeer|Mayor Gerry McGeer]], along with his chief constable, [[William Wasbrough Foster|Colonel Foster]] had joined with the Shipping Federation to defeat the Communist threat. The Communists had been planning to merge the waterfront and relief camp strike, and hopefully other industrial workers into a general strike. Although these various groups of worker's were willingly under Communist leadership, they primarily were pursuing resolution to their own workplace grievances, not a [[proletarian revolution]].

The strike peaked with the July 18, 1935 [[Battle of Ballantyne Pier]], where the police clashed with strikers and their supporters who had attempted to march down to the harbour. Three levels of police were on hand, plus a plethora of special constables, organized in part by the Shipping Federation's [[Citizens' League of British Columbia]], a vigilante group it funded to fight the strike and generate anti-strike/anticommunist propaganda. Again, the strike was broken, and the union replaced with a company union.

The Communists shifted away from the [[dual unionism]] strategy and dissolved the Workers' Union League. Agitators now put their organizing energy behind the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] industrial union movement. The Shipping Federation stepped back from it overt anticommunism, but continued to fund a variation of the Citizens' League, the [[Industrial Association of British Columbia]] under the leadership of [[Charles Edgar Edgett|Colonel C. E. Edgett]], former police chief, prison warden, and leading local anticommunist polemicist. Nevertheless, workers managed to establish and sustain an independent union under [[Harry Bridges]]'s new [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] (ILWU) that still exists today.

Category design extends beyond a [[Leadership|leadership team's]] narrower focus on products, [[Organizational culture|company culture]] and [[business model]]s.

== History ==
Category design is

* discovering and defining a category problem,
* creating a clear story (called a [[Point of view (philosophy)|point-of-view]]) that explains and sells the category idea,
* defining a category blueprint,
* driving the category strategy across a company's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (mobilization),
* shaping customers' thinking (lightning strikes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/play-bigger/the-key-to-designing-your-company-success-category-king.html|title=How to Design a Business That Dominates Its Niche|last=|first=|date=13 Jun 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-07-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concepts tie back into recent writings about how our brains work, particularly [[cognitive bias]]es as described by [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-came-behavioural-economics-now-its-time-liz-griffith|title=First came behavioural economics – Now it's time for behavioural marketing|last=Griffith|first=Liz|date=2017-04-19|work=Linkedin Pulse|access-date=2017-06-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good category takes advantage of cognitive biases such as the choice supportive bias and [[groupthink]] bias.

After the book was published in June 2016, [[Mike Maples]], a founding partner of [[Floodgate Fund|Floodgate]], published articles supporting the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/floodgates-mike-maples-on-what-makes-category-kings/|title=Floodgate's Mike Maples on what makes category kings {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Stebbings|first=Harry|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 6–10 law ===

Data research shows that "category kings" (companies that dominates a market category)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/05/keys-to-ascending-the-consumer-internet-throne/|title=Keys to ascending the consumer-internet throne {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Lee|first=Roger|last2=Lu|first2=Jeff|access-date=2017-06-27|last3=Ravichandran|first3=Deepak}}&lt;/ref&gt; that go public when they are between six and ten years old create most of the value among all VC-funded tech companies. Companies that go public sooner than six years old often lose value; companies that [[Initial public offering|IPO]] after ten years old create little value for [[shareholder]]s. The reason is thought to be that categories take around six years to develop, and most of a category's growth happens in that six to ten year timeframe. After ten years, a category is established and growth slows, so [[share price]]s level off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sandhill.com/article/the-6-10-law-data-science-reveals-how-age-and-money-impact-startup-value-creation/|title=The 6–10 Law: Data Science Reveals How Age and Money Impact Startup Value Creation {{!}} Sandhill|website=sandhill.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was discussed in a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article titled "How Unicorns Grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/online/unicorns-mythological-creatures/|title=Unicorns and Other Mythological Creatures|website=harvardpolitics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Dangote Cement is Nigeria's largest cement producer with three plants in Nigeria and plans to 
expand in 13 other African countries. The company is a fully integrated quarry-to-depot producer with 
production capacity of 19.25mmtpa in Nigeria at the end of 2012. The company plans to build a further 19mmtpa of production, grinding and import

In [[variance analysis (accounting)]] '''direct material price variance''' is the difference between the [[standard cost]] and the [[actual cost]] for the [[actual quantity]] of material purchased. It is one of the two components (the other is [[direct material usage variance]]) of [[direct material total variance]].

==Example==
Let us assume that the standard direct material cost of [[Widget (economics)|widget]] is as follows:
:2 kg of [[unobtainium]] at € 60 per kg ( = € 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212&amp;nbsp;kg of [[unobtainium]] which cost € 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material price variance can be calculated as:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBox|tx1=212 kg of [[unobtainium]] should have cost (&amp;times; € 60)
|tx2=but did cost
|tx3=Direct material ([[unobtainium]]) price variance
|am1=12,720
|am2=13,144
|am3=424
|va1=A
}}
Direct material price variance is because Todd pays too much for steel can be reconciled to [[direct material total variance]] by way of [[direct material usage variance]]:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBoxRec|tx1=Direct material usage variance
|tx2=Direct material price variance
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=720
|am2=424
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
|va2=A
|va3=A
spending variance seen as per product cost
(212*62)-(200*60)
See [[direct material total variance#Example]] and [[direct material usage variance#Example]] for computations of both components.

{{Italic title}}
A '''''directeur sportif''''' ([[French language|French]] for [[sporting director]], although the original French term is often used in English-language media; plural ''directeurs sportifs'') is a person directing a [[cycling team]] during a [[road bicycle racing]] event.  It is seen as the equivalent to a field manager in baseball, or a head coach in football. At professional level, a directeur sportif follows the team in a car and communicates with riders, personnel and race officials by [[radio]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LSW DS ramirez.jpg|thumb|300px|Directeur sportif of the Liberty Seguros-Wurth team riding in the team car.  The car carries spare [[Racing bicycle|bikes]] and [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]] ]] --&gt;The directeur sportif warns of obstacles or challenging terrain, updates the team on the situation in the race, and provides mechanical help.  The car carrying the directeur sportif also usually carries a [[bicycle mechanic]] with spare [[bicycle|bikes]], [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] and parts.  It also carries spare water bottles, food and medical equipment.

In recent years the role has increased, in keeping with better team cohesion, tactics and [[telecommunication|communication]] and [[telemetry]] equipment.  The directeur sportif can have split times, find where riders from other teams are in the race, and dictate orders to riders.  This has made teamwork and tactics more important.

A directeur sportif can also be involved in the riders' training and racing programme. Many are former professionals, such as [[Johan Bruyneel]] and [[Sean Yates]].

[[Gord Fraser (cyclist)|Gord Fraser]] described his role as directeur sportif as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/racing/wheel-and-still-race |title=At the Wheel, and Still in the Race |last1=Sumner |first1=Jason |date=21 February 2012 |website=[[Bicycling (magazine)]] |access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Probably the first thing is that I’m the person who has to come up with a tactical plan at the races that will maximize the potential of the team. I’m also a motivator. I have to have a good eye for talent. I have to have recruitment skills. I have to be good with media and sponsors. And it’s best if I’m not a reckless driver since I spend so much time driving in close proximity to people riding bikes. But really, it all goes back to having the right plan in place, and coming up with a good set of options, then making sure those scenarios are communicated to the riders so they can execute that strategy during the race.}}

Several directeurs sportifs are also associated with famous riders whom they have nurtured. [[Patrick Lefevère]] with [[Johan Museeuw]] and [[Tom Boonen]], [[Cyrille Guimard]]'s relationship with [[Bernard Hinault]], and later [[Laurent Fignon]]; [[Jean de Gribaldy]] with [[Sean Kelly (cyclist)|Sean Kelly]] and [[Joaquim Agostinho]]; and Bruyneel with [[Lance Armstrong]] are examples.

The '''Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations''' ('''FEAPO''') is a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[enterprise architecture]].

== Organization ==
The Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations (FEAPO) is a worldwide professional organization for the advancement of enterprise architecture. Its mission is "to provide a forum to discuss cross organizational activities, standardize, professionalize and otherwise advance the discipline of enterprise architecture."&lt;ref name="SI 2011"&gt;Stephen IBaraki. "[http://stephenibaraki.com/cips/v0211/brian_cameron_feapo_part1.html Brian Cameron: Professor and Executive Director, Center for Enterprise Architecture, Penn State, Founder FEAPO]." at stephenibaraki.com, 2011. Accessed 24-03-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding director Brian Cameron (2011) explained that the idea arose from the "desire to do something about the current fragmentation between the many enterprise architecture related professionals organizations."&lt;ref name="SI 2011"/&gt;

FEAPO was founded in 2011 by nine professional organizations, and in 2015 consists of the following 17 member organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Federation of EA Professional Organizations - Directory, http://feapo.org, Accessed: 18 Nov 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Common Perspectives on Enterprise Architecture,'' 2013 ===
The 2013 paper "Common Perspectives on Enterprise Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;FEAPO, "Common Perspectives on Enterprise Architecture," ''Architecture and Governance'', 6 Nov 2013(2013): issue 9-4&lt;/ref&gt; describes the field of [[enterprise architecture]] and the value that the enterprise architecture function brings to an organization. The focus of this paper is to provide a unified perspective of enterprise architecture to a wide-ranging audience, not just to the architects themselves, but also to the people who interact with the architects, and others who want to learn about enterprise architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Brian; "The FEAPO Enterprise Architecture Perspective Initiative," ''Architecture and Governance'', 6 Nov 2013(2013): issue 9-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper [[enterprise architecture]] is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A well-defined practice for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a holistic approach at all times, for the successful development and execution of strategy. Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes.&lt;ref name="FEAPO"&gt;Federation of EA Professional Organizations, ''[http://feapo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Common-Perspectives-on-Enterprise-Architecture-v15.pdf Common Perspectives on Enterprise Architecture]'', ''Architecture and Governance Magazine'', Issue 9-4, November 2013 (2013). Retrieved on November 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a formalized	practice the field has its roots in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Greefhorst, Danny]], &amp; [[Proper, Erik]]. (2009). "Enterprise Engineering: Architecture Principles - The Cornerstones of Enterprise Architecture." In: [[Jan L.G. Dietz]], Erik Proper &amp; [[José Tribolet]] (Eds.), ''Architecture Principles the Cornerstones of Enterprise Architecture.'' (Vol. 4th). Heidelberg: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and its development has led to many "definitions, perspectives, and schools of thought surrounding Enterprise Architecture."&lt;ref name="FEAPO"/&gt; The main results the enterprise architecture practice can deliver are listed as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* An articulation of the strategic requirements of the enterprise 
* Models of the future state, which illustrate what the enterprise should look like across all EA viewpoints in support of the business strategy 
* A road map of the change initiatives required to reach that future state 
* The requirements, principles, standards and guidelines that will steer the implementation of change initiatives While these outputs are often&lt;ref name="FEAPO"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this paper the FEAPO wanted to provide "a high level description of Enterprise Architecture and what it can do for an organization, removing much of the jargon that often surrounds such efforts. It was written to provide insight into what Enterprise Architects do, what kind of skills are needed, and what results an organization should expect from their Enterprise Architecture efforts. Note that details of how to establish an Enterprise Architecture practice within your organization will be covered in a future paper."&lt;ref name="FEAPO"/&gt;

His father was a [[Catholic]] businessman who owned a factory which produced [[washing machine]]s and [[bicycle]]s. Gerard was the seventh child out of nine. On the verge of World War II, his father died of [[pneumonia]] and Gerard had to start help working at the age of 16 to earn money for his family.

==Career==
At the age of 24, after finishing school and serving in the army (part of which he spent in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]]), he dreamt of a future in [[car]]s and [[tourism|travel]]. He married Diane Provoost, whose father had a garage where he started his career as a [[salesman]]. He worked there for five years when he saw the first [[bus]]ses appear in the garage. In 1956, together with his brother-in-law, Roger Provoost, he started organizing bus travels during the summer months (when the buses stood idle) through ''Reiskantoren Royal Tours'' for [[United Kingdom|British]] tourists visiting the Belgian coast. In addition he started offering tours for [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s to the English coast across the [[English Channel]].

In 1958, with the [[Expo '58|Brussels World’s Fair]] came the breakthrough and in addition he started offering journeys to [[Lourdes]], [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] and the [[Costa Brava]]. At the end of the sixties, he was the first Belgian tour operator who offered organised air travel in association with [[Sabena]] to [[Benidorm]] (Spain). For many years he would be known  as ''Mijnheer Benidorm ''(Mister Benidorm) as he discovered Benidorm as a vacation resort during the sixties. In 1970, he opened his own Hotel Belroy in Benidorm and until 1978 would remain the only Belgian tour operator who offered flight vacations to Benidorm. In 1996, he sold Jetair to the German travel organization [[TUI AG|Touristik Union International (TUI)]].

During his last years, Brackx occupied himself with the [[real estate]] of the family holding Immobra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerard Brackx |url=http://trends.knack.be/economie/archief-trends/widget-1184709444473.htm?articleID=206138# |newspaper=Trends/Cash |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215092636/http://trends.knack.be/economie/archief-trends/widget-1184709444473.htm?articleID=206138 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Ostend on 19 September 2011, aged 80 and was buried there on 24 September.

'''Hasib Sabbagh''' ({{lang-ar|حسيب الصباغ}}), (also spelled '''Hassib''') (1920 – 12 January 2010) was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] businessman, activist, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=Bloomberg|title=Hasib Sabbagh, 90, Middle East construction firm owner, dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011404526.html|website=The Washington Post|date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and education ==
Sabbagh came from a [[Palestinian Christian]] family in [[Safed]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], although he was born in [[Tiberias]]. He graduated from the [[Arab College of Jerusalem]] in 1938, and in 1941 gained a civil engineering degree from the [[American University of Beirut]].

Sabbagh attended the Government Arab College of Jerusalem, which only the top public school students in Palestine attended. It was headed by Ahmad Samih al-Khalidi and staffed by some of the finest teachers in the Arab world. It was a boarding school with regimental discipline, where the highest standards were set for the students. They were expected to study night and day, and were allowed only one day off for sports and other recreation. It was there that he established some of the friendships that have lasted to this day.

In 1938 Sabbagh enrolled at the American University of Beirut, as a sophomore, in the college of engineering; attending AUB was to be one of the more significant experiences of his life. Not only was he being trained for his future profession, but he was also exposed to a rich and varied political life. AUB students came from throughout the Arab world, and represented many political currents: there were the Syrian nationalists, followers of [[Antun Sa'adeh]], the communists led by Khalid Bikdash, the Arab nationalists whose ideologue was Professor Constantine Zureik of AUB, and the Arab Ba‘thists who adhered to Michel ‘Aflaq’s ideas.

Sabbagh died on 12 January 2010 after a long illness.

== Work as an Activist and Mediator ==
In 1970, Sabbagh met [[Yasser Arafat]], chairman of the PLO, at the house of a mutual friend, Abdul Majid Shoman, in Beirut. Since that time, he developed a close relationship with Arafat and other members of the PLO leadership. Sabbagh, Basel Aql, and Walid Khalidi became intermediaries between the PLO and the Lebanese government, trying to inform and explain the complexity of Lebanese confessional politics to Arafat and his colleagues and interceding on behalf of Palestinian refugees with the Lebanese authorities. It was the Lebanese civil war, however, that made Sabbagh an activist &amp;mdash; an activist for peace and reconciliation between the various Lebanese parties and between the Palestinians and the Lebanese.

Sabbagh recognized the danger of the situation in Lebanon when, in April 1975, twenty-six Palestinians were shot to death by Phalangist forces in ‘Ayn al-Rumanah, in retaliation for the assassination of two of their bodyguards. The next day, he met with Abu Iyad, the PLO’s second in command, at [[Walid Khalidi]]’s house. The Palestinian leadership had also understood the potential threat to Lebanese &amp;mdash; Palestinian relations this incident portended. Abu Iyad asked Sabbagh to convince the Maronite patriarch, Antonius Butrus Khraysh, to condemn the killing publicly in order to preempt a further deterioration of the situation. Sabbagh, accompanied by a member of the Phalangist party, visited the patriarch, who agreed to make a statement on the radio that same evening condemning the killings. Sabbagh also asked the patriarch to invite both Pierre Gemayel, the leader of the Phalangist party, and Arafat for lunch at the patriarchate to effect a reconciliation between them and their communities. The invitation was accepted by Gemayel, but Arafat declined, saying that it was too soon after the ‘Ayn al-Rumanah killings to meet with Gemayel. Sabbagh strongly believed that had that meeting occurred between the two leaders at the onset of the conflict, it may have prevented much of the bloodshed and disaster that took place in the following days, months, and even years. Sabbagh was involved in many other efforts to bring leaders of the various factions together in order to resolve conflicts or prevent their escalation.
 
Throughout the war, Sabbagh acted as intermediary and mediator, trying to find solutions to the conflict that was destroying the country. He passed messages from the PLO to the United States administration and back to the PLO (although he was not the only channel that Arafat used to communicate with the United States). In 1982, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sabbagh accompanied by Munib al-Masri and Abdul Majid Shoman, went to Saudi Arabia to ask King Khalid to intercede with the United States in an effort to stop Israel’s bombing of Beirut, to allow the PLO to leave the city. When the bombing stopped, Sabbagh was instrumental in passing information from the PLO to the United States about the PLO’s conditions for its peaceful departure from Beirut.

A longtime member of both the [[Palestine National Council]] and of its central council, Sabbagh provided crucial international contacts for Arafat during the 1970s and 1980s. Most controversially, his 1978 meeting with the Phalange, first agreed to and then denounced by Arafat, provoked condemnation from the Lebanese and Syrian governments as well as from Palestinian opposition groups. In 1988, his active support encouraged Arafat to steer the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] firmly toward a renewed peace initiative.

== Consolidated Contractors Company ==
In 1943, with four other contractors, he established the [[Consolidated Contractors Company]] (CCC) in Haifa. Sabbagh left Palestine in April 1948 and moved to [[Lebanon]]. CCC was reestablished there in 1950, becoming the region's largest multinational and one of the largest contractors worldwide. Sabbagh was a billionaire and ranked 16th on the world's richest Arabs.{{when|date=May 2010}}

== Philanthropy ==
Through the [[Diana Sabbagh Foundation]], one of the largest Arab charitable foundations, Sabbagh has supported institutions of higher education across the Arab world and the West, and has influenced a range of dialogue initiatives, notably in the [[United States]] at the Council on Foreign Relations, the [[Carter Center]], and the Center for Muslim - Christian Encounter, and in Palestine within the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH), under [[Hanan Ashrawi]]. He also co-founded the Welfare Association for Palestinians, chaired the Palestinian Students Fund, and has been on the boards of the Arab Bank and of many academic institutions and pro-Palestinian think tanks, such as the [[Institute of Palestine Studies]].

and IGOPP's books deal with the financial market, mining royalties, [[executive compensation]], "good governance" in the public or private sector, takeovers of listed companies, regulation of financial markets, Davos, the presence of women on boards and many other themes relevant to governance. These books are constantly looking to provide a measured opinion, sensitive to others', by formulating policy proposals that respect the rights of the parties.

'''Intangible property''', also known as '''incorporeal property''', describes something which a [[Natural person|person]] or [[corporation]] can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/[[intellectual property]].  It generally refers to statutory creations such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, or [[patent]]s.  It excludes tangible property like [[real property]] (land, buildings, and [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) and [[personal property]] (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.).  In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as ''choses in action''.  [https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles Intangible] property is used in distinction to [[tangible property]].  It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred).  Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary [[extinguishment]] and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.

Generally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles|title=What are intangibles? {{!}} RoyaltyRange|website=www.royaltyrange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright.  However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights.  For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.

In [[English law]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in ''pure intangibles'' (such as debts, intellectual property rights and [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]) and ''documentary intangibles'', which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a [[bill of lading]], [[promissory note]] or [[bill of exchange]]).  The recent rise of [[electronic document]]s has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludovicus Stornebrink''' (sometimes written as ''Ludowicus'' and also known as ''Louis Stornebrink''), was the founder of the Yokohama Ice Works in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]]. Stornebrink was born on March 15, 1847 in [[Rotterdam]], [[The Netherlands]] and moved to Japan at an early age. In 1879 he became the founder and owner of the Yokohama Ice Works, Yokohama's first [[ice factory]].

Stornebrink married a Japanese wife, Hana Ohta, and they had three children. 
Stornebrink died on September 17, 1917 and is buried, together with his wife, who died the following year, at [[Foreign cemeteries in Japan#Yokohama|the Foreign General Cemetery]] in Yokohama. His sister, Gertrude Stornebrink (Feb 21st, 1851- September 1923) is buried in the same grave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7267">'''Management fad''' is a term used to characterize a change in philosophy or operations implemented by a business or institution.

The term is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and tends to be used in a [[pejorative]] sense, as it implies that such a change is being implemented (often '''''by''''' [[management]] '''''on''''' its [[employee]]s, with little or no input from them) solely because it is (at the time) "popular" within managerial circles, and not necessarily due to any real need for organizational change.  The term further implies that once the underlying philosophy is no longer "popular", it will be replaced by the newest "popular" idea, in the same manner and for the same reason as the previous idea.

Several authors have argued that new management ideas should be subject to greater critical analysis, and for the need for greater conceptual awareness of new ideas by managers.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. and Michael E. Raynor, "Why Hard-Nosed Executives Should Care About Management Theory," ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 81, No. 9, Sept. 2003, pp. 66-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors Leonard J. Ponzi and Michael Koenig believe that a key determinant of whether any management idea is a "management fad" is the number and timing of published articles on the idea.  In their research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://informationr.net/ir/8-1/paper145.html Ponzi, Leonard J. and Michael Koenig, "Knowledge Management: Another Management Fad?," ''Information Research'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Oct. 2002, paper no. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ponzi and Koenig argue that once an idea has been discussed for around 3–5 years, if after this time the number of articles on the idea in a given year decreases significantly (similar to the right-hand side of a bell curve), then the idea is most likely a "management fad".

==Common characteristics==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Management fads are often characterized by the following:
*New [[jargon]] for existing business processes.
*External [[consultants]] who specialize in the implementation of the fad.
*A ''[[certification]]'' or ''appraisal'' process performed by an external agency for a fee.
*Amending the [[job title]]s of existing employees to include references to the fad.
*Claims of a measurable business improvement via measurement of a [[metric system|metric]] (e.g. [[key performance indicator]]) that is defined by the fad itself.
*An internal sponsoring department or individual that gains influence due to the fad's implementation.
*Big words and complex phrases ([[puffery]]).

==Examples==
The following [[management theory|management theories]] and practices appeared on a list of management fashions and fads compiled by [[Adrian Furnham]],&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, Adrian, ''Management and Myths: Challenging Business Fads, Fallacies and Fashions'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, U.K., 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who arranged them in rough chronological order by their date of appearance, 1950s to 1990s:

*[[Management by objectives]]
*[[Matrix management]]
*[[Theory Z]]
*[[The One Minute Manager|One-minute management]]
*[[Management by wandering around]]
*[[Total quality management]]
*[[Business process reengineering]]
*[[Delayering]]
*[[Empowerment]]
*[[360-degree feedback]]
*[[Business process reengineering|Re-engineering]]
*[[Teamwork]]

Other theories and practices which observers have tagged as fads include:

* the tendency to replace every occurrence of "data" in compound managerial terminology with "information", see e.g. [[information integration]] vs. [[data integration]]
* [[Knowledge management]]&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;[http://Informationr.net/ir/8-1/paper144.html Wilson, T.D., "The Nonsense of 'Knowledge Management'," ''Information Research'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Oct. 2002, paper no. 144.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Fletcher Allen''' (November 28, 1842 – May 24, 1927) was a [[Vermont]] banker, businessman, farmer and politician who served one term as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Vermont|Lieutenant Governor]].

==Early life==
Martin Fletcher Allen was born in [[Ferrisburgh, Vermont|North Ferrisburgh, Vermont]] on November 28, 1842.  He attended [[Eastman Business College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] and became a merchant and store owner.

==Political involvement==
A Republican, Allen served in the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] from 1882 to 1883 and the [[Vermont Senate]] from 1890 to 1891. He was elected Vermont's Lieutenant Governor in 1900 and served until 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8eAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA230&amp;dq=martin+allen+ferrisburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o5v-TtKmOaXa0QHXpejgDw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20allen%20ferrisburgh&amp;f=false Magazine article, Republican nominees], The Vermonter magazine, July 1900, page 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeV6r-D7w9oC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=martin+allen+ferrisburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJz-Tq6GIefk0QH5-tCdCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20allen%20ferrisburgh&amp;f=false Vermont: The Green Mountain State], by Walter Hill Crockett, Volume 4, 1921, page 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011635/http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/elect/results1/pdf/stoff2ltgov.pdf General Election results, Lieutenant Governor, 1813–2008], Office of the Vermont Secretary of State, State Archives and Records Administration, 2008, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal trial==
In May 1901 Allen was one of several officers of the Farmers' National Bank who were arrested and accused of being complicit in embezzlement by the bank's Cashier. The officers of the bank were tried in 1902 and found not guilty, while the Cashier was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/05/28/118464813.pdf Newspaper article, Vermont Official Arrested], New York Times, May 28, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/771287672.html?dids=771287672:771287672&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+28%2C+1901&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=ARREST+HIGH+OFFICIAL&amp;pqatl=google Arrest High Official: Lieut.

==Retirement and death==
After leaving office Allen resumed his business pursuits, remaining active until complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] caused him to withdraw from active pursuits, after which he lived in retirement in North Ferrisburgh.  Allen died in North Ferrisburgh on May 24, 1927.  He was buried in North Ferrisburgh Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Death Records, 1909–2008, Record for Martin F.

According to [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and co-authors he was also suspected of participation in [[Russian apartment bombings]] in 1999, along with other crimes including [[murder]]s and [[kidnapping]]s.

Maxim Lazovsky was born in [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]]. In 1992, Lazovsky organized a gang that was linked to the [[Chechen mafia|Chechen criminal groups]] which tried to control oil business in the neighbouring regions. Lazovsky was co-owner of the firm Lanako, engaged in oil business. In the same firm worked Captain Andrey Shchelenkov, who died from an explosion of his own bomb on a railway bridge in Moscow on November 18, 1994. Colonel Vladimir Vorobyev, who shortly after organized another act of terrorism in Moscow: the explosion of a trolleybus in December 1994, also cooperated closely with Lazovsky.

In February 1996, Lazovsky was detained by the Moscow Criminal Investigation department (MUR) and accused of various criminal activities together with the Moscow FSB employee Alexey Jumashkin and six other FSB employees. In 1997 Lazovsky was convicted to two years for illegal possession of drugs and weapons. He was released in 1998.

According to [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]], Lavosky was involved in staging [[Russian apartment bombings|bombings in Moscow in 1999]].&lt;ref name="Assassins"&gt;[[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] ''The Age of Assassins. The Rise and Rise of Vladimir Putin'', Gibson Square Books, London, 2008, {{ISBN|1-906142-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2000, Lazovsky was shot by unknown assassins on the entryway of a church in the village of Uspenskoye, [[Odintsovsky District]] near Moscow, where he lived.

'''Microtargeting''', often used by [[political party|political parties]] and [[election campaign]]s includes [[direct marketing]] [[datamining]] techniques that involve predictive [[market segmentation]] (aka [[cluster analysis]]). It is used by the [[United States]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political parties, as well as candidates to track individual voters and identify potential supporters. The term "microtargeting" was coined in 2002 by political consultant Alexander P. Gage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/ How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theaapc.org/about-us/board-of-directors/alex-gage/ ALEXANDER P. GAGE&lt;/ref&gt;

They use various means of communication such as direct mail, phone calls, home visits, television, radio, web advertising, email, and text messaging, among others,to communicate with voters, crafting messages to build support for fundraising, campaign events, volunteering, and eventually to turn them out to the polls on the [[election]] day. Microtargeting's tactics rely on transmitting a tailored message to a subgroup of the electorate on the basis of unique information about that subgroup.

==History==
Although some of the tactics of microtargeting had been used in [[California]] since 1992, it really started to be used nationally only in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]].&lt;ref name="Vander Veen"&gt;Chad Vander Veen, Zeroing In, [http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php/97723 www.govtech.net, Jan 2, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014132950/http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php/97723 |date=2006-10-14 }}, accessed November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, [[Karl Rove]], along with [[Blaise Hazelwood]] at the [[Republican National Committee]], used it to reach voters in 18 states that [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] reelection campaign was not able to reach by other means. The results were greater contacts with likely Bush voters. For example, in [[Iowa]] the campaign was able to reach 92% of eventual Bush voters (compared to 50% in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]) and in [[Florida]] it was able to reach 84% (compared to 50% in 2000).&lt;ref name="Dreazen"&gt;[[Yochi Dreazen|Yochi J. Dreazen]], Democrats, Playing Catch-Up, Tap Database to Woo Potential Voters, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 31, 2006, A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this pioneering work was done by [[Alex Gage]] and his firm, TargetPoint Consulting.

Democrats did limited microtargeting in 2004, with some crediting microtargeting for Kerry's win in Iowa in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, T: ''New Math: How a trio of savvy Kerry campaign workers used a fresh voter equation to win Iowa.'', web only. American Prospect, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some news accounts credited Republican superiority in that area for victories in that election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kettle, "How Democrats missed the vote", ''The Guardian'', November 3, 2006 [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/martin_kettle/2006/11/better_policies_or_better_micr.html], accessed February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats later developed microtargeting capabilities for the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 election cycle]].&lt;ref name="Vander Veen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt; "It's no secret that the other side [Republicans] figured this out a little sooner", said Josh Syrjamaki, director of the Minnesota chapter of [[America Votes]] in October 2006. "They've had four to six years' jump on us on this stuff...but we feel like we can start to catch up."&lt;ref name="Balz"&gt;Dan Balz, Democrats Aim to Regain Edge In Getting Voters to the Polls, ''Washington Post'', October 8, 2006, accessed November 7, 2006. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/07/AR2006100700388.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], [[Cambridge Analytica]] played a role in first promoting [[Ted Cruz]] and, eventually, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/trump-calls-in-brexit-experts-to-target-voters-pf0hwcts9|title=Data scientists target 20 million new voters for Trump|author=Rhys Blakely|date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the claims of Cambridge Analytica's influence, made by its managers, have not been proven, and Cruz's opponent [[Ben Carson]] was ultimately unsuccessful even though he, too, involved Cambridge Analytica in his campaign.&lt;ref name="20161206spiegel"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Microtargeting is a modification of a practice used by commercial direct marketers. It would not be possible on a large scale without the development of large and sophisticated [[database]]s that contain data about as many voters as possible. The database essentially tracks voter habits in the same ways that companies like [[Visa (company)|Visa]] track consumer spending habits. The [[Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee's]] database is called [[Voter Vault]]. The Democratic National Committee effort is called VoteBuilder.&lt;ref name="VoteBuilder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/dnc-holds-national-training-as-it-rolls-ut-new-oter-file-2007-08-15.html|work=The Hill|title=DNC holds national training as it rolls out new voter file|date=August 15, 2007|author=Aaron Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel Democratic effort is being developed by [[Catalist]], a $9 million initiative headed by [[Harold M. Ickes|Harold Ickes]],&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt; while the leading non-partisan database is offered by [[Aristotle, Inc.|Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Aristotle" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/12/aristotle200712|work=Vanity Fair|title=Big Brother Inc.|date=December 3, 2007|author=James Verini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The databases contain specific information about a particular voter (party affiliation, frequency of voting, contributions, volunteerism, etc.) with other activities and [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] available from commercial [[data brokers]] such as [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]], Experian Americas, and [[InfoUSA]]. Such personal information is a "product" sold to interested companies. These data are particularly illuminating when portrayed through a [[geographic information system]] (GIS), where trends based on location can be mapped alongside dozens or hundreds of other variables. This geographic depiction also makes it ideal for volunteers to visit potential voters (armed with lists in hand, laid out in the shortest route—much like how [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] pre-determine delivery routes).

These databases are then [[datamining|mined]] to identify issues important to each voter and whether that voter is more likely to identify with one party or another. Political information is obviously important here, but consumer preferences can play a role as well. Individual voters are then put into groups on the basis of sophisticated computer modeling. Such groups have names like "Downscale Union Independents", "Tax and Terrorism Moderates," and "Older Suburban Newshounds."&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balz" /&gt;

Once a multitude of voting groups is established according to these criteria and their minute political differences, then the tailored messages can be sent via the appropriate means. While political parties and candidates once prepared a single television advertisement for general broadcast nationwide, it is now not at all uncommon to have several dozen variations on the one message, each with a unique and tailored message for that small demographic sliver of the voting public. This is the same for radio advertisement, direct mail, email, as well as stump speeches and fundraising events.

'''Nelson Iván Serrano Sáenz''' (born September 15, 1938) is a former [[Ecuador]]ian businessman and a naturalized American citizen (since 1971) who was convicted of [[mass murder|murdering]] Frank Dosso, Diane Patisso, George Patisso, and George Gonsalves in the town of [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]], [[Polk County, Florida]], on December 3, 1997. The [[jury trial|jury]] pronounced him guilty and recommended the [[death penalty]] for Serrano in October 2006 after he was convicted of the murders. On June 26, 2007, Judge Susan Roberts sentenced him to [[Death penalty|death]] by [[lethal injection]] for each of these crimes.

==Background==
On December 3, 1997, Frank Dosso, Diane Patisso, George Patisso, and George Gonsalves were found shot [[execution]]-style at the Erie Manufacturing plant in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]. Diane Patisso, a young state prosecutor, had gone to pick up her brother Frank and her husband George at the factory that evening, and prosecutors say she was murdered to prevent her from identifying the killer.

Although there was no clear physical evidence at the scene to link anyone to the crime, relatives of the victims immediately suspected Nelson Serrano, a former partner and CEO in the business, who had been in a bitter dispute with the others over the removal of $1 million by his partners without his knowledge. Dosso and Gonsalves accused Serrano of [[Graft (politics)|graft]], then [[theft]] but investigators, including the FBI, dismissed these accusations. However, millions of dollars were removed from corporate bank accounts after Serrano left the company and only Dosso and Gonsalves had access to them. The whereabouts of this money was never presented during trial and remains unknown.

There were disagreements about the distribution of assets and accusations by Serrano that there were two sets of books. During the summer of 1997, Nelson Serrano opened a separate business checking account with a different bank and deposited two checks totaling over $200,000 from Erie's sister company Garment Conveyor Systems, as requested by corporate counsel to keep monies safe from Dosso and Gonsalves. Serrano instituted a civil suit against his partners. Ultimately, Serrano was removed as president by a vote of the other two partners and Serrano left the companies. Thereafter, the locks were changed on the building. Shortly before Serrano was ousted as CEO, Phil Dosso and George Gonsalves had fired Serrano’s son, Francisco. Prosecutors said Serrano was angry because Gonsalves and Felice "Phil" Dosso, the third partner in the business, had ousted him and his son from both companies.

Numerous Erie employees testified to the strained relations between Serrano and the other two partners, particularly Serrano‘s dislike of Gonsalves. Serrano made statements indicating that he wished Gonsalves were deceased. Another Erie employee testified to the time, weeks before the murders, that a plant employee came to work with a gun and threatened to kill George. He was calmed down and sent home.

Authorities said both Serrano men had motive to commit the murders, but Francisco Serrano provided an alibi. His father told authorities he was in an Atlanta hotel room with a migraine headache all day, so no one saw him or talked to him. But, almost three years later, law enforcement agents found his fingerprint on a parking garage receipt at [[Orlando International Airport]] dated 3:49 p.m. on Dec. 3, about two hours before the slayings occurred. Prosecutors felt that piece of evidence broke his alibi. However, the state's own fingerprint expert stated the fingerprint was suspicious because of how it was found, because the print was from Serrano's right hand (a driver is more likely to take the ticket from the machine with his left hand), and because there were no other prints or smudges on the ticket.

Prosecutors have admitted, in a court hearing in September 2013, to withholding from defense counsel the testimony of the only eyewitness to the murder scene, John Purvis. Purvis stated that he witnessed an Asian young man ("one of those slanty eyed people") between the ages of 25-30 outside of the main entrance to Erie and a Latin young man in the building looking out of the glass at or around the time investigators estimate the murders occurred. The victims were found in an office about 50 feet away from the main entrance, suggesting that others were also involved. He also stated that a Lincoln or Cadillac was parked outside. The new attorneys for Serrano headed by attorney Roy Black have also uncovered that prosecutors withheld from trial defense attorneys the fact that an extradition process had already begun one week prior to Serrano's illegal deportation and, furthermore, state attorney Paul Wallace traveled to Ecuador, misled government officials to seek deportation obstructing the federal process of extradition. Paul Wallace, as co-prosecutor during the trial, withheld from the court and the jury this information.

Serrano claimed that he was on a business trip, 500 miles away in [[Atlanta]], when the killings occurred.  However, the [[prosecutor]]s convinced the [[jury trial|12-member trial jury]] that Serrano had flown by [[airliner]] to Florida under [[pseudonym|assumed name]]s to commit the [[premeditated murder]]s, and then he had quickly flown back to Atlanta from a different major airport, in order to attempt to establish an [[alibi]] by appearing on the security video cameras of his hotel.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-catch-a-killer-01-03-2007/&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors stated that Serrano had tricked his nephew into providing him with a rental car (under a [[pseudonym]]) to reach the other airport. Although Bartow is midway between the major airports in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], evidence was not shown to positively prove this trip and murders could be possible during rush hour traffic. Prosecutors and investigators did not find any videos from either airport showing Serrano.

During the trial, Serrano's lawyers fought for a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]], claiming that Serrano was illegally [[deportation|deported]] from [[Ecuador]] to the United States. Serrano is an [[Ecuador]]ian citizen by birth and a naturalized American citizen (in 1971). At the time in 1971, he had to renounce his Ecuadorian citizenship in order to obtain his United States citizenship. Serrano was kidnapped in Ecuador by Florida-hired off-duty police officers and then, according to the Ecuadorian government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (a division of the Organization of American States), illegally deported back to Florida for his murder trial. Documents concerning this issue were presented during trial and were confirmed by the Ecuadorian Ombudsman through his testimony.  Judge Roberts, who was not aware that an extradition process was started and thwarted by state attorney Wallace, denied the defense motion, finding no cause to dismiss the case.

Ecuadorian officials, seeking his return to that country, claimed Serrano had been beaten and kept in a [[dog kennel]] at the airport in Quito after his arrest in Ecuador. Police say Serrano received a minor injury from a fall as he boarded the airliner. An American Airlines flight attendant who witnessed Serrano was bleeding from the head with several bruises refused entry to the Florida officials but the flight Captain allowed them to board. 

Judge Roberts denied a defense motion for a change of venue although one of the victims, Diane Dosso Patisso, was an Assistant State Attorney for Polk County. The judge hid this information from the jury.

The families of the victims have set up a memorial foundation in their honor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-George-Diane-Patisso-and-Frank-Dosso-Memorial-Foundation/114728435263755&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Serrano's son, who had also worked at the Bartow plant, claims that his father is innocent, and he has set up a [http://www.nelsonserrano.org web site] in defense of his father.

Serrano is on death row at a male-only maximum security facility at the Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, Florida. convicted of four counts of premeditated murder, awaiting four administrations of death by lethal injection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19187">[[File:Burma 1926 Promissory Note.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A 1926 promissory note from the [[Imperial Bank of India]], Rangoon, Burma for 20,000 [[rupee]]s plus [[interest]]]]

A '''promissory note''', sometimes referred to as a '''note payable''', is a [[legal instrument]] (more particularly, a [[financial instrument]] and a [[debt]] instrument), in which one party (the ''maker'' or ''issuer'') promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of [[money]] to the other (the ''payee''), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms.

==Overview==
The terms of a note usually include the [[:wikt:principal|principal]] amount, the [[interest rate]] if any, the parties, the date, the terms of repayment (which could include interest) and the [[maturity date]].  Sometimes, provisions are included concerning the payee's rights in the event of a [[default (finance)|default]], which may include [[foreclosure]] of the maker's assets. For loans between individuals, writing and signing a promissory note are often instrumental for tax and record keeping. A promissory note alone is typically unsecured.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Use a Promissory Note|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/promissory_note.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term note payable is commonly used in [[accounting]] (as distinguished from [[accounts payable]]) or commonly as just a "note", it is internationally defined by the ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'', but regional variations exist. A [[banknote]] is frequently referred to as a promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. [[Mortgage note]]s are another prominent example.

If the promissory note is unconditional and readily saleable, it is called a [[negotiable instrument]].&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;Whaley DJ. (2012). [http://wsulawreview.org/DWhaley.pdf Mortgage Foreclosures, Promissory Notes, and the Uniform Commercial Code]. ''Western State University Law Review''. [https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=39+W.+St.+U.+L.+Rev.+313&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=b4ff3146a501f1f969b427ea9ebfba75 LexisNexis entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demand promissory notes''' are notes that do not carry a specific maturity date, but are due on demand of the lender. Usually the lender will only give the borrower a few days' notice before the payment is due.

Promissory notes may be used in combination with [[security agreement]]s. For example, a promissory note may be used in combination with a [[mortgage law|mortgage]], in which case it is called a [[mortgage note]].

====Loan contracts====
In common speech, other terms, such as "[[loan]]", "[[loan agreement]]", and "loan contract" may be used interchangeably with "promissory note". The term "loan contract" is often used to describe a contract that is lengthy and detailed.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

A promissory note is very similar to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a promissory note is generally less detailed and less rigid than a loan contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp|title=Promissory Note|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|website=investopedia.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not.

====Difference from IOU====
Promissory notes differ from [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s in that they contain a specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beattie|first=Andrew|title=Promissory Notes: Not Your Average IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/promissory_note.asp|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOUs only acknowledge that a debt exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promissory Note Comparison Guide|url=https://www.legalzoom.com/sites/legalzoom.com/themes/legalzoom/assets/includes/Promissory-Note-Comparison-Guide.pdf|website=LegalZoom|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp|website=Investopedia|publisher=Investopedia, LLC|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiability===
[[Negotiable instrument]]s are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable instruments are subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the application of the [[holder in due course]] rule.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt; The negotiability of [[mortgage note]]s has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and "baggage" associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt;

In the United States, the Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/6-508-0668|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as financial instruments===
Promissory notes are a common financial instrument in many jurisdictions, employed principally for short time financing of companies. Often, the seller or provider of a service is not paid upfront by the buyer (usually, another company), but within a period of time, the length of which has been agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. The reasons for this may vary; historically, many companies used to balance their books and execute payments and debts at the end of each week or tax month; any product bought before that time would be paid only then. Depending on the jurisdiction, this [[Standard of deferred payment|deferred payment period]] can be regulated by law; in countries like [[France]], [[Italy]] or [[Spain]], it usually ranges between 30 and 90 days after the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesclesdelabanque.com/Web/Cdb/Entrepreneurs/Content.nsf/DocumentsByIDWeb/7PUHXY?OpenDocument|title=La lettre de change et la LCR|first=Les clés de la banque-|last=FBF|date=|website=Les clés de la banque Entrepreneurs|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a company engages in many of such transactions, for instance by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, it is possible that the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short-term loan, or using any other such short-term financial arrangements to avoid [[insolvency]]. However, in jurisdictions where promissory notes are commonplace, the company (called the ''payee'' or ''lender'') can ask one of its debtors (called the ''maker'', ''borrower'' or ''payor'') to ''accept'' a promissory note, whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the promissory note (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinkel|first1=Daniel F.|title=Essentials of Practical Real Estate Law|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133421490|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XoJAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lender can then take the promissory note to a financial institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the promissory note for cash; usually, the promissory note is cashed in for the amount established in the promissory note, less a small discount.

Once the promissory note reaches its ''maturity date'', its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount ''promised'' in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the promissory note in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured promissory notes, the lender accepts the promissory note based solely on the maker's ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured promissory note, the lender accepts the promissory note based on the maker's ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/promise.htm|title=SEC.gov - Broken Promises: Promissory Note Fraud|author=|date=|website=www.sec.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as private money===
Thus, promissory notes can work as a form of private money. In the past, particularly during the 19th century, their widespread and unregulated use was a source of great risk for banks and private financiers, who would often face the insolvency of both debtors, or simply be scammed by both.

Roman promissory notes may be the first ones as 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, promissory notes have acted as a form of privately issued [[currency]]. [[Flying cash]] or ''feiqian'' was a promissory note used during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907). Flying cash was regularly used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals.&lt;ref name="Origins of value"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William N. Goetzmann|author2=K.

According to tradition, in 1325 a promissory note was signed in [[Milan]]. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowiak, Marek. ''Dirhams for slaves''. Medieval Seminar, All Souls, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued promissory notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition=1st Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of promissory notes being issued in 1384 between [[Genoa]] and [[Barcelona]], although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d'Entença, a merchant from [[Huesca]] (then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]), amounting a total of 100 florins.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Manuel Sanchis Guarner in ''La Ciutat de València''. Ajuntament de València, València. Cinquena Edició 1989, plana 172. Quote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
{{cita|Onorables senyors, nosaltres havem pres ací en Monsó, C florins de cambi de mossén Manuel d'Entença..., vos plàcia complir e donar aquí en València, per ell al honrat En Bernat de Codinachs, vista la present. Per la lletra que us enviam, vos fem saber aquells havíem ops. Plàtia-us, senyors, aquest cambi aja bon compliment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases, the promissory notes were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. [[Strozzi family|Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi]] issued an early form of promissory note in [[Medina del Campo]] ([[Spain]]), against the city of [[Besançon]] in 1553.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La primera Letra de Cambio|url=http://www.delsolmedina.com/La%20primera%20letra%20de%20cambio.htm|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists notice of promissory notes being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.

===International law===
In 1930, under the League of Nations, a ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'' was drafted and ratified by eighteen  nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/09/9-03/bills-exchange-notes.xml|publisher=UiO|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;clang=_en|website=United Nations Treaty Collection|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=7 June 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 75 of the treaty stated that a promissory note shall contain:
* the term "''promissory note''" inserted in the body of the instrument and expressed in the language employed in drawing up the instrument
* an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money;
* a statement of the time of payment;
* a statement of the place where payment is to be made;
* the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be made;
* a statement of the date and of the place where the promissory note is issued;
* the signature of the person who issues the instrument (maker).

'''...'''

''' Promissory note defined

(1) A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified person or to bearer.

(2) An instrument in the form of a note payable to maker’s order is not a note within the meaning of this section unless and until it is indorsed by the maker.

(3) A note is not invalid by reason only that it contains also a pledge of collateral security with authority to sell or dispose thereof.

(4) A note which is, or on the face of it purports to be, both made and payable within the British Islands is an inland note. Any other note is a foreign note.'''}}

===United States===
[[File:Promissory note - 2nd Bank of US $1000.jpg|thumb|A promissory note issued by the [[Second Bank of the United States]], December 15, 1840, for the amount of $1,000]]
In the [[United States]], a promissory note that meets certain conditions is a [[negotiable instrument]] regulated by article 3 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. Negotiable promissory notes called [[mortgage note]]s are used extensively in combination with [[Mortgage law|mortgages]] in the financing of [[real estate]] transactions. One prominent example is the [[Fannie Mae]] model [[standard form contract]] Multistate Fixed-Rate Note 3200, which is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes|url=https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/notes|publisher=[[FannieMae]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promissory notes, or [[commercial paper]]s, are also issued to provide capital to businesses. However, Promissory Notes act as a source of Finance to the company's creditors.

The various State law enactments of the Uniform Commercial Code define what is and what is not a promissory note, in section 3-104(d):

{{cquote|'''§ 3-104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.'''

'''...'''

'''(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, a writing containing such a disclaimer removes such a writing from the definition of ''negotiable instrument'', instead simply memorializing a [[contract]].

Salinas de Gortari was included in a list of the "10 most corrupt Mexicans" published by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 Most Corrupt Mexicans Of 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2013/12/16/the-10-most-corrupt-mexicans-of-2013/#2715e4857a0b798dfe167a8c|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and imprisonment==
In February 1995, Raúl Salinas was arrested and charged with masterminding the murder of [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], the deputy leader of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] ruling party. Salinas was the former brother-in-law of Ruiz Massieu, who had been married to Raúl's sister Adriana.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1999, Salinas was found guilty and sentenced to 50 years in prison (later reduced to 27.5 years).&lt;ref&gt;Raul Salinas Guilty in Killing And Is Sentenced to 50 Years ''New York Times'' January 22, 1999 [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/22/world/raul-salinas-guilty-in-killing-and-is-sentenced-to-50-years.html?ref=topics]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, Salinas had his conviction overturned by a judicial panel and he was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Mexico Voids Conviction of Ex-President's Brother ''Los Angeles Times'' June 10, 2005 [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/10/world/fg-salinas10]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Carlos Salinas appointed Deputy Attorney General [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]], the brother of the assassinated man, to head the investigation of the murder.  However, after a few months he resigned, claiming senior PRI officials were blocking the investigation. Later, Ruiz Massieu fled the country, but was arrested in Newark, New Jersey on money-laundering charges. He died in September 1999, apparently by suicide.&lt;ref&gt; Mario Ruiz Massieu; As victim or perpetrator, he sank in a mire of murder, bribery and drug trafficking
''The Guardian'' September 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/20/guardianobituaries1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged money laundering==

In November 1995, Raúl Salinas's wife, [[Paulina Castañón]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Castañón]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] after attempting to withdraw $84 million USD from an account owned by Raúl under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and summing to hundreds of millions of dollars even though he never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the US [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Raúl Salinas transferred over $90 million out of Mexico and into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland, through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994, all with the help of [[Citibank]] and its affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf |title=PRIVATE BANKING: Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering |author=United States General Accounting Office |authorlink=Government Accountability Office |date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Raúl Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The bank accounts were held at [[Pictet &amp; Cie]], Citibank Zurich, [[Julius Baer]] Bank, and [[Banque privée Edmond de Rothschild]] in Geneva and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/news/reformaprison.html |title=He put his trust in Switzerland and Citibank |last=Rodriguez Reyna |first=Ignacio |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan, David C.|title=Drug Politics: Dirty Money and Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WK2HvMBKj4MC|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3174-0 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amleurope.org/materials/reference_Materials/Switzerlands%2012-Year%20Probe%20of%20Salinas%20Wnds%20with%20$74%20Million%20Payment%20to.pdf |title=Switzerland's 12-Year Probe of Salinas Ends with $74 Million Payment |publisher=[[Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists]]}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other funds were returned to third parties, including Mexican billionaire [[Carlos Peralta Quintero]], who had given the funds to Raúl Salinas to set up an investment company. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds.&lt;ref name="swissinfo" /&gt;  However, in July 2013 a court exonerated Salinas of "unjust enrichment" and ordered that 224 million pesos (approximately $18 million) and 41 properties be returned to him.  The court said that it could not explain how Salinas accumulated such wealth, but said that "so long as it is not shown that the assets acquired by public employee Raul Salinas de Gortari are proceeds derived from an abuse of his position," that he cannot be convicted of "unjust enrichment."&lt;ref&gt;Symbol of impunity: Raúl Salinas the "Inconvenient Relative" of President Carlos Salinas ''Borderline Beat'' August 5, 2013 [http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/08/symbol-of-impunity-raul-salinas.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2004, [[Enrique Salinas]] de Gortari, the brother of Raúl Salinas de Gortari, was found dead in his car after apparently having been beaten and strangled. Prosecutors said that Enrique Salinas had been sought for questioning by French police regarding his financial transactions with Raúl Salinas. However, investigators indicated that they thought the killing was a botched extortion attempt on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salinas Killing Deepens the Family's Drama |first=James C., Jr. |last=McKinley |authorlink=James C.

==Biography==
Kuok was born on 6 October 1923,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Billionaires Index"/&gt; in the sugar business. Kuok's father arrived in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] from [[Fujian]], China, at the beginning of the 20th century, and Robert was the youngest of three brothers, born on 6 October 1923, in Johor Bahru. He grew up speaking his parents' Chinese Fuzhou dialect, English and Japanese during Japan's wartime occupation of Malaya. He was a student from [[Raffles Institution]] and [[English College Johore Bahru]].

He claims he began in business as an office boy, and later started a business with relatives' support.&lt;ref name="forsakes" /&gt; Upon graduation, being a [[collaborationist]] with the [[Empire of Japan]], he worked as a clerk in the rice-trading department of Japanese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsubishi]] Shoji Kaisha between the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] period between 1942 and 1945, in Singapore, a conglomerate which with the help of Japanese military unit monopolized the rice trade in Malaya during the occupation period. He was soon promoted to head the rice-trading department. After the war, he took the skills he learned from the Japanese back to the family's business in Johor.&lt;ref&gt;Annabelle R. Gambe. ''Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurship and Capitalist Development in Southeast Asia'', p 94. Lit Verlag Munster, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuok senior died in 1948, and Kuok and his two brothers and a cousin [[Kuok Hock Chin]] founded ''Kuok Brothers Sdn Bhd'' in 1949, trading agricultural commodities. Kuok relationship with the Japanese continued after Malaya gained independence. In 1959, Kuok formed Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Co. Bhd. together with two prominent Japanese partners. He also brought many influential Malay elite into his company as directors and shareholders which include UMNO politician and Malay royalty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In 1961, he made a coup by buying cheap sugar from India before the prices shot up. He continued to invest heavily in [[sugar refineries]], controlled 80% of the Malaysian sugar market with production of 1.5 million tonnes, equivalent to 10% of world production, and so earned his nickname "Sugar King of Asia".

In 1971, he built the first [[Shangri-La Hotel Singapore|Shangri-La Hotel]], in Singapore. His first foray into Hong Kong property was in 1977, when he acquired a plot of land on the newly reclaimed [[Tsim Sha Tsui East]] waterfront, where he built the second hotel, the [[Kowloon Shangri-La]]. In 1993, his Kerry Group acquired a 34.9% stake in the [[SCMP Group|South China Morning Post]] from [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]]. Kuok officially retired from the Kerry Group on 1 April 1993. 

His companies have investments in many countries, including Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, [[Mainland China]], Indonesia, Fiji and Australia. Businesses in China include 10 bottling companies for [[Coca-Cola]], and ownership of the [[The China World Trade Center|Beijing World Trade Centre]].&lt;ref name="forsakes" /&gt;

Freight interests include [[Malaysian Bulk Carriers|Malaysian Bulk Carriers Berhad]] and [[Transmile Air Services|Transmile Group]].

His political influence is attested by his having been selected as one of the [[Hong Kong Affairs Advisors]] in the run-up to the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]], and his minority stake in [[CITIC Pacific]]. He was also instrumental in conveying information and setting up the meetings between Malaysia and China governments leading to full diplomatic cross recognition of the two countries.

In 2007, Kuok combined his plantations, edible oil and grains businesses with Wilmar International, hence making it the world's biggest palm-oil processor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/robert-kuok-hock-nien/|title=Bloomberg Billionaires Index - Robert Kuok|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2009, PPB Group under the flagship of Robert Kuok issued a statement to the Bursa Malaysia that it had decided to dispose of its sugar units along with land used to cultivate sugar cane for RM 1.29 billion to [[FELDA]]. The sales resulted in a one-off gain for the company. The sugar unit and sugar cane plantation were the second largest business segment upon its grain and feed which were topping the sales.

In February 2014, Kuok's Singapore-based oil services company PACC Offshore Services Holdings (POSH) started pre-IPO talks with investors to list on the [[Singapore Stock Exchange]] to raise $400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuok-owned offshore firm in talks for $400m Singapore IPO|url=http://oilpatchasia.com/2014/02/kuok-owned-offshore-firm-in-talks-for-400m-singapore-ipo/|publisher=Oil Patch Asia|accessdate=5 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305105631/http://oilpatchasia.com/2014/02/kuok-owned-offshore-firm-in-talks-for-400m-singapore-ipo/|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuok lives in Deep Water Bay on Hong Kong island.

In May 2018, Kuok was appointed to the [[Council of Eminent Persons (Malaysia)|Council of Eminent Persons]] along with Tun [[Daim Zainuddin]], Tan Sri Datuk Seri [[Zeti Akhtar Aziz]], Tan Sri [[Mohd Hassan Merican]] and [[Jomo Kwame Sundaram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/whos-who-in-mahathirs-new-cabinet-and-council-of-elders|title=Who's who in Mahathir's new Cabinet and Council of Elders|first=|last=hermesauto|date=12 May 2018|website=straitstimes.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''safeguard''', in [[international law]], is a restraint on [[international trade]] or [[economic development]] to protect communities from [[development aggression]] or home industries from foreign [[competition]].

In the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), a member may take a safeguard action, such as restricting imports of a product temporarily to protect a domestic industry from an increase in imports causing or threatening to cause injury to domestic production.

In the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], safeguards are intended to protect [[indigenous peoples]] and other [[local communities]] with [[traditional knowledge]] of [[natural resource management]] within efforts towards [[reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= REDD Web Platform Safeguards|url=https://unfccc.int/methods/redd/redd_web_platform/items/7282.php |publisher=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO and UNFCCC concepts are related within international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= World Bank Safeguard Policies and the UNFCCC REDD+ Safeguards |url=https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/sites/fcp/files/2013/june2013/FMT%20Note%20CF-2013-3_FCPF%20WB%20Safeguard%20Policies%20and%20UNFCCC%20REDD%2B%20Safeguards_FINAL.pdf |publisher=Institute of Green Economy |issue= IGREC‐19:2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= A Guide to Understanding and Implementing the UNFCCC REDD+ Safeguards|url=http://www.clientearth.org/reports/a-guide-to-understanding-and-implementing-unfccc-redd+-safeguards.pdf |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= REDD: Addressing the Drivers – A case for the WTO?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/briefings/forests/2013/20130604-REDD-Drivers.pdf |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With UNFCC processes, safeguards became of concern in the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= The REDD Safeguards of Cancun |url=http://www.igrec.in/The_REDD_Safeguards_of_Cancun.pdf |publisher=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the WTO, safeguard measures were available under the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) (Article XIX). However, they were infrequently used, and some governments preferred to protect their industries by "grey area" measures ("voluntary" export restraint arrangements on products such as cars, steel and semiconductors). As part of the WTO deal, members gave up the "grey area" measures and adopted a specific WTO Safeguards Agreement [http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/safeg_e/safeg_e.htm] to discipline the use of safeguard measures.

Safeguards are usually seen as responses to economic development and trade processes that align with [[international law]], as opposed to negative practices, such as [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] or [[subsidies]].

In the context of world trade, they are supposed to be used only in very specific circumstances, with compensation, and on a universal basis. For example, a member restricting imports for safeguard purposes would have to restrict imports from all other countries. However, exceptions to the nondiscriminatory rule are provided for in the Agreement on Safeguards itself as well as in some [[ad hoc]] agreements. In the last respect, it is worthwhile to note that the [[People's Republic of China]] accepted that discriminatory safeguards may be imposed on its exports to other WTO members until 2013.

Regional trading arrangements have their own rules relating to safeguards. Some safeguard measures can be resorted to in the area of services, as provided for in the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4874">'''BDC Small Business Week''' is a national celebration of Canadian [[entrepreneurs]] and their contribution to [[Canada]]’s economy. The [[Business Development Bank of Canada]] (BDC) has been organizing Small Business Week  since 1979.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;Small Business Week's official website. https://www.bdc.ca/en/small-business-week/pages/about-small-business-week.html&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place every year during the third full week of October. Events held during the week bring together entrepreneurs—and prospective entrepreneurs—at conferences, workshops, luncheons and trade fairs across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Industry Canada. http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ich-epi.nsf/eng/02129.html&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to provide them with opportunities to learn, network, share ideas and socialize with their peers.&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;Toronto Star. https://www.thestar.com/business/smallbusiness/article/874675--what-is-small-business-week&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Small Business Week began in 1979 when the branches of the Federal Business Development Bank (as BDC was then known) in [[British Columbia]]’s Lower Fraser Valley organized a week of small business [[management]] training sessions for entrepreneurs. They called the initiative Small Business Week.
Employees in British Columbia repeated the experiment the following year and, in 1981, Small Business Week was officially launched nationwide.&lt;ref name="citation"&gt;Small Business Week’s official website. https://www.bdc.ca/en/small-business-week/pages/about-small-business-week.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Stevie Awards''' are a set of hundreds of business awards given annually by the American Business Awards organization. They were created in 2002 to recognize accomplishments and contributions of companies and business people worldwide. The 2002 awards were called ''The American Business Awards''; the 2003, ''The International Business Awards'', since then the present title has been used. Approximately 30-40% of entrants receive an award.

==History==
Michael P. Gallagher, an American businessman, conceived the Stevie Awards as a way to "restore public confidence and investor trust"&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|title = Fairfax Man Wants Stevie Trophy To Join Ranks of Tony and Oscar | first = Woodrow | last = Irvin | work = The Washington Post |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-250387.html | date = March 9, 2003| page = T27}} {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Enron scandal]] in 2001.  Gallagher left his job in 2001 and founded American Business Awards to administer the Stevies.{{cn|date=September 2018}} When launched in 2002, the awards were described by the ''[[New York Post]]'' as being intended to "distinguish the good guys from the scoundrels" during a period heightened scrutiny and distrust of managers and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Good Guy Awards for CEOs – Hoping 'Oscars' Will Keep Them in Line | first = Paul | last = Tharp | date = September 22, 2002 | work = The New York Post | page = 34 |url=https://nypost.com/2002/09/22/good-guy-awards-for-ceos-hoping-oscars-will-keep-them-in-line/ | quote = CEOs will get a new chance to clean up their image with the launch of the business world's own Oscar awards.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Stevies was awarded in 48 categories in April 2003&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellin |first=Abby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/business/private-sector-a-diogenes-of-wall-street-finds-executives-to-reward.html |title=A Diogenes of Wall Street Finds Executives to Reward |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 27, 2003 |accessdate=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judged by a panel including [[Rich Karlgaard]], the editor of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine and Richard Klimoski, Dean of the School of Management at [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; 

==Award ==
Stevie is taken from the name Stephen, which is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "crowned".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The charge to be considered for a Stevie in 2003 ranged from $200 to $400.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As of 2014, entry fees range up to $505.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevieawards.com/uploads/file/ABA14EntryFees.pdf|title=2014 AMERICAN BUSINESS AWARDS ENTRY FEES|publisher=Stevie Awards|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an additional fee for attending the awards dinner.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Awards are judged each year by figures in business worldwide who participate in an evaluation process of nominees. Their recommendations for winners are announced at annual awards ceremonies held in New York City and other locations.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

According to the organization, awards are given in hundreds of categories, and 30-40% of entrants receive an award.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/about/69_340_1416.cfm#Q25|title=FAQ|publisher=Stevie Awards|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/awards/70_816_3655.cfm|title=Categories - Stevie Awards|website=www.stevieawards.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, there were 14 main categories for which awards were given including: company/organization, customer service, human resources, IT, live event, management, marketing, mobile website &amp; app, new product, public relations, publications, support, video, and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevieawards.com/aba/2017-website-award-winners|title=2017 Website Award Winners - Stevie Awards|website=stevieawards.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudirman Central Business District''' or '''SCBD''' is a business district with an integrated mixed use development concept, located in [[South Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], consisting of condominiums, office buildings, hotels, shopping and entertainment centers. The total area of SCBD is about 45 hectare, which is again divided into 25 lots. About 13 hectares of the district are used to develop road network and landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scbd.com/|title=SCBD}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCBD is located within [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta]]. There are seven entry and exit points from SCBD to different avenues of Jakarta. Most of the office buildings in the district are connected by underground pedestrian links.
==Important buildings==

'''''The Poor Pay More''''' is a 1967 book published by [[David Caplovitz]]. It is a sociology study of what could be called the "[[poverty penalty]]", which is a concept that poor people pay more for the same goods and services as people with more money do.

[[Esther Peterson]] cited the book as being important for understanding contemporary consumer problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Charles S.|title=Do the poor pay more?|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=Jan 1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–24|jstor=1249191|publisher=American Marketing Association|doi=10.2307/1249191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a researcher cited the book as still being relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mierzwinski | first1 = E. | title = Colston E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21986">University '''technology transfer offices''' ('''TTOs'''), or '''Technology Licensing Offices''' ('''TLOs'''),  are responsible for [[technology transfer]] and other aspects of the commercialization of research that takes place in a university. TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothaermel|first=F.

While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.

== History ==
The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the [[science policy of the United States]].  The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which had coordinated large [[private-public partnership]] research projects as part of the war effort, including the [[Manhattan Project]].  Bush's answer was ''Science - the Endless Frontier''.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302a–302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Vannevar|title=Science the Endless Frontier|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund [[basic research]] at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university.  Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|date=2006-07-01|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=Property and the pursuit of knowledge: IPR issues affecting scientific research|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Maryann|last2=Desrochers|first2=Pierre|date=2003-03-01|title=Research Universities and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the History of the Johns Hopkins University|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.1080/1366271032000068078|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the [[Research Corporation]], while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Some universities, such as [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]], had active licensing programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard R|last3=Sampat|first3=Bhaven N|last4=Ziedonis|first4=Arvids A|date=2001-01-01|title=The growth of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities: an assessment of the effects of the Bayh–Dole act of 1980|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99–119|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00100-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices.  The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy.  The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.&lt;ref name=Mowery&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C.|last2=Sampat|first2=Bhaven N.|date=2004-12-01|title=The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and University–Industry Technology Transfer: A Model for Other OECD Governments?|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|language=en|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/s10961-004-4361-z|issn=0892-9912|citeseerx=10.1.1.1025.6800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_lrbivorytrade.pdf|title=Ivory Trade|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=11 September 2003|website=Harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:

=== Industry partnerships ===
An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=1998-12-01|title=The norms of entrepreneurial science: cognitive effects of the new university–industry linkages|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=27|issue=8|pages=823–833|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the "pull" method, in which TTOs ''receive'' interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the "push" method, in which TTOs actively ''seek'' industry partners for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4438&amp;context=flr|title=Interface: The Push and Pull of Patents|last=Lee|first=Peter|date=2009|website=Fordham Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property ===
The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek [[patent]] protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt; Universities typically [[License#Patent licensing|license]] the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Donald S|last2=Waldman|first2=David|last3=Link|first3=Albert|date=2003-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of organizational practices on the relative productivity of university technology transfer offices: an exploratory study|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counseling and incubation for startups ===

TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Shea|first=Rory P.|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Chevalier|first3=Arnaud|last4=Roche|first4=Frank|date=2005-09-01|title=Entrepreneurial orientation, technology transfer and spinoff performance of U.S. universities|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=The Creation of Spin-off Firms at Public Research Institutions: Managerial and Policy Implcations|volume=34|issue=7|pages=994–1009|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing resources, funding, and connections to [[University spin-off|university spin-off companies]], TTOs attempt to increase the chances of [[startup company|startup]] success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, many TTOs establish [[business incubator]]s and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rhonda G.|date=2002-08-01|title=Technology business incubators: how effective as technology transfer mechanisms?|url=|journal=Technology in Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299–316|doi=10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of such incubators and programs include the [[Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator]] as well as the [[Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator]] at [[Harvard University]], and [[Fab Lab MSI]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolympiris|first=Christos|last2=Klein|first2=Peter G.|date=2017-06-01|title=The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=145–170|doi=10.1002/sej.1242|issn=1932-443X|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/106979/1/WRAP-effects-academic-incubators-university-innovation-Kolympiris-2017.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and organization ==
The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brescia|first=F.|last2=Colombo|first2=G.|last3=Landoni|first3=P.|title=Organizational structures of Knowledge Transfer Offices: an analysis of the world's top-ranked universities|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=41|issue=1|pages=132–151|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9384-5|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in  multiple disciplines throughout the university.

TTOs can by classified into three different types:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* ''internal:'' existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration
* ''external:'' existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration
* ''mixed:'' having components of both internal and external TTOs 
As of 2012 the "internal" type was most common in the US.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategies ==
TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macho-Stadler|first=Inés|last2=Pérez-Castrillo|first2=David|last3=Veugelers|first3=Reinhilde|date=2007-06-01|title=Licensing of university inventions: The role of a technology transfer office|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=25|issue=3|pages=483–510|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lockett|first=Andy|last2=Wright|first2=Mike|last3=Franklin|first3=Stephen|title=Technology Transfer and Universities' Spin-Out Strategies|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1023/a:1022220216972|via=|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=Michael J|last2=Lee|first2=James N|date=2000-09-01|title=University revenues from technology transfer: Licensing fees vs. equity positions|url=|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=15|issue=5|pages=385–392|doi=10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== International diffusion &amp; TTOs outside the US ==
As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of "professor's privilege", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many [[OECD]] and [[European Union|EU]] nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geuna|first=Aldo|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|date=2011-10-01|title=Changes to university IPR regulations in Europe and the impact on academic patenting|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3753/1/3753.pdf|journal=Research Policy|series=Special Issue: 30 Years After Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1068–1076|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.008|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/benchmarking-industry-science-relationships_9789264175105-en|title=Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Countries such as  France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnstrand Damsgaard|first=E.|last2=Thursby|first2=M.

Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Tina|date=2010|title=Asian Initiatives on Bayh-Dole, with Special Reference to India: How Do We Make It More "Asian?"|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=ckjip|journal=Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|volume=10|pages=44–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mok|first=Ka Ho|title=The quest for an entrepreneurial university in East Asia: impact on academics and administrators in higher education|url=|journal=Asia Pacific Education Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–22|doi=10.1007/s12564-013-9249-x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trune|first=Dennis R|last2=Goslin|first2=Lewis N|date=1998-03-01|title=University Technology Transfer Programs: A Profit/Loss Analysis|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=57|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(97)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischut|first=Peter M.|last2=Haas|first2=Scott|date=2005|title=University Technology Transfer Offices: A Status Report|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=2|issue=2|pages=48–53|issn=1554-169X|pmc=3564362|pmid=23393451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Eisenberg and [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating [[patent thicket]]s and a [[tragedy of the anticommons]] especially in the field of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M.

[[File:Map of Texas highlighting Winkler County.svg|thumb|right|Winkler County, Texas]]
The '''Winkler County nurse whistleblower case''' was a series of legal proceedings in [[West Texas]] that centered on the retaliation upon two nurses who submitted an anonymous state medical board complaint against a physician in 2009. The case attracted national attention for its implications on [[whistleblowing]] by nurses. After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an anonymous complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the [[Texas Medical Board]] (TMB).

When he learned of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of [[Winkler County, Texas|Winkler County]], who was his friend and one of his patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board constituted harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.

The case raised questions about the extent of whistleblower protection for healthcare providers who report patient care concerns to licensing authorities. Texas law included remedies against retaliation for whistleblowers, but no known U.S. state had whistleblower laws that addressed appropriate prosecutorial conduct. According to the Texas Nurses Association, "No one ever imagined that a nurse would be criminally prosecuted for reporting a patient care concern to a licensing agency."&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; After the Mitchell case, protection from prosecution was incorporated into Texas whistleblower laws. The TMB stopped investigating anonymous complaints about physicians in September 2011.

==Background==
The case originated at Winkler County Memorial Hospital (WCMH), a 15-bed hospital in [[Kermit, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Blesch&gt;{{cite web|last=Blesch|first=Gregg|title=Lone Star State showdown: Trial looms for nurses who reported concerns about doctor|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20100201/MAGAZINE/100129957|work=[[Modern Healthcare]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell and Galle were registered nurses at WCMH. The two nurses held multiple roles at the hospital and both were employed there for more than 20 years. Galle was an administrator over [[quality improvement]] and [[utilization management]] for the hospital, while Mitchell served as its [[compliance officer]]. Galle and Mitchell also served as medical staff co-coordinators at WCMH. Mitchell held a part-time role as the county's emergency management coordinator.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; She also had experience as a [[travel nursing|travel nurse]] and as an instructor and director in a [[licensed practical nurse|licensed vocational nursing]] program.&lt;ref name=TTU/&gt;

In April 2008, Arafiles arrived at WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt; He had earned a medical degree in the Philippines before coming to the United States; he continued his training in [[Baltimore]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref name=PPG&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=In Texas, a trial and possible prison time for reporting a doctor|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/us/in-texas-a-trial-and-possible-prison-time-for-reporting-a-doctor-232462/|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013|date=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaney|first=Betsy|title=Former Winkler County hospital administrator Stan Wiley takes plea in retaliation case|url=http://lubbockonline.com/texas/2011-03-22/former-winkler-county-hospital-head-takes-plea-retaliation-case#.UmMfw1CTh50|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise [[nurse practitioner]]s and [[physician assistant]]s for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about the manner in which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and the way that he applied the clinic's patient care protocols.&lt;ref name=Lowes&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowes|first=Robert|title=Physician in whistle-blower case charged by Texas Medical Board|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725195|website=[[Medscape]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell and Galle became concerned about the appropriateness of Arafiles' medical decision making soon after he arrived at WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt; The doctor's practice in Kermit included the use of [[alternative medicine]] therapies such as herbal remedies. Witnesses later said that Mitchell made comments at work which characterized Arafiles as a "witch doctor".&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt; Other coworkers said that Mitchell had legitimate concerns about the quality of the physician's patient care; they said that Mitchell first raised the issues with the hospital's administration, but that her concerns were not addressed. In one incident, Arafiles was alleged to have performed a [[skin grafting|skin graft]] on an emergency room patient even though he was not credentialed to perform surgery at the facility.&lt;ref name=Whistle&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Whistle-blowing nurse is acquitted in Texas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/us/12nurses.html|accessdate=October 19, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patient came to the hospital with a crushed finger and Arafiles allegedly took a rubber tip off of a pair of medical scissors and [[surgical suture|stitched]] it onto the patient's finger.&lt;ref name=OA&gt;{{cite web|last=Mustian|first=Jim|title=Discipline still unclear for Arafiles|url=http://www.oaoa.com/news/article_c4a64052-5874-5956-aaaa-3e1b1223dca5.html?TNNoMobile|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell and Galle sent an anonymous complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter said that the nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed in connection with the complaint.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Case: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509#faq|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328012256/http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509| archivedate=March 28, 2014| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to [[harassment]]. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.&lt;ref name=Veteran&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran Texas sheriff sentenced to jail in nurse retaliation case|url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/123842324.html|publisher=[[KWTX-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts obtained warrants to search the nurses' computers and he found the letter to the TMB. The sheriff was friends with Arafiles. The doctor had treated Roberts in the emergency room for a heart attack. Roberts credited Arafiles with saving his life. He referred to the doctor as "the most sincerely caring person I have ever met."&lt;ref name=Sack&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Nurse to stand trial for reporting doctor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/07nurses.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=March 28, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts later commented on the board report, saying, "If it’s made to destroy somebody’s reputation or forcing them to leave town, then I don’t believe it is good faith."&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt;

==Termination and criminal charges==
Mitchell and Galle were terminated from WCMH in June 2009.&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt; A few days later, both nurses were arrested.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Winkler County nurse saga|url=http://www.oaoa.com/article_e03c4962-8869-5d66-b970-561b8c3efd59.html?mode=jqm|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta rather than as a [[good faith]] reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|patient privacy laws]].&lt;ref name=FWST/&gt;

The case attracted national attention in July 2009 when the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) and Texas Nurses Association (TNA) began to raise awareness of the plight of the nurses. Galle later said, "We didn't have any support - emotional or financial - until TNA and ANA stepped in."&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice is Served: Texas Physician Pleads Guilty|url=http://nursingworld.org/FunctionalMenuCategories/MediaResources/PressReleases/2011-PR/Justice-is-Served-Texas-Physician-Pleads-Guilty.pdf|publisher=[[American Nurses Association]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TNA filed a complaint with the [[Texas Department of State Health Services]] (DSHS) that resulted in an onsite investigation of the hospital.&lt;ref name=TNA&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Hospital Faces $15,850 Fine|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=538|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2010, the TNA Legal Defense Fund had collected more than $45,000 in donations to the defense of Galle and Mitchell.&lt;ref name=Acquits&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Guilty - Texas Jury Acquits Winkler County Nurse|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMB executive director Mari Robinson commented that such prosecution could have "a significant chilling effect" on the reporting of physician practice issues.&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt;

The charges against Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county attorney Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts and the personal attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby [[Andrews County, Texas|Andrews County]] discouraged Tidwell from trying the case.&lt;ref name=Inglis/&gt; At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, but he said that his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and that he did not have a business relationship with Arafiles.&lt;ref name=FWST&gt;{{cite web|last=Berard|first=Yamil and Darren Barbee|title=Whistle-blower nurse is acquitted in West Texas|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/02/11/v-print/1963997/whistle-blower-nurse-is-acquitted.html|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys with the office of the [[Texas Attorney General]] took on Mitchell's case after being contacted by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint with the office. "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves at the expense of the office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case."&lt;ref name=Inglis2&gt;{{cite web|last=Inglis|first=Toni|title=Whistle-blower nurses see justice in the end|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/inglis-whistle-blower-nurses-see-justice-in-the-en/nRqPw/|work=Austin American-Statesman|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her.&lt;ref name=FWST/&gt; In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he wondered why the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety."&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt;

==Aftermath==
TNA asserted that state laws, including the Texas Nursing Practice Act and the Public Employee Whistleblower Law, gave any health care provider the right to report concerns about the patient care of other providers. Under these protections, a termination could be presumed improper if it occurred within 60 days of filing such a complaint. Mitchell and Galle filed a civil lawsuit against Winkler County, WCMH, Wiley, Roberts, Tidwell and Arafiles. The lawsuit alleged violations of civil rights, breaches of due process and improper termination.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; 

A few months after Mitchell's trial, Galle and Mitchell split a $750,000 settlement in the civil suit.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The nurses, who both live in [[Jal, New Mexico]], were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Texas Nurses Fired for Alleging Misconduct Settle Their Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/us/11whistle.html|accessdate=October 19, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, "He’s done a lot of good in this county. If you have a heart attack or anything of that nature in the emergency room, he is definitely the doctor that you want to take care of you."&lt;ref name=Settle&gt;{{cite web|last=Mustian|first=Jim|title=Nurses settle civil suit|url=http://www.oaoa.com/news/article_cb44d4f4-a58a-572d-bd32-627bc95fef78.html|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several officials faced criminal charges for their involvement in the prosecution or termination of Galle and Mitchell. Wiley was the first to go to trial after he was indicted on two felony counts of [[retaliation]]. He pleaded guilty to the lesser of the two charges. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $2,000 fine and agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of other involved officials.&lt;ref name=Inglis/&gt; Wiley terminated Galle and Mitchell after they submitted the anonymous medical board complaint.&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt; He submitted his resignation from the hospital in August 2010, but the WCMH board of directors declined to accept it. He resigned again in October 2010.&lt;ref name=OA2&gt;{{cite web|last=Mustian|first=Jim|title=Wiley resigns - again|url=http://www.oaoa.com/news/article_ebbaa853-2d68-51f6-bcf5-a171c048d07a.html?TNNoMobile|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roberts was convicted on two counts of misuse of official information, two counts of retaliation and two counts of official oppression. In June 2011, he was sentenced to 100 days in jail, four years of felony probation and a $6,000 fine. After the sentence, Roberts was removed as sheriff and forced to surrender his license as a peace officer.&lt;ref name=Sheriff&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Sheriff Found Guilty on All Counts, Sentence Handed Down|url=http://www.newswest9.com/story/14905816/winkler-county-sheriff-found-guilty-on-all-counts|publisher=[[KWES-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convicted on similar charges, Tidwell was removed from office and sentenced to 120 days in jail, ten years of probation and a $6,000 fine.&lt;ref name=Tidwell&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Tidwell Sentenced for Retaliating Against Kermit Nurses|url=http://www.newswest9.com/story/15615919/scott-tidwell-sentenced-for-retaliating-against-kermit-nurses|publisher=[[KWES-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidwell's trial publicly uncovered a 2004 guilty plea he entered after being charged with soliciting a prostitute.&lt;ref name=Inglis&gt;{{cite web|last=Inglis|first=Toni|title=Final of four Winkler County 'good ol' boys' faces charges in court|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/inglis-final-of-four-winkler-county-good-ol-boys-1/nRgHR/|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSHS assessed a $15,850 fine against the hospital for inadequate supervision of Arafiles and illegal termination of Galle and Mitchell.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt;

By mid-2011, Arafiles had moved his practice to [[East Texas]] and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in [[Grand Saline, Texas|Grand Saline]]. A hospital administrator there said that she had looked into some of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Beau|title=Dr. Rolando Arafiles Working at East Texas Hospital 6/9/11|url=http://www.cbs7kosa.com/news/details.asp?ID=26316|publisher=CBS 7 News|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref name=Sentenced&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas: Doctor who retaliated against whistle-blowers is sentenced|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/texas-doctor-who-retaliated-against-whistle-blowers-is-sentenced.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 29, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the people involved in the nurses' case had assumed new employment by the summer of 2012. Mitchell found a position in New Mexico working with the developmentally disabled. Galle, who said in 2010 that the case had "derailed our careers",&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt; entered early retirement.&lt;ref name=Inglis2/&gt; Galle and Mitchell earned the Dean's Advocacy Award from the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=TTU&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Nursing Distinguished Alumni 2010|url=http://www.ttuhsc.edu/communications/pulse/winter10/DistinguishedAlumni.aspx|publisher=[[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arafiles passed away in [http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rolando-Arafiles++M.D.&amp;lc=4619&amp;pid=169484217&amp;mid=5840571# January of 2014]. Wiley left Winkler County for Lubbock. Tidwell appealed the revocation of his license to practice law&lt;ref name=Inglis2/&gt; but in 2014 he resigned from the bar rather than face further disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Bar of Texas|url=https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Find_A_Lawyer&amp;template=/Customsource/MemberDirectory/MemberDirectoryDetail.cfm&amp;ContactID=189607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New legislation stopped the TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians as of the fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.&lt;ref name=Roser&gt;{{cite web|last=Roser|first=Mary Ann|title=New law bans anonymous complaints about doctors|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/new-law-bans-anonymous-complaints-about-doctors/nRfcR/|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
