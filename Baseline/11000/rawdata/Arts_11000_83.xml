[[File:First Battle Squadron of Dreadnoughts.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"The First Battle Squadron of Dreadnoughts" (1910)]]
'''Alma Claude Burlton Cull''' (1880-1931) was a noted English marine painter who worked in watercolours and oils. He specialised in painting [[Royal Navy]] ships.

Cull exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours]], the Walker Art Gallery and the London Salon. In his retirement he lived at [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] in Hampshire; his widow continuing to live there after 1931. For safekeeping she stored his unsold works in his studio in [[Old Portsmouth]], where they were destroyed by enemy bombs in 1940 during the [[Second World War]]. Some of his work is exhibited at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tryon.co.uk/alma-burlton-cull&lt;/ref&gt;

Cull was a contemporary of the prolific [[William Lionel Wyllie]] RA. Cull's paintings are much rarer than those by Wyllie and are regarded as being on a par with Wyllie's. [[Edward VII]] commissioned some of his paintings. Cull paintings are sought after and only occasionally appear at auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artistsharbour.com/artists/index.php?id=21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/documents/SB45_Autumn2012.pdf |title=''Scuttlebutt'', magazine of the Royal Naval Museum |access-date=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322083650/http://royalnavalmuseum.org/documents/SB45_Autumn2012.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group included originally 10 artists: [[Jüri Arrak]], {{ILL|Kristiina Kaasik|et}}, [[Tõnis Laanemaa]], [[Malle Leis]], [[Marju Mutsu]], {{ILL|Enno Ootsing|et}}, [[Tiiu Pallo-resin]], {{ILL|Vello Tamm|et}}, {{ILL|Aili Vint|et}} and [[Tõnis Vint]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-the-baltics-the-struggle-for-freedom-of-artistic-expression-under-the-soviets-1945-1991/oclc/46918250/viewport ANK group] discussed by Eda Sepp in ''Estonian Non-conformist art from the Soviet occupation in 1944 to Perestroika'', p. 67 in chapter 2 in ''Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991'', edited by Jane Voorhees, Alla Rosenfeld and Norton T. Dodge, exhibition catalog Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 2001/2002, {{ISBN|978-0813530420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not practice any specific style of art, but recognized as works of art anything related to modern youth culture such as [[pop-art]]. Members of the group were not only active as artists, but also organized and attended lectures on foreign artists and their activities. Members of the group were involved in the Leningrad and Moscow underground [[Soviet Nonconformist Art|non-conformist art]] movement.

The first group exhibition was held in 1964 on the premises of the Estonian Theatre. A retrospective of their work 50 years after they first gathered was held in the [[Tallinn Art Hall]] from 6 November-15 December 2013. Many of the original artists were still active at the time and showed their recent work in addition to a historical overview.

The '''[[Adysh]] [[Gospels]]''' (Adishi [[Four Gospels]]) ({{lang-ka|ადიშის ოთხთავი}}) is an important early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gospel Book]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 

[[Image:Canon - Adysh Gospels.jpg|left|thumb|100px|A Georgian reproduction of the Canon table by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].]] 

The oldest dated extant [[manuscript]] of the Georgian version of the [[Gospels]], it was created by [[Mikaeli]] at [[Shatberdi Monastery]] in the southwestern Georgian princedom of [[Klarjeti]] (located now in northeastern [[Turkey]]) in AD 897, and later removed thence to be preserved in the remote village of [[Adysh]] (Adishi) in highland [[Svaneti]]. The first five folios (30 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm) of the [[Illumination (manuscript)|manuscript are illuminated]].

The manuscript was first published, in 1916, by the prominent Georgian scholar [[Ekvtime Takaishvili]]. It has been extensively studied by both Georgian and international scholars (e.g., [[Robert Pierpont Blake]] of [[Harvard University]]). The manuscript is now preserved in the [[Mestia]] Ethnographic Museum, Georgia.

== Text ==

It lacks text of [[Christ's agony at Gethsemane]] (Luke 22:43–44), and [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|pericope of the adulteress]] (John 7:53-8:11), [[Mark 16|Longer Ending of Mark]] (Mark 16:9–20), the tradition of an angel who stirred the waters at the Pool of Bethesda (John 5:4), necessity for praying to Jesus(John 14:14), parable of two men in the field (Luke 17:36), Jesus' remark about his listeners (Mark 7:16), Jesus' speech about cutting sinful feet (Mark 9:44, 46), and Jesus' advice to forgive sins to others (Mark 11:26), Jesus' remark about people who do not go without prayer or fasting (Matthew 17:21), and one of Jesus' condemnatory sentences towards Scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 23:14); Thus providing the only (but earliest) Georgian witness for the omission of these passages.

The gospel also has some interesting variants. For example in both Matthew 19:24 and Mark 10:25 the text reads "rope" instead of traditional "camel".

The reuse of [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s (also known as Software Assets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a strategy that many, in particular [[Information technology|IT]], companies are pursuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Reusable-Asset-Initiative-is-IBMs-Secret-Weapon-for-Industry-Solutions-853170/|publisher=eWeek.com|title= Reusable Asset Initiative Is IBM's Secret Weapon for Industry Solutions|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-assetreuse/|publisher=ibm.com|title= RWeb services and asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy for reusing non-IT related assets is called [[Asset recovery]]. However, the term recovery is not being applied to [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html|publisher=www.anthillpro.com|title= How Does AnthillPro Help Me Reuse My Software Assets?|accessdate=2010-04-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310173944/http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html| archivedate= 10 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISPW.1996.654354|publisher=computer.org|title= An open architecture for software process asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These IP assets (or software assets) can be defined as (see Forrester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
Internally developed or acquired software artifacts that IT services vendors use to automate a particular business process or aspect of product development for a range of clients. Software assets provide 30% to 90% of the solution that the client is looking for and are reused across multiple engagements.

==Benefits for the client==
Amongst other benefits, the key advantages of reusing assets are:
# Increase delivery efficiency
# Innovate from a higher level
# Use best practices
# Reduce risk
# Offer wider array of flexible solutions.

==Requirements==
In order to implement Asset Reuse within a major company, it takes at least:
* a system where to store and retrieve relevant assets
* a management system to handle the asset management
* a communication set-up to promote the reuse of piled up assets.

==Implications==
Till now a number of companies have tried to implement asset reuse. However, common implications are:
* the use of more than one asset repository
* the operation model: set-up, funding, and maintenance of the required asset management system including success tracking over a long time
* permanent cross-company communication of the asset management system strategy and its latest elements

==History of the theatre==
The theatre has its origins in [[Culture of Azerbaijan|national holidays]] and dances. Elements of theatricality were contained in many kinds of national creativity accompanying national festivities, traditional holidays and other occasions. On 10 March 1873, under the guidance of [[Hasan bey Zardabi]] and with the participation of students of the Real School of Baku, a performance was held – [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov|M.F.Akhundov]]’s "Vizier of [[Talysh Khanate|Lankaran khanate]]" comedy was showas heldwn. The professional Azerbaijani theatre was originated after this very performance. In 1919, separated troupes joined up and the theatre acquired the state recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1991, the theatre was renamed to the  "Azerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre".

In Korean art history, the '''Baekje smile''' is the common smile motif found in [[Baekje]] sculpture and bas-relief.  Baekje figures express a unique smile that has been described as both enigmatic and subtle.  The smile has been also been characterized in many different ways from "genuinely glowing" to "thin and mild" to "unfathomable and benevolent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121125905/http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |archive-date=2006-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynamic-korea.com/culture/view.php?main=LEC&amp;uid=200500022289]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/scu/paekche_period.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]], Baekje art was stylistically the most realistic and technically sophisticated {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  While [[Goguryeo]] sculpture was highly rigid and [[Silla]] sculpture was formalized, Baekje sculpture exhibited distinct characteristics of warmth, softness, and used relaxed poses.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  Sometimes, the Baekje style has been attributed to influence from the southern Chinese dynasties.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  However, the most remarkable feature of Baekje sculpture is the distinctive Baekje smile.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].   The smile gives the Baekje statues a sense of friendliness and an air of pleasantness that is rarely found in other traditions of [[Buddhist]] sculpture. The smile is considered to be unique and distinctive.  [http://www.buddhamuseum.com/korean-buddha.html].

'''''Betrayed''''' is a 1988 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], written by [[Joe Eszterhas]], and starring [[Debra Winger]] and [[Tom Berenger]]. The plot is roughly based upon the terrorist activities of American [[neo-Nazi]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Robert Jay Mathews|Robert Mathews]] and his group [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].

==Plot==
Set in the American Midwest, the film begins with the murder of a Jewish radio host in [[Chicago]]. [[FBI]] [[undercover]] agent Catherine Weaver, alias Katie Phillips, sets out to [[wiktionary:Infiltrate|infiltrate]] a farming community, suspected of harboring those responsible.

After receiving a warm welcome from land-owner and farmer Gary Simmons, his two children and [[extended family]], she begins to believe that the FBI lead is erroneous. Throwing caution to the wind, she falls in love with Simmons, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who appears to command the respect of the local community. A short while later, her suspicions are aroused by talk of family secrets and as more chilling events unfold, Katie is exposed to the fact that Gary is the leader of a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan-like]] [[white supremacy]] group involved in heinous, often gut-wrenching, acts of racial violence.

In too deep, Katie pleads with boss and mentor Michael Carnes to release her from the assignment, but he refuses, instead turning the screw on her mixed loyalties. Ultimately, she must betray either the man she loves or the country she has sworn to protect.

==Cast==
* [[Debra Winger]] as Catherine "Cathy" Weaver / Katie Philips
* [[Tom Berenger]] as Gary Simmons
* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Michael "Mike" Carnes
* [[Betsy Blair]] as Gladys Simmons
* [[John Mahoney]] as Shorty
* [[Ted Levine]] as Wes
* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Bobby Flynn
* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as Al Sanders

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Betrayed'' was met with mixed reviews, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 42% "Rotten" rating based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002205-betrayed/ RottenTomatoes.com rating information]&lt;/ref&gt; Winger's performance was praised by some reviewers, who felt she was successful in conveying complex and mixed emotions throughout. Critics of the film point to a muddled and sometimes unbelievable unravelling of the plot.

The opening sequence is loosely based on the 1984 murder of Denver DJ [[Alan Berg]], which was carried out by white supremacists known as [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].

In a 1996 interview, Berenger named ''Betrayed'' as his favorite film, shrugging off any media criticism with the retort "It was exactly what it was meant to be".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html Tom Berenger Biography at www.tv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928121632/http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html |date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Birthday Stories'''''|バースデイ・ストーリーズ|Bāsudei sutōrīzu {{=}} Birthday stories}} is a 2002 [[short story]] [[anthology]] edited by [[Japanese author]] [[Haruki Murakami]]. Despite the theme's happy connotations most of the short stories have a dark, melancholic atmosphere.

==Editions==
Murakami selected and translated the texts, adding an original short story of his (later collected into his own ''[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]'', 2006). For the English edition at Harvill Press (using the original English-language versions of the stories), he added an introduction and selected one more story. For the Japanese reprint, he added two stories. The main editions are thus:

* 2002: Japanese-language, 11 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|51550239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: English-language, 12 stories plus introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|56458981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2006: Japanese-language, 13 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|63208189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The 2004 English edition of the anthology starts with an introduction by Haruki Murakami, where he speaks about his birthday and of [[birthday]]s in general (for example he mentions his visit [[Jack London]]'s farm, which he did because he liked London's writings and because they share the same birthday).

It compiles:
* ("Introduction : My birthday, your birthday", by Haruki Murakami — added to English ed. only)
* "[[Forever Overhead]]" (by [[David Foster Wallace]])
* "[[Turning (short story)|Turning]]" (by [[Lynda Sexson]])

One of the indicators of the strength of a [[brand]] in the hearts and minds of customers, '''brand preference''' represents which brands are preferred under assumptions of equality in price and availability.

== Purpose ==

Measures of brand preference attempt to quantify the impact of [[marketing]] activities in the hearts and minds of customers and potential customers. Higher brand preference usually indicates more revenues (sales) and profit, also making it an indicator of company financial performance.

== Construction ==
There are at least three classes of methodologies to measure brand preference directly: 
* [[Statistical survey|Survey]] questions (self-report, unaided preference)
* Brand choice measures (choice of preferred brand from a competitive set of brands)
* Constant sum measures (planned purchases amongst a competitive set of brands)

==Background==
[[File:Casa Santa Museum.jpeg|thumbnail|Casa Santa Museum]]
One of the most famous attractions east of [[Metro Manila]], located in the hills of [[Antipolo]], just 30 minutes away from Ortigas is the CASA SANTA @ Jardin de Miramar.

The Casa Santa houses an internationally recognized collection of [[Santa Claus]] items ranging from life size, singing santas to Turkish inspired bronze plaques of Santa Claus. At present, it is probably the most extensive private collection of Santa Claus items in the world with over  3,700++ santas. And unlike traditional [[museum]]s, the Casa Santa is a fun museum in that the visitors are free to inspect the items closely, or in some cases, play with it.

Casa Santa started out as a small personal collection and it grew in size until it needed a house where the Santas could "live." The Casa Santa was converted from a family resthouse into a museum of Santa Claus collection in 1995.  The house was remodeled by folk architect Rosario Encarnacion Tan and the [[Lighting designer|lighting design]] inside the museum was crafted by international Japanese light designer Shoko Matsumoto.

In December 2004, it was the cover of ''Starweek'''s Christmas and in Christmas 2008 appeared in the front page of the ''[[Philippine Inquirer]]''. It has appeared in over 50 T.V. and movie productions -- ''[[Rated K]]'', ''[[Wish Ko Lang]]'','' [[Unang Hirit]]'', ''Magandang Umagang Bayan'', ''US Girls'', ''[[Boy and Kris]]''.  On international television, it was covered by two  news agencies, [[Reuters]] and [[Associated Press]].

Addition to the collection is a room full of miniature [[Christmas village]]s.  A starter collection in the loft was displayed in 2010. After acquiring a significant number of mini- houses this year, it was given a room of its own.  The village was designed by Bamboo Tonogbanua of [[Bacolod]], himself a Christmas village collector.

NEWEST ATTRACTION

This 2015 a newly renovated Santa's village has been created by Christmas village miniature artist Bamboo Tonogbanua, a Cebuano Artist.

CASA SANTA PLAYROOM, a room designed to house small &amp; big santa stuffed toys collection. A colorful room designed, full of toys and entertaining surprises.

And by December, Jardin de Miramar has its newest &amp; modern facility, the Isla Palma Resort located within the compound.  It is nature-inspired and imprints a platform strategically made for thematic events, weddings, corporate parties,  cocktails, team building activities or simply for private celebrations.  Its setting creates a distinct feel of being in an island with a pavilion seating 300 persons and a 250 sq m wrap-around pool. Discover the tropical allure of the Isla Palma Resort – a quiet haven with an urban feel set in the midst of a countryside locale.

Another curious item in the Jardin de Miramar is the restored [[Noah's Ark]] found in the Galera and surrounded by a rustic playground. Noah's Ark is newly renovated multi-colored fishing boat artistically reconstructed into a play area.  And like any work of art in Jardin, this old boat not only serves as a charming relic that is lovely to look at.  It is a hardworking piece of art where children can play "sailor and pirate, hike and seek, go up and down the lighthouse and pyramid tree, run along the bridges and do the monkey swings. .

Jardin has extended its collection to other works of art such as the sculptures/creation of nationally recognized artists Ed Castrillo, Michael Cacnio, Daniel dela Cruz, Tony Leano, Ral Arrogante, mural works by Alfred Galvez; mosaic works by Hannah Liongoren. The three-hectare Jardin de Miramar is also the most popular party venue in the East and is the only wedding and party place  with each of the 9 venues having a thematic look and character.   It is also popular as a prenuptial photo shoot venue.

'''Center Stage''' is the state theater of [[Maryland]], and [[Baltimore]]'s largest professional producing theater. Center Stage began in a converted gymnasium in 1963 as a full arena theatre that seated 240 people.

Center Stage houses two performing spaces, the 541-seat Pearlstone and the smaller Head Theater, both in its home in the Mount Vernon Cultural District of Baltimore.

==History==
Launched in 1963 by a group of local theater supporters, Center Stage soon became a leader in America's regional theater movement, with the goal of producing first-rate professional theater for local audiences, along with theaters like [[The Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis, [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, and [[Alley Theatre]] in Houston. On January 10th 1974, an arson fire (which was noted to be set off by two men who were forcibly removed from the next door bar Benny Goodmans Beef And Beer was out to burn down the bar for revenge, but accidentally mistook the Center Stage Theatre for the bar by setting it ablaze in the back part of the building), burned its North Avenue home to the ground. In 1931 the North Avenue building was previously occupied by a theatre called The Peabody which opened in the early 1900s, in 1931 Orioles Cafeteria a local food chain restaurant moved into the space at 11 East North Avenue and moved out in August 1965 to make space for The Center Stage Theatre, after the building burned down in .74 many decided that since the outer shell was not severely damaged that some hope have been considered for savage use, but the interior was completely destroyed and unstable and was later on considered unsafe by city inspectors and construction crews and was later demolished, although the majority of the building was demolished both sides of the facades columns remain to remind passerby's what was once there, today the site of the North Avenue building is currently a small parking lot for used cars and auto repairing. Additional stage hands quickly rebuilt the set for Noel Coward's ''Hayfever'' and help from local civic leaders, the theater continued its season at a local college (once a part of Loyola High School and College), and used the disaster to launch a major public relations and capital campaign to keep the organization alive. The theater ultimately moved into a new space carved out of an abandoned Jesuit college. Since that time, it has become Baltimore's leading professional theater, hosting more than 100,000 people each season to its home in [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]].

In 2011, British playwright [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]] succeeded Irene Lewis as artistic director of Center Stage. Center Stage audiences became familiar with him in 2005 when Kwei-Armah’s most recognized work ''Elmina’s Kitchen'' held its American premiere at Center Stage. The play had previously debuted at the National Theatre in London in 2003, making Kwei-Armah the first Black Briton to have a play produced on the West End. Under the direction of Kwei-Armah, Center Stage has transitioned from a six play to a seven play season that includes a mix of comedy, drama, and musicals. 

Main stage performances occur in either the 541-seat Pearlstone Theater or the smaller, flexible-layout Head Theater. The Play Lab series features new work from emerging and established artists. Third Spaces brings theater to unexpected stages, such as the 2013 production of The Container, which placed a small audience inside a shipping container, and Fourth Spaces explores the relationship between technology and artistry, using the Center Stage interactive media wall to connect audiences and theater artists.

The '''arms of the [[University of Cambridge]]''' in [[Cambridge]], England, are [[blazon|blazoned]]: ''[[Gules]], on a [[cross (heraldry)|cross]] [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] between four [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] passant guardant [[or (heraldry)|Or]], a [[Bible]] lying fesseways of the field, clasped and garnished of the third, the clasps in base.''
Or in layman's terms: 

{{cquote|On a red background, a cross of ermine fur between four gold lions walking but with one fore-leg raised, and facing the observer. These lions must always face the left-hand edge of the page or item on which the arms are displayed (which means they are facing right, heraldically speaking). On the centre of the cross is a closed book with its spine horizontal and with clasps and decoration, the clasps pointing downward.|author=University of Cambridge Communications Team}}

The arms were granted at the 1573 [[heraldic visitation|visitation]] of the [[County of Cambridge]] undertaken by [[Robert Cooke (officer of arms)|Robert Cooke]], the then [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], and a graduate of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. The lions represent the university's royal patronage, the ermine represents dignity, and the Bible on the cross represents both knowledge and the Christian faith.

The motto is not a fixed or necessary component of the arms, but the motto generally used by the University is ''Hinc lucem et pocula sacra'', Latin for "From here, light and sacred draughts". This derives from an emblem traditionally used by the [[Cambridge University Press|University Press]], featuring the ''alma mater'' ("nourishing mother") of Cambridge with a sun in one hand, representing enlightenment, and in the other a cup collecting droplets from the sky, representing spiritual sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bedders, Bulldogs and Bedells: a Cambridge Glossary|publisher=the University Press|location=Cambridge|last=Stubbings|first=Frank|date=1995|page=39|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2udnDNt_iIoC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It spans {{convert|14|m}} by {{convert|123|m}} and depicts a circular [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] of the [[Battle of Frankenhausen]], fought on 15 May 1525 during the [[German Peasants' War]]. The painting has more than 3000 characters.&lt;ref name="kunstarchiv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gesichter-des-dka.gnm.de/content/mdc_person733a|title=Tübke, Werner|language=German|work=Die Gesichter des Deutschen Kunstarchivs|publisher=[[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]|accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8810">'''Fairy cup legends''' (Reidar Thoralf Christiansen type ML 6045) are folk and other tales usually relating to the theft of a 'fairy cup', sometimes in the form of a drinking horn, usually from a 'fairy mound' (ie from a ''[[tumulus]]''). They are found in parts of northwestern Europe.

==Overview==
''Fairy Cup Legends'' are classified under [[Reidar Thoralf Christiansen]]'s scheme as migratory type 6045.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A migratory type is one that occurs in several places&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of this type originate from England, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Isle of Man, and Scotland.{{sfn|Ashliman|2009}}

In many versions of the tale the vessel is in the shape of the horn;&lt;ref group ="n"&gt;The Oldenburg Horn; The Öiestad Horn; The Fairy Horn&lt;/ref&gt; usually the vessel is gold(en), or of some other precious material. Tales often begin with a hole in the ground or similar opening up mysteriously, revealing 'little people' living underground.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The Stolen Cup; Church Cup (Ragebøl); The Trolls Celebrate Christmas; The Fairy Banquet; The Silver Cup&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions the fairy person offers a drink from the cup, which the protagonist refuses or discards - with the vessel's discarded liquid often acting  corrosively&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The Oldenburg Horn; Church Cup (Viöl); Church Cup (Ragebøl); The Altar Cup in Aagerup; Svend Fælling and the Elle-Maid; The Öiestad Horn; The Fairy Banquet; The Fairy Cup of Kirk Malew; The Silver Cup&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the vessel is stolen by the human protagonist of the tale, them then being consumed by fear and often chased by angry supernatural beings&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The Oldenburg Horn; The Stolen Cup; Church Cup (Viöl); Church Cup (Ragebøl); The Altar Cup in Aagerup; The Öiestad Horn; The Trolls Celebrate Christmas; The Fairy Banquet; The Silver Cup&lt;/ref&gt; - the vessel is sometimes recorded as ending in the possession of nobility,&lt;ref group ="n"&gt;The Oldenburg Horn; The Trolls Celebrate Christmas; The Fairy Banquet; The Fairy Horn&lt;/ref&gt; or the church.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Church Cup (Viöl); Church Cup (Ragebøl); Church Cup (Hjordkær); The Altar Cup in Aagerup; Origin of the Noble Name of Trolle; The Fairy Cup of Kirk Malew; The Silver Cup&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar tales also existed for [[Dunvegan Castle]] (see [[Dunvegan Cup]]), and at [[Raasay]]. Other folktales exist involving Luran.

==Archaeology==

Numerous types of vessel (usually pottery) are found associated with British tumulus burials, including items that were either cremation containers, or assumed to be containers for food offerings for the afterlife, or simply treasures or personal effects.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|loc=Introduction, pp.35-60}} Of these some have been indentified as 'drinking cups', usual associated with non-cremated internments.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|pp=61-62}} Roughly similar cups have been found in Northern Germany, Denmark, and Holland.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|pp=62-63}} 

The form of these cups differs from those found in Roman or Anglo-Saxon burials in Britain. The pottery is hand made, not from made on a wheel, and is usually well decorated.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|p=63}} The usual form in Britain is a well decorated 'beaker' shape, though cups with handles are also known from the [[Yorkshire Wolds]], and elsewhere.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|pp=93-6}} {{harv|Greenwell|1877}} considered that the generally detailed decoration made them impracticable for general daily use, and that they were made specifically for burial with the dead.{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|pp=105-9}}

Non pottery cups include one made of [[shale]], found near [[Honiton]].{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|p=97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title  =Sepulchral Barrows at Broad Down, Near Honiton, and an Unique Cup of Bituminous Shale there Found | first =  Richard | last = Kirwan  | pages = 290-311 | doi =  10.1080/00665983.1868.10851422 | journal = Archaeological Journal | volume = 25 | year = 1868 | issue =1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an amber cup from near [[Hove]] (the [[Hove amber cup]]),{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|p=97}} and the [[Rillaton gold cup]].{{sfn|Greenwell|1877|pp=97-8}}

==Other 'Fairy Cup' variants==

{{harv|Ashliman|2009}} also gives the story of ''The Rillaton Gold Cup'' as being of this type, though the tale is different being of an inexhaustable cup offered by a druid. This tale is associated with [[Rillaton Barrow]]. ''The Trowie "Pig"'', from Scotland, also tells of an inexhautable jug.

There is a Scottish folktale from the 17th century of a man who sees a whirlwind in a field and hears voices saying ''"Horse and Hattock"'' - he repeats the phrase and is swept up by the wind and wakes up the next day in the King of France's cellar with a silver cup in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Scottish Fairy Belief: A History | first = Lizanne| last = Henderson| first2= Edward J. | last2 = Cowan | page=38 | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fairy origin legend has also been given to the glass known as the [[Luck of Edenhall]], a 14th C. drinking glass originating in the middle east. In the legend, which may have been invented in the 18th C., the cup was obtained when fairies were interrupted drinking at a well at Eden Hall ([[Edenhall]]), and left the glass behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-luck-of-edenhall | title = The Luck of Edenhall | work = www.vam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fan vault''' is a form of [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] used in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], in which the ribs are all of the same curve and spaced equidistantly, in a manner resembling a [[fan (implement)|fan]].  The initiation and propagation of this design element is strongly associated with [[England]].

The earliest example, dating from about the year 1351,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannia.com/church/studies/glosarch.html Britannia: Architecture of Gloucester Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen in the cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=1.C.2.2.1.4 Pevsner Architectural Guides fan vault design]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest fan vault in the world can be found in [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]].

The fan vault is peculiar to England. The [[Lierne (vault)|lierne]] vault of the cathedral of [[Barbastro]] in northern Spain closely resembles a fan vault, but it does not form a perfect [[conoid]]. [[John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) suggests [[Catherine of Aragon]] as a possible source of English influence in [[Aragon]].&lt;ref name="harvey"/&gt;

==Birth of the fan vault==
The fan vault is attributed to development in [[Gloucester]] between 1351 and 1377,&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;
{{Cite book
  | last = Harvey | first = John
  | title = The Perpendicular Style

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest known surviving example being the east cloister walk of [[Gloucester Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Verey]], ''[[Gloucestershire]]'', [[Yale University]] Press, New Haven, Connecticut, USA (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) hypothesises that the east cloister at Gloucester was finished under Thomas de Cantebrugge from the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Cambridge, Gloucestershire]], who left in 1364 to work on the [[chapter house]] at [[Hereford Cathedral]] (also thought to have been fan vaulted on the basis of a drawing by [[William Stukeley]]).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The other three parts of the cloister at Gloucester were begun in 1381, possibly under Robert Lesyngham.

Other examples of early fan vaults exist around [[Gloucester]], implying the activity of several 14th century master masons in this region, who really created the fan vault and experimented with forms of its early use.

== Structure ==
The ribs of a fan vault are of equal curvature and rotated at equal distances around a central (vertical) axis, forming the conoid shape which gives rise to the name. In between sequences of conoids, flat central [[spandrel]]s fill the space. According to Leedy (1980), the fan vault was developed in England (as opposed to France and other centres of gothic architecture) due to the manner in which English [[rib vault]]s were normally constructed.&lt;ref name="leedy"/&gt; In an English rib vault, the courses are laid perpendicular to the ''rib'' while in France they are laid perpendicular to the wall.

'''''Free to Be… You and Me''''' was a children's entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author [[Marlo Thomas]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]],&lt;ref name=NPR-MorningEdition-40th-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rachel|title=40 Years On, 'Free To Be' Still Resonates|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166735512/40-years-on-free-to-be-message-still-resonates|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]]|date=7 December 2012|format=Audio interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a [[record album]] and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as "[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends") including [[Alan Alda]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Jack Cassidy]], and [[Diana Ross]]. An ABC special, also created by [[Marlo Thomas]], using poetry, songs, and sketches followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s [[gender neutrality]], saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

== Overview ==
The original idea to create the album began with [[Marlo Thomas]],&lt;ref name=Makers-Birth-FTBYAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Marlo|title=Birth of 'Free to Be... You and Me'|url=http://www.makers.com/marlo-thomas/moments/birth-free-be%E2%80%A6-you-and-me|website=[[Makers: Women Who Make America|Makers]]|accessdate=19 October 2014|format=Video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children's books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told my sister Terre "it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it (stories featuring traditional gender roles) the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read" and she said "You go and find 'em." 

Well there weren't any. And not only weren't there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book - I'm Glad I'm a Boy! I'm Glad I'm a Girl! by [[Whitney Darrow, Jr.]]) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said "Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses." Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. 

So I said "I'll make a record for Dionne. I'll ask everybody to donate their talents and it'll be fun." [[Larry Uttal]] at [[Bell Records]] told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It's still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Produced by [[Carole Hart]], with music produced by [[Stephen J. Lawrence]] and [[Bruce Hart (songwriter)|Bruce Hart]], with stories and poems directed by [[Alan Alda]], the title has never been out of print.

Proceeds went to the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]]. The album was originally released on [[Bell Records]] in 1972 and since 1975 has been available on [[Arista Records]] cassettes and CDs. 

Well-known songs include "It's All Right to Cry," sung by football hero [[Rosey Grier]]; the title track by [[the New Seekers]]; "Helping," a Shel Silverstein poem performed by [[Tom Smothers]]; "Sisters and Brothers" by the [[Voices of East Harlem]]; and "When We Grow Up" performed by [[Diana Ross]] on the album and by [[Roberta Flack]] and a teenage [[Michael Jackson]] on the special.

Other sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include "Atalanta," co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] of [[Atalanta]]; "Boy Meets Girl" with Thomas and [[Mel Brooks]] providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by [[Wayland Flowers]], resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; "[[William's Doll]]", based on [[Charlotte Zolotow]]'s picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and "Dudley Pippin" with [[Robert Morse]] and [[Billy De Wolfe]], based on stories by Phil Ressner.

A number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although ''Housework'' was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its' description of domestic workers.

Marlo Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In among all the praise we got for the project as a whole, we kept getting all these letters and phone calls talking about the track sounding as if it wasn't normal to be fond of cooking and cleaning and caretaking etc. So we left that off the special for that reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], then editor of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' Most of the children attended Corlears School.

"[[Marlo Thomas]] and Friends" followed ''Free to Be... You and Me'' with a 1988 sequel, ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]'', the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.

In her 2010 memoir, ''Growing Up Laughing'', [[Marlo Thomas]] reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Television special ==
The television special, produced by [[Marlo Thomas]] and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-[[Fred Wolf Films]], Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  It earned an 18.6 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]/27 share and went on to win an [[Emmy]]. Sixteen-mm prints of the special were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, in their school during that period.

The special appeared occasionally on [[HBO]] in the 1980s. It was released on VHS through [[Vestron Video]] subsidiary [[Children's Video Library]] in 1983.  It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land, yet has not been aired on any network since.

A [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] DVD of the television special was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.

'''Hillwood Estate, Museum &amp; Gardens''' is a [[decorative arts]] museum in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. The former residence of businesswoman, socialite, philanthropist and collector [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]], Hillwood is known for its large decorative arts collection that focuses heavily on the [[House of Romanov]], including [[Fabergé egg]]s. Other highlights are 18th and 19th century [[French art]] and one of the country's finest [[orchid]] collections.

==History==
As she arranged her divorce from her third husband, [[Joseph E. Davies]], Post initiated a search for a new house. She wanted a stately home with fifteen-foot ceilings, sited on a large, thickly wooded spot.  After the divorce was final, she bought ''Arbremont'', a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Colonial Georgian#Colonial Georgian architecture|Colonial]] estate in northwest Washington on the edge of [[Rock Creek Park]], rechristening it ''Hillwood'', a name she had also used for her former property in [[Brookville, New York|Brookville]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=Empress&gt;{{cite book |title= American Empress: The Life and Times of Marjorie Merriweather Post |last= Rubin |first= Nancy |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1994|publisher= iUnivers Star, Lincoln, Nebraska (originally published by Villard Books) |location= |isbn= 0-595-30146-0|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arbremont'', with its 36 rooms, had been built in the 1920s by Mrs. Delos A. Blodgett for her daughter, Helen Blodgett Erwin.  After Post acquired it from the Erwins, she hired the architect [[Alexander McIlvaine]] to gut and rebuild its interior. The renovations, which included moving the library doors to frame a view of the [[Washington Monument]], were completed in 1956. Showcasing her collections including French, Asian and what Hillwood is most known for - Russian art and religious objects.
[[File:Hillwood Museum Exterior Rear.jpg|right|thumb|A view of the Lunar Lawn and Mansion]]
During her marriage with Davies, who served as the second Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the mid-1930s, she acquired a vast collection of objects from the pre-Bolshevik Russia, including a chandelier from the [[Catherine Palace]] that hung in her breakfast nook, and [[Fabergé]] art works including the [[Twelve Monograms (Fabergé egg)|Twelve Monograms Easter egg]]. Post had her first guests to the house in May 1957 and hosted her first big party there on July 7, 1957. Hillwood quickly gained a reputation as one of Washington's "most extraordinary estates."&lt;ref name=Empress/&gt;

As a tribute to Post after her 70th birthday, 181 of her friends built "Friendship Walk," a path from Hillwood's rose garden to a crest overlooking Rock Creek Park.&lt;ref name=Empress/&gt;

Concerned with Hillwood's fate after her death, Post arranged in 1962 to bequeath the estate, along with a $10 million endowment to maintain it, to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] so that it might be maintained as a museum. She made the bequest of Hillwood (as well as most of her other properties) contingent upon its being maintained and used according to her wishes (which included the condition that the estate not be used for dining), and she established the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of the District of Columbia to ensure compliance: any property improperly used would revert to the Foundation. Post was residing at Hillwood when she died on September 12, 1973.&lt;ref name=Empress/&gt;

The Smithsonian declined to make the changes needed to convert Hillwood to a museum, and complained that by 1975 the endowment, producing $450,000 annual income, was insufficient to maintain the site. Accordingly, Hillwood and the majority of the collection was returned to the Post Foundation by April 1976.&lt;ref name=Empress/&gt;

Hillwood is now maintained by the Post Foundation as the ''Hillwood Museum and Gardens'', showcasing [[French Rococo and Neoclassicism|18th]] and [[French art of the 19th century|19th century French art]] and art treasures from [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

==Collections==

Hillwood features over 17,000 objects from the original collection and selected objects collected after Post's death. Collection highlights include:
[[File:Isabella Louise Elisabeth de Parma.jpg|right|thumb|''The Duchess of Parma and Her Daughter'' by Jean-March Nattier]]

* ''The Duchess of Parma and Her Daughter'' by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]].
* ''The Countess Samoilova and Her Foster Daughter'' by [[Karl Briullov]], 1834.

* ''Mrs. Post Portrait'' by [[Douglas Chandor]], 1952.

Hillwood offers appointment-only access to their Art Research Library, which features a notable selection of Russian and European decorative art books and documents.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

==Gardens and grounds==

In 1926, landscape architect [[Willard Gebhart]] designed Hillwood, creating a landscape molded around the twenty-five acres owned by Post. When renovating Hillwood, Post incorporated many of the garden designs into her interior design. Creating the 'garden rooms' which feature touches unique to the Lunar Lawn and Rose Garden. Post's breakfast nook even includes an inside garden of [[orchid]]s, bringing the outside in.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Motor Court===

The first area of arrival for guests, who were escorted into the house by her [[butler]]. The [[elliptical]] shape of the area allowed for an easy stream of cars in and out of the property. [[Azalea]]s, [[dogwood]]s, and [[camellia]]s surround the area. The center of the court features a statue of a young [[Eros]] surrounded by [[English ivy]] and [[Buxus|boxwoods]]. Eros holds a goat and pulls an arrow from his quiver, representing fertility and love. The Motor Court was designed by [[Innocenti and Webel]].&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===French Parterre===
[[File:Hillwood Estate 3.JPG|right|thumb|A view of the mansion from the French Parterre]]
Following the tradition of [[parterre]] gardens, the Hillwood parterre is a formal garden with low detailed plantings that are divided with footpaths and walls of English ivy. Again designed by Innocenti and Webel, the garden was split into four areas using channels of moving water, gravel footpaths and a central pool that is lined with Italian glass tile. A [[terra-cotta]] sculpture of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] overlooks the garden. She is accompanied by marble [[sphinx]]es, a [[cherub]] riding sea animals in the central pool, as well as outdoor furniture from Post's collection. This garden serves as a Post's tribute to 18th-century French aristocracy.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Rose Garden===

In 1956 Post hired [[Perry Hunt Wheeler]], who designed the [[White House]] rose garden, to update the rose garden to her current tastes. Each bed is planted with a single variety of [[Floribunda (rose)|floribunda rose]] which bloom in the summer. A wood and brick [[pergola]] travels through the rose garden with [[rose|climbing roses]] and [[Wisteria|white wisteria]], which is finished with boxwood. [[tulip]]s and [[Lobularia maritima|sweet alyssum]] also decorate the garden.

The rose garden also serves as the location of Post's ashes, which are placed in the base of a pink granite monument that is topped with an antique urn made of deep purple [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. The monument features her coat of arms and the inscription, in Latin, that translates as "All my hopes rest in me."&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Friendship Walk===

A simple English inspired garden walk was a gift to Post from her friends in 1957. Lined with boxwood, [[rhododendron]]s and [[azalea]]s.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Four Seasons Overlook===

An additional gift from her friends in 1957, four statues representing the seasons stand in a circular overlook surrounded by trees such as [[magnolia]], dogwood, [[cherry tree|cherry]], and [[crape myrtle]]. Each statue base has a plaque with the names of friends who contributed the gift gardens. The center stone of the walkway features an inscription from a postcard by [[Tsarina Alexandra Feoderovna]] stating "Friendship outstays the hurrying flight of years and aye abides through laughter and through tears."&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Putting Green===

A putting green, frequently used by Post, consists of closely cut [[Agrostis|bentgrass]] which is surrounded by [[Japanese holly]]. Magnolias and [[viburnum]] surround the area as well.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;
[[File:Hillwood Estate 8.JPG|right|thumb|The putting green]]

===Lunar Lawn===

Named after its crescent shaped design, the Lunar Lawn served as the scene of parties and special events during warm weather months at Hillwood. Events were hosted for the likes of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]]. The [[Washington Monument]] is visible from the lawn, which is framed by [[American elm]]s. Evergreen, [[false cypress]], azaleas, camellias, dogwoods and magnolia are also found in the Lunar Lawn. Every season the horticulture staff rotates out flowers, a tradition set by Post. Tulips in the spring, annuals in the summer, chrysanthemums in the fall and pansies in the winter are planted.

A large statue of a lion, dating from early 18th century England, rests towards the house. 1960s blue and white lawn furniture is placed on the lawn during warm weather months adding a modern twist to an often historical seeming outdoor environment. A gold gilt swan fountain is placed on one wall, and [[satyr]]s stand near the terrace.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Japanese-Style garden===
[[File:Hillwood Estate 10.JPG|left|thumb|Japanese-Style Garden]]
The entrance to the Japanese garden features stone guard dogs and a tall granite lantern. A stream cascades along the hillside and pools appear as well, with stones placed in them to provide safe crossing. A figurine of [[Hotei]], a small sculpture of a tortoise and small [[Tōrō]]s are found throughout. Designed by landscape architect [[Shogo Myaida]], the garden combines native and Japanese plants including [[Japanese Red Pine|Japanese pines]], [[Colorado blue spruce]], maples, azaleas, and false cypress.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Pet cemetery===

Post lived with numerous pet dogs throughout her lifetime and chose to memorialize them on the Hillwood grounds. [[Dogtooth violet]]s, [[sweetbox]] and groundcover surround limestone memorials of [[poodle]]s, [[hound]]s and [[spaniel]]s. The last burial that took place in the cemetery was in 1972, Post's [[schnauzer]] Scampi.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Dacha===

Amongst the gardens and woods is a [[dacha]] built in 1969, representational of pre-Cold War Russian culture. Surrounded by rhododendrons and azaleas, the building features whole-log architecture and detail carvings around the windows and door. The building houses changing exhibitions.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Cutting garden and greenhouse===

The cutting gardens serve as the Hillwood's main source for fresh flowers, as per Post's desire to have fresh flower arrangements throughout the house and grounds year round. The selection of flowers dates back to the 1950s, while the greenhouse was rebuilt in 1996 and looks as it did when Post was alive. The greenhouse serves as horticulture staff offices, work spaces, and home to Hillwoods famous collection of [[orchid]]s.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

===Adirondack Building===

Representative of Post's retreat, Camp Topridge in the [[Adirondack Mountains]], the building, which was built ten years after Post's death, serves as a museum programming venue.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

The Hillwood established an advisory committee in 2001 for the [[GLBT|gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender]] community of Washington, D.C. The estate hosts events such as "Gay Day," gay friendly concerts and film nights. Working closely with major events such as Gay Pride and numerous non-profit queer organizations in the region, the Hillwood serves as one of the few cultural institutions reaching out to the LGBT community. In 2007 the estate was awarded the Ally of the Year Award by the D.C. LGBT Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="GLBT"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=The GLBT Community and Hillwood  | work=About Us | publisher=Hillwood Estate | url=http://www.hillwoodmuseum.org/GLBT/GLBTnew.htm | accessdate= 3 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hillwood Café==

A contemporary cafe with European-inspired fare is located on the grounds, open for lunch and Sunday [[afternoon tea]]. The restaurant also provides free picnic blankets for dining on the garden grounds.&lt;ref name="TourBook"/&gt;

Huacos are not mere [[earthenware]] but notable pottery specimens linked to ceremonial, religious, artistic or aesthetic uses in central [[Andes|Andean]], pre-Columbian civilizations.

The [[Huari culture|Huari]] (Wari), along with the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], the [[Moche culture|Moche]] and others, were among the major creators of figurines who passed down through history their unique skills in ceramics. The Incas, who absorbed all the cultures in the time of its expansion, also produced huacos.

==Etymology==
Since the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], these types of pieces have been found in pre-Columbian sites like [[temple]]s, [[Grave (burial)|graves]] and burials, as well as other kinds of [[ruin]]s. These sites, especially if they are of a sacred meaning, are called generic '''[[huaca]]''' or ''waqa'' in native [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], where it is likely that the figurines take their name. In Peru, a '''huaquero''' is a person that digs in ancient [[pre-Columbian]] ruins illegally in order to get valuable pieces of artwork, usually destroying the structure.

==Variety of styles and colors==
The bridge handles are characteristic of some cultures; some used many colors, while others used black and dull red or few colors.  [[Inca Empire]] adopted all sorts of shapes, styles and qualities. The term "huaco" was reserved for any copies not reserved for daily use but the luxury or ritual.

Normally these ceramic pieces are associated with notable features. Sculptured figurines depict complex, stylized volumes, including cultural scenes, buildings, and naturalistic volumes such as portrait ceramics representing human faces (for example, the [[Moche Portrait Ceramic]]) or body parts by way of [[votive offering]], erotica, tools, various fruits and foods, animals, etc.

When the pieces are sculptural ceramics, huacos are characterized by pictorial richness. There are many kinds of pots and containers covered with gaudy polychrome motifs, usually anthropomorphic representations of animals or mythological, erotica, etc. Two-toned [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery is characterized by complex painted scenes detailing a narrative level. Examples of erotic huacos ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''huacos eróticos''), make the Moche's 800-year period (''c.'' 200 BC to ''c.'' 600 AD) the longest unbroken erotic ceramics tradition in the world, unique in the history of mankind.&lt;ref name="SexPot"&gt;{{Cite book | last= Mathieu | first= Paul |author2=Catherine Hess | title= Sex Pots: Eroticism in Ceramics | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q6oP8nM5EoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | accessdate= 1 December 2009 | origyear= 2003 | year= 2003 | publisher=  Rutgers University Press | location= New Brunswick, New Jersey | isbn=0-8135-3293-0 | page =22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s during the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo]] and his clerical advisers worked to destroy many erotic huacos, though some extant artifacts have survived.

In both cases the huaco is associated with ceramic complexity (in its volume or decoration) and not with regular use as a container on account of  its physical dimensions. The slender Incan vessels known as ''aryballos'', even opulently created examples, are not usually considered ''huacos'' since their utilitarian character is too pronounced.

==Museum exhibits==
The [[National Museum of the Archaeology, Anthropology, and History of Peru]] in [[Lima, Peru]] houses a large number of ceramic artifacts. The nearby [[Larco Museum]] houses a large collection of Moche ceramics and is well known for its collection of erotic pottery.

[[Image:IslamAndTheWest.jpg|thumb|150px|right| ''Islam and the West'']]

'''''Islam and the West''''' is a 1993 [[book]] written by Middle-East historian and scholar [[Bernard Lewis]].

The book deals with the relations between Islam and [[Western civilization]]. It is divided into 3 sections.
The first section treats the history of the interactions between Europe and the [[Islamic world]]. The second section is concerned with the perceptions arising from these interactions by both societies. The third and final section is concerned with Islamic responses and reactions in earlier and recent times.

== Quote from the author ==
{{quote|Historians in free countries have a moral and professional obligation not to shirk the difficult issues and subjects that some people would place under a sort of taboo; not to submit to voluntary censorship, but to deal with these matters fairly, honestly, without apologetics, without polemic, and, of course, competently. Those who enjoy freedom have a moral obligation to use that freedom for those who do not possess it. We live in a time when great efforts have been made, and continue to be made, to falsify the record of the past and to make history a tool of propaganda; when governments, religious movements, political parties, and sectional groups of every kind are busy rewriting history as they would wish it to have been, as they would like their followers to believe that it was. All this is very dangerous indeed, to ourselves and to others, however we may define otherness -- dangerous to our common humanity. Because, make no mistake, those who are unwilling to confront the past will be unable to understand the present and unfit to face the future.}}

==The Question of Orientalism==

===Summary===
This chapter contains an exploration of the meaning of orientalism. It is argued that the word orientalism was until relatively recently used mainly in two senses, to denote either a branch of scholarship or a school of painting. However Lewis contends that it has now been given a new meaning, "that of unsympathetic or hostile treatment of oriental peoples." (p100).

The historical beginnings of oriental scholarship in Western Europe are dated to the time of the [[Renaissance]]. Its history is then traced from relatively narrow roots where one discipline, [[philology]], recovered, studied, published and interpreted texts relating to one region, that which is now called the [[Middle East]], to its gradual expansion to include other disciplines such as [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[literature]] and [[history]] and a diversity of areas from the [[Ottoman Empire]] to India and China.

Having reached a point where the multi-disciplinary approaches and the sheer number of regions under study rendered the term orientalist obsolete Lewis argues it was in effect formally abandoned by those he terms accredited orientalists at the 29th International Congress of Orientalists in 1973. Lewis laments that although the term has now been revived its usage has changed to that of a term of polemic abuse.

An exploration of the rise of anti-orientalism follows where critics from a diversity of sources ranging from Islamicists to Arab Nationalists to Marxist theorists are briefly considered before Lewis concludes by identifying its main exponent in the United States, [[Edward Said]].

A significant proportion of the remainder of the chapter is devoted to a critique of Said's book [[Orientalism]] published in 1978. Lewis attributes the success of Said's book to its [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] stance, its use of, "the ideas, and still more the language of currently fashionable literary, philosophical and political theories." (p114) and its apparent simplification of complex problems.

Finally the chapter concludes with a brief review of the counter-critique from Arab writers such as the Egyptian philosopher Fu'ad Zakana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">'''Merovingian illumination''' is the term for the continental [[Franks|Frankish]] style of [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] in the late seventh and eight centuries, named for the [[Merovingian dynasty]]. Ornamental in form, the style consists of [[initial]]s constructed from lines and circles based on [[Late Antique illumination]], title pages with [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and crucifixes. Figural images were almost totally absent. From the eight century, [[zoomorphic]] decoration began to appear and become so dominant that in some manuscripts from [[Chelles Abbey|Chelles]] whole pages are made up of letters formed from animals. Unlike the contemporary [[Insular illumination]] with its rampant decoration, the Merovingian style aims for a clean page.

One of the oldest and most productive scriptoria was [[Luxeuil Abbey]], founded by the Irish monk [[Columbanus]] in 590 and destroyed in 732. [[Corbie Abbey]], founded in 662, developed its own version of the style, while Chelles and [[Laon]] were further centres. From the middle of the eighth century, Merovingian illumination was strongly influenced by insular illumination. An [[evangeliary]] from [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach]] (Trier, Dombibliothek, Cod. 61 olim 134.) indicates that it came into the abbey as the collaborative work of Irish and Merovingian scribes. The foundation of [[Willibrord]] strongly influenced continental illumination and led to the brought Irish culture into the Merovingian realm.

The first complete translation into English was published in 1799. The second, by John T. Goldthwait, was published in 1960 by the [[University of California Press]].

== Section One ==
''Of the Distinct Objects of the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Kant states that feelings of enjoyment are subjective. In this book, he describes his observations. His interest is not in coarse, thoughtless feelings or in the other extreme, the finest feelings of intellectual discovery. Instead, he writes about the finer feelings, which are intermediate. These require some sensitivity, intellectual excellence, talent, or virtue.

There are two kinds of finer feeling: the feeling of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the feeling of the beautiful. Kant gives examples of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of feelings of the beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. Feelings of the sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.

In this section, Kant gives many particular examples of feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Feelings of the beautiful "occasion a pleasant sensation but one that is joyous and smiling." On the other hand, feelings of the sublime "arouse enjoyment but with horror."

Kant subdivided the sublime into three kinds. The feeling of the terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread or melancholy. The feeling of the noble sublime is quiet wonder. Feelings of the splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.

== Section Two ==
''Of the Attributes of the Beautiful and Sublime in Man in General''

Kant described the relationship between these finer feelings and humanity. The feelings are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs the feeling of the sublime. Comedy arouses feelings for beauty. The personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.

Human nature has many variations of the feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Some variations of the terrifying sublime are the adventurous and grotesque. Visionaries and cranks are persons who have fantasies and whims. The beautiful, when it degenerates, produces triflers, fops, dandies, chatterers, silliness, bores, and fools.

Sympathy or compassion and also good-natured agreeableness are not true virtues, according to Kant. True virtue is the quality of raising the feeling of humanity's beauty and dignity to a principle. When a person acts in accordance with this principle, regardless of inclination, that person is truly and sublimely virtuous.

"A profound feeling for the beauty and dignity of human nature and a firmness and determination of the mind to refer all one's actions to this as to a universal ground is earnest, and does not at all join with a changeable gaiety nor with the inconstancy of a frivolous person." With this observation, Kant will attempt to fit the various feelings of the beautiful and sublime, and the resulting moral characters, into [[Galen]]'s rigid arrangement of [[the four humours]] or human [[temperament]]s: [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]], [[choleric]], and [[phlegmatic]].

Kant asserted that the human temperaments or dispositions are  fixed and separate characters. An individual who has one frame of mind has no feeling or sense for the finer feelings that occur in a person of another temperament. 
*A person who has a constitution that is melancholic will have a predominating feeling for the sublime. That person may possess genuine virtue based on the principle that humanity has beauty and worth.
*One who has a sanguine nature will mostly have a feeling for the beautiful. This results in an "adoptive" virtue that rests on goodheartedness. This person's compassion and sympathy depend on the impression of the moment.
*A choleric human will have a feeling for the splendid or showy sublime. As a result, this person will possess an apparent virtue. Kant calls it "a gloss of virtue." This includes a sense of honor and concern for outward appearance.
*Phlegmatic people have apathy or lack of any finer feeling. They therefore may have an absence of virtue.
As a whole, human nature in general is a combination of these virtues. As such, it is a splendid expression of beauty and dignity.

== Section Three ==
''Of the Distinction of the Beautiful and Sublime in the Interrelations of the Two Sexes''

In Section Three, Kant asserts that women predominantly have feelings for all that is beautiful. Men, on the contrary, have mostly feelings for the sublime. Any other feelings that are only for the enhancement of the main feeling. Kant admits, though, that the distinction is not absolute. Since "we are dealing with human beings; we must also remember that they are not all alike."

Kant helps to root notions of inequality in the Western social structure.  For example, Kant argues that "a woman is little embarrassed that she does not possess high insights; she is beautiful and captivates, and that is enough ... Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroys the merits that are proper to her sex."

Women's mental ability and understanding, then, refer to the beautiful. Men's deep, noble understanding is not suitable for women. Women have beautiful virtues such as kindness and benevolence. Men's virtue is noble and has to do with principles and duty. Because a woman is concerned with the beautiful, the worst that can be said against her is that she is disgusting. A man's greatest defect, however, would be that he is ridiculous, as this is the opposite of the sublime.

In sexual selection, a woman demands that the man have noble and sublime characteristics. A man wants a woman to possess beautiful qualities. In a marriage, the husband and wife unite their disparate attributes to form, as it were, a single moral person. The man's understanding combines with the wife's taste to constitute a union.

== Section Four ==
''Of National Characteristics, so far as They Depend upon the Distinct Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Here Kant describes the different ways that various people have finer feelings. He qualifies his remarks by stating, "[W]hether these national differences are contingent and depend upon the times and the type of government, or are bound by a certain necessity to the climate, I do not here inquire."

The [[Italy|Italians]] have a strong feeling for the beautiful with some mixture of the thoughtful sublime. The French have mostly a feeling for the beautiful, but with the addition of the joyful sublime. The feeling of the Germans is an almost equal blend of both the beautiful and the splendid sublime in that they are much concerned with outward appearances. The feeling of the noble sublime predominates with the English, whose actions are guided by principles rather than impulses. With their cruel [[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]] and harsh conquests, the [[Spaniard]]s have feeling for the terrifying sublime. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] people in [[Holland]] have no finer taste and are concerned only with what is useful. [[Arab]]s are like the Spaniards. [[Persian people|Persian]]s resemble the French. The [[Japan]]ese are the Englishmen of the [[Orient]]. West India displays its love of the grotesque sublime, as also do the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. [[Africa]]n [[Negro]]es possess no finer feelings. [[North America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], however, have a feeling for the sublime in that they are adventurous, honorable, truthful, proud, brave, and valorous.

In antiquity, the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had remarkable feelings for both the beautiful and the sublime. However, with the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], this decayed into a love of false glitter. The subsequent [[barbarian]] [[goths|Gothic]] civilization had an overpowering feeling for the grotesque. Kant claimed that his time witnessed "the sound taste of the beautiful and noble blossoming forth both in the arts and sciences and in respect to morals." He declared that it is necessary to educate the younger generation so that they will have noble simplicity, high morals, and finer feelings.

'''Originality''' is the aspect of created or invented works as being new or novel, and thus distinguishable from [[replica|reproductions]], clones, [[forgery|forgeries]], or [[derivative work]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=and clarify how or if this differs from the legal concept}} 
An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based upon the work of others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. It is a work created with a unique style and substance.
The term "originality" is often applied as a compliment to the [[creativity]] of [[artist]]s, [[writer]]s, and [[Intellectual|thinker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The modern idea of originality is tied to [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1997) pp. 12-13 quote: {{quotation|Modernist concern with issues of originality develops out of modernism's relation to romanticism, the romantics having invented the notion of originality as we know it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a notion that is often called [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Smith24"&gt;Smith (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterhouse26"&gt;Waterhouse (1926)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macfarlane07"&gt;Macfarlane (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of originality is culturally contingent. At the time of [[Shakespeare]], it was more common to appreciate the similarity with an admired classical work, and Shakespeare himself avoided "unnecessary invention".&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RSC07"&gt;[[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (2007) ''The RSC Shakespeare - William Shakespeare Complete Works'', Introduction to the Comedy of Errors, p. 215 quote: &lt;blockquote&gt;while we applaud difference, Shakespeare's first audiences fovoured likeness: a work was good not because it was original, but because it resembled an admired classical exemplar, which in the case of comedy meant a play by Terence or Plautus&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindey, Alexander (1952) ''Plagiarism and Originality''&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the start of the 18th century that the concept of originality became an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] in [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch, Jack (2002) [http://www.writing-world.com/rights/lynch.shtml ''The Perfectly Acceptable Practice of Literary Theft: Plagiarism, Copyright, and the Eighteenth Century''], in ''[http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/index.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation]'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002–3), pp. 51–54. Also available online since 2006 at ''Writing World''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Young]] (1759) ''Conjectures on Original Composition''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Originality in law==

In law, originality has become an important [[legal concept]] with respect to [[intellectual property]], where creativity and [[invention]] have manifest as [[copyright]]able works.{{clarify|date=July 2009|reason=please explain what it means in law: wikinews at http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.K._National_Portrait_Gallery_threatens_U.S._citizen_with_legal_action_over_Wikimedia_images claims "The legal concept of originality here involves the simple origination of a work from an author, and does not include the notions of novelty or innovation that is often associated with the non-legal meaning of the word." - is this considered correct or not?}}
In the [[patent]] law of the [[United States]] and most other countries, only original [[invention]]s are subject to protection. In addition to being original, inventions submitted for a patent must also be useful and [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|nonobvious]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[United States copyright law]] and the law of many other states, copyrights protect only ''original'' works of authorship, a property which has been historically and legally linked to a concept of "[[creativity]]". A work must pass a [[threshold of originality]] in order to be copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Feist v. Rural]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom]] [[intellectual property]] law, a [[derived work]] can demonstrate originality, and must do so if it is to respect copyright.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Originality under the United States Copyright Law ==

In the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law of the United States]], more specifically under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 17 U.S.C 102], the work that is sought to be protected must satisfy the threshold for [[Threshold of originality|originality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|last=Office|first=U.S. Copyright|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of the countries require certain degree of [[Threshold of originality|originality]] in the work sought to be protected, such requirement does not stem from either the [[Berne Convention]] or the [[TRIPS Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ta_docs_e/modules2_e.pdf|last=Module 2, Copyright and Related Rights|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is no uniformity in the standard for [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. In the [[United States]], [[Threshold of originality|originality]] necessitates bare minimum degree of creativity and independent creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#The_Concept_of_Originality|title=Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law - Copyright for Librarians|website=cyber.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the case of '''''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co]].'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/|title=Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; held that the work must be independently created and must possess minimum degree of creativity. This interpretation requires an extremely low level of creativity and in the words of the court, “must possess some creative spark no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/|title=Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also took the opportunity to reject the previously judicially-established and followed the ''[[sweat of the brow]]'' doctrine. According to the said doctrine, labour and hard-work alone could suffice to establish [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. After the dosctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1991, in the [[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.|'''''Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp''''']]&lt;ref&gt;36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; ''case'', the court held that the copies of public domain photographs could not be copyrighted since they lacked [[Threshold of originality|originality]] and while such reproductions may have involved skill and labour, no protection could be granted to them, on account of lack of [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. 

While the current legal requirements of [[Threshold of originality|originality]] viz. minimum level of creativity and independent labour can be easily assessed and applied in case of literary works, the courts are required to undertake a deeper legal and factual inquiry in photographic works. The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court for Southern District of New York]] in '''''[https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/cx/2005_Mannion.pdf Mannion v. Coors Brewing Company]'''''&lt;ref&gt;377 F.Supp.2d 444&lt;/ref&gt; considered originality in terms of timing, subject and rendition, and held that the nature and extent of the copyright would be independent in the three aspects. The requirement for [[Threshold of originality|originality]] was incorporated in the statute only in the Copyright Act, 1976 and over the course of time, the courts have evolved various metrics to apply the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/originality-requirements.html|title=Originality Requirements under U.S. and E.U. Copyright Law - Software Freedom Law Center|website=softwarefreedom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike, [[Novelty (patent)|Patents]], novelty is not required for a work to be considered as original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102|title=35 U.S. Code § 102 - Conditions for patentability; novelty|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/81/49/1475281/ '''''Sheldon (1936)''''']&lt;ref&gt;'''81 F.2d 49 (2d Cir. 1936)''' &lt;/ref&gt; had clarified that sometimes it is relevant for other purposes. Therefore, if the work created by you is identical to a pre-existing work but you are unaware of the latter's existence, you may still enjoy copyright protection for your work. 

Apart from novelty, the work is not required to be made with an intent to be original.  What is considered is only that it is actually an independent creation in effect. In 1951, the court in '''''[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/191/99/91570/ Alfred Bell Co. v. Catalda Arts]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/1775|title=Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; held that the question as to whether there was intent to be original was not to be considered. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has also clarified that it is not necessary for the work to be artistic to qualify as original.  Furthermore, in the landmark ruling, the court observed that it would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Monet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. This observation was an embodiment of the principle of artistic or aesthetic neutrality which seeks to eliminate the inherent subjectivity involved in the judges deciding whether the work is artistic, and hence, the question as to whether it warrants protection.  The principle finds four broad justifications- (i) lack of expertise in the judges (ii) fear of elitism (iii) fear of paternalism (also called parentalism) (iv) lack of consensus on what constitutes art.  However, scholars note that the principle of aesthetic neutrality is often violated as the adjudicators end up favouring creators of what they believe is deserving of copyright grant.

In the United States, the work is not required to be non-commercial in nature for copyright protection and unlike the US trademark law, the work need to be necessarily lawful.  Therefore, works created for commercial purposes, such as advertisements can also be granted a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/originality-requirements.html|title=Originality Requirements under U.S. and E.U.

== Originality Under Indian Copyright Law ==
[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/4010217/ Section 13(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957] mentions 'originality' as a requirement for copyright protection to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Courts have interpreted this requirement of 'originality' in different ways. This has given rise to various doctrines/tests that can be helpful in determining whether a work meets the threshold of originality. The most prominent case with respect to 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Law is the ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1062099/ Eastern Book Company v DCB Modak]''&lt;ref&gt;Appeal (civil)  6472 of 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. This judgment gave rise to two doctrines i.e. ''modicum of creativity'' and the ''skill and judgment test''. This remains the accepted and current position of law in India as of now. However, prior to this, the Indian Courts used to follow the [[Sweat of the brow|Sweat of the Brow]] approach.

=== Sweat of the Brow theory ===
This theory bases the grant of copyright protection on the effort and labour that an author puts into her work as opposed to the creativity involved. [[Labor theory of property|Locke's theory of labour as property]] has often been extended to give jurisprudential basis to this theory of copyright law. In the case of ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1836871/ V. Govindan v E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone,]''&lt;ref&gt;AIR 1955 Mad 391&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that compilations of information would meet the threshold of 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Act since it involves some level of 'skill, labour and brain'.&lt;ref&gt;¶8, V. Govindan vs E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone And Anr. (AIR 1955 Mad 391)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar line of reasoning was adopted in the case of ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/130087/ Burlington Home Shipping Pvt Ltd v Rajnish Chibber]''&lt;ref&gt;1995 IVAD Delhi 732&lt;/ref&gt; where a database was held to be original enough to be protected by copyright under Indian law. However, like in other jurisdictions, this theory was discarded by the Indian Courts also and the focus was shifted to the creativity involved in any work. 

=== EBC Modak Case (Modicum of Creativity &amp; Skill and Judgment Test) ===
The EBC Modak case is the Indian counterpart of the [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|Feist Publications case]] in terms of the test it laid down. It concerned the copyrightability of Supreme Court judgments that were copy-edited and published by Eastern Book Company. These judgments were published along with 'headnotes' that were written by the Company itself. While explicitly discarding the Sweat of the Brow theory, the Court held that simply copy editing would not meet the threshold of originality under copyright law since it would only demonstrate an "''amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy-edited judgments and the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity would be completely excluded.''"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;¶37, ''Eastern Book Company v DB Modak''&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, it introduced the requirement of 'creativity' under originality. With respect to the level of creativity involved, the court adopted the 'minimal degree of creativity' approach. Following this standard, the headnotes that did not copy from the judgment verbatim were held to be copyrightable.

Finally, the Court also gave way to the 'Skill and Judgment Test' which is more or less a compromise between the sweat of the brow theory and the modicum of creativity test. While relying on the [[CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada|CCH Canadian Case]],&lt;ref&gt;[2004] 1 SCR 339&lt;/ref&gt; the Court essentially held that a work would meet the originality standard as long as there is labour or effort involved but not ''only'' labour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It must involve some level of skill and judgment as well. However, this approach mirrors the Sweat of the Brow theory more closely and is therefore a difficult theory to defend. Further, the Court held the division of a judgment into paragraphs and numbering them was enough to meet this standard of 'Skill and Judgment'. Whether this is the correct interpretation of the test as given in the CCH Canadian Case&lt;ref&gt;¶16, CCH Canadian ''Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada'', [2004] 1 SCR 339&lt;/ref&gt; remains debatable. 

== Originality in science ==
[[Scientific literature]] considered as [[primary source|primary]] must contain [[original research]], and even [[review articles]] contain original [[analysis]] or [[Interpretation_(philosophy)#Scientific_interpretation|interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobin|first1=Martin J.|title=Writing a Review Article for AJRCCM|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=October 2003|volume=168|issue=7|pages=732–734|doi=10.1164/rccm.2306019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Originality of ideas and creative works==
An original idea is one not thought up by another person beforehand. Sometimes, two or more people can come up with the same idea independently.

The evaluation of originality depends not only on the creative work itself, but also on the temporal context, the [[zeitgeist]]. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical [[Theme (music)|music themes]], the importance of objective characteristics and the zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its "absolute" originality influenced in similar [[Effect size|magnitude]] the popularity of a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|date=1980|title=Thematic fame, melodic originality, and musical zeitgeist: A biographical and transhistorical content analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/38/6/972|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=972–983|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.6.972|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jocb.230|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230|issn=0022-0175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original recording==
An original [[painting]], [[photographic negative]], [[Analog recording|analog]] audio, or video recording, will contain qualities that can be difficult, or under current technology may be impossible to [[Copying|copy]] in its full integrity. That can also apply for any other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]].

That is why it is often necessary to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] the original, in order to preserve its original integrity. The copy is made to preserve the original recording by saving the original from degenerating as it is being played, rather than to replace the original.

'''Pauline Campanelli''' (1943{{ndash}}2001) was an American artist who specialized in [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] [[still life]]s. Though her work did not often attract prestigious galleries or museums, only [[Andrew Wyeth]] sold more paintings while living than she did. Her top selling print, “Rose Berries” sold almost one million copies. In addition to painting, she wrote books on ancient pre-Christian rituals.

==Biography==
Pauline Eblé was born on January 25, 1943 in [[The Bronx]], New York. At the age of 3 she contracted [[polio]], spending a year in an [[iron lung]] and another year and a half in a hospital. She was home schooled with college texts until she was aged 13 and then attended high school in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]]. After graduating, she attended the [[Ridgewood School of Art]]&lt;ref name="biography obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Pauline Campanelli, 58, Artist Who Evoked Rustic Simplicity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/14/nyregion/pauline-campanelli-58-artist-who-evoked-rustic-simplicity.html|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2001|location=New York City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Art Students League of New York]].&lt;ref name=style&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli|url=http://nygs.com/artist/c/campanelli_pauline.html|website=New York Graphic Society|publisher=New York Graphic Society|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=New York City, New York|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726205156/http://nygs.com/artist/c/campanelli_pauline.html|archivedate=26 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campanelli's style was known as superrealism or [[photorealism]] and she was most known for her [[still life]]s&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Pauline-Eble-Campanelli|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ordinary objects found in nature like fossils, shells, bird's nests and the like.&lt;ref name=style /&gt; She was influenced by [[Piet Mondrian]] as well as [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects|naturalism]] and her belief in [[paganism]].&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; She was a meticulous painter, who strove to complete minute details accurately. Early in her career, she produced nearly twenty paintings per year, but after 1990, six per year was her average.&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Carol|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli, 58, Artist and Antiques Writer|url=http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/pauline-eble-campanelli-58-artist-and-antiques-writer/|website=Antiques and the Arts Weekly|publisher=The Bee Publishing|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=Newtown, CT|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, she sold more paintings as a living artist than any painter except [[Andrew Wyeth]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and her top-selling print, ''Wild Rose Berries'', sold almost one million copies.&lt;ref name=tribute /&gt;

In 1969, Eblé married fellow painter Dan Campanelli and they made their living from teaching art classes and selling paintings. In 1976, they bought a stone farmhouse in New Jersey which was abandoned and had no electricity. As they were unable to obtain financing and had no savings, they restored the building themselves with hand tools. Eblé-Campanelli abandoned her wheelchair for hands and knees and refinished the floors, while Dan worked on the sagging structure. They pressed grapes in an antique fruit press, making their own wine;  Eblé-Campanelli canned 400 jars of fruit annually; and she spun fleece from their Dorset sheep into yarn for projects.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; Their work and home was featured in ''Colonial Homes'' in the March/April 1981 issue and ''Country Living Magazine'' in April 1985. That same year, the New Jersey Network produced a [[PBS]] program on their artwork and life for television.&lt;ref name="television and books"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Campanelli|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/author.php?author_id=385|website=Llewellyn|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide Ltd.|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=Woodbury, Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Eblé-Campanelli and her husband studied witchcraft and pre-Christian rituals to understand ancient practices and bring an appreciation to their rustic life.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; She researched and wrote books, publishing her first volume, ''Wheel of the Year: Living the Magical Life'' in 1989.&lt;ref name="television and books" /&gt; Her most popular book, ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (1991) sold more than 40,000 copies.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt;

Campanelli died November 29, 2001 at her home near Phillipsburg, in [[Pohatcong Township, New Jersey]] from complications of her polio.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt;

East-West/West-East consists of four steel plates measured by their relation to the topography. The plates, which rise to 14.7 meters and 16.7 meters above the ground, are level to each other; they are also level to the gypsum plateaus on either side. Despite the great distance that the plates span, all four can be seen and explored from either end of the sculpture.

==''Buscando la luz IV'' by Eduardo Chillida==
Qatar Museums unveils Public Art commission by the Basque artist [[Eduardo Chillida]] at [[Qatar University]], Doha, [[Qatar]]. ''Buscando la luz IV'' (Searching for Light IV) is the last among a series of sculptures of monumental scale produced by Chillida throughout his final creative period. The abstract piece integrates in itself the fundamental concepts inside the artist’s labor. The dialogue between matter and space; the creation of sites; the organic nature of forms; and a strong ethical content are all notions that conform Chillida’s body of work. The three asymmetrical steel plates that compose the sculpture are linked to each other through a complex riveting system, which delimitates in its interior a place for human encounters. The artist plays with the scale and invites us to enter the interior space of the work. Once inside, its undulant forms appear to acquire movement, raising up in search of the light.

'''''Roses, Convolvulus, Poppies and Other Flowers in an Urn on a Stone Ledge''''' (1688) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Rachel Ruysch]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]].

Ruysch has been recorded as making pendant paintings, with one painting of flowers (called a "bloemstuk") and another of fruit ("fruitstuk"), often on a forest floor. A pendant to this painting is unknown. Various attempts have been made to "read" her paintings in terms of the plants and insects shown in them, but generally they were simply treasured for their beauty and "cleverness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wpgjm A Flower Painting by Rachel Ruysch], 28 minute discussion of this painting on BBC Radio 4&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting there are several botanically correct plants, with various insects on them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was gifted in 1986 by [[Wilhelmina Holladay]]. Its provenance doesn't go further back than an advertisement by Alan Jacobs Gallery Ltd., London, in 1984. This is typical for flower still life paintings: once they leave a collection, descriptions of them are too varied to pinpoint them exactly, and Ruysch's production was unusually high for a woman painter, mostly because she remained productive throughout her (very long) life.

Other "Flowers in a vase on a ledge" paintings by Ruysch are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1687">'''Samuel Jesi''' (1789 – January 17, 1853) was an Italian engraver.

He was born in [[Milan]] in 1789, he was a pupil of [[Giuseppe Longhi]] at the [[Brera Academy]] of Milan. His first work (1821) was "The Abandonment of Hagar", engraved after a painting by [[Guercino]] in the Palazzo di Brera at Milan; this was followed (1834) by "The Madonna with St. John and St. Stephen", from a painting by [[Fra Bartolomeo]] in the [[Cathedral of Lucca]]. He then devoted himself to the works of [[Raphael]], whom he ably interpreted. His masterpiece is the group representing [[Pope Leo X]] with Cardinals Rossi and [[Giulio dei Medici]] (1834). While in Paris for the purpose of having it printed he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and received the ribbon of the [[Legion of Honor]]. In 1846 he began to work on his engraving of the "Cœna Domini", discovered in the Church of S. Onofrio, Florence, and attributed to Raphael. Meanwhile, he engraved the "Madonna della Vite." In 1849 he completed the drawing of the "Cœna Domini", but died in [[Florence]] before finishing the engraving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">A '''script coordinator''' is a role in the production of a [[film]] or [[television program|television series]]. The script coordinator is responsible for producing each [[draft document|draft]] of the [[screenplay|script]] and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.

On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and [[Film_production#Production|production]] departments. The writers deliver the first [[draft document|draft]] of a [[screenplay|script]] to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the [[screenplay|script]] for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-script-coordinator-do.htm wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script coordinator must check the [[draft document|draft]] for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the [[draft document|draft]]. Once a [[screenplay|script]] has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the [[screenplay|script]]. The process of how widely each [[draft document|draft]] is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com/2012/07/5-questions-with-writers-assistant-and.html aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the [[screenplay|script]] and again check the [[screenplay|script]] for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a [[Bible (writing)|show bible]] that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. 

A script coordinator is a distinct role from [[script supervisor]]. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the [[screenplay|script]] for editing purposes rather than [[pre-production]] coordination of the [[screenplay|script]] to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time [[screenwriter]] is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

The '''Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark''' ({{lang-it|Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco}}), commonly known as '''Saint Mark's Basilica''' ({{lang-it|Basilica di San Marco}}; {{lang-vec|Baxéłega de San Marco}}), is the [[cathedral]] church of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], northern [[Italy]]. It is the most famous of the city's churches and one of the best known examples of Italo-[[Byzantine architecture]]. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Piazza San Marco]], adjacent and connected to the [[Doge's Palace]]. Originally it was the chapel of the Doge, and has been the city's cathedral only since 1807, when it became the seat of the [[Patriarch of Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1&lt;/ref&gt; archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], formerly at [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title =Basilica di San Marco|date =|access-date =10 February 2016|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate =5 March 2015|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its opulent design, gold ground [[mosaic]]s, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building has been known by the nickname '''Chiesa d'Oro''' (Church of gold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7ZNOt6-N0MC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Chiesa+d'Oro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hh_lT4X7BYyk8ATCy_WaAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Chiesa%20d'Oro&amp;f=false|title=Fodor's Italy 2011 |publisher= Random House Digital, Inc.|date= May 31, 2011|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Earliest construction===
[[File:San Marko (reconstruction).JPG|thumb|Original [[facade]] of St. Mark's Basilica]]
[[File:1911 Britannica-Architecture-St Mark’s.png|thumb|Plan diagram, showing different phases of construction]]
The first St Mark's was a building next to the [[Doge's Palace]], ordered by the doge in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of [[Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], and completed by 832; from the same century dates the first [[St Mark's Campanile]] (bell tower). The church was burned in a rebellion in 976, when the populace locked [[Pietro IV Candiano]] inside to kill him, and restored or rebuilt in 978.  Nothing certain is known of the form of these early churches.  From perhaps 1063&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title=Navigation path|website=www.basilicasanmarco.it|accessdate=10 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate=5 March 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the present [[basilica]] was constructed.  The consecration is variously recorded as being in 1084&amp;ndash;85, 1093 (the date most often taken), 1102 and 1117, probably reflecting a series of consecrations of different parts.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:San Marco cathedral in Venice.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the gable showing Venice's patron apostle St. Mark with angels. Underneath is a winged lion, the symbol of the saint and of Venice.]]
In 1094 the supposed body of Saint Mark was rediscovered in a [[Column|pillar]] by [[Vitale Faliero]], [[Doge of Venice|doge]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |title=Recovery |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233823/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |archive-date=4 October 2013 |work=basilicasanmarco.it |access-date=28 July 2013 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing St Mark’s Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace.  The [[Pala d'Oro]] ordered from Constantinople was installed on the [[high altar]] in 1105.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1106 the church, and especially its mosaics, were damaged by a serious fire in that part of the city; it is not entirely clear whether any surviving mosaics in the interior predate this, though there is some 11th-century work surviving in the main porch.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  The main features of the present structure were all in place by then, except for the [[narthex]] or porch, and the [[facade]].

The basic shape of the church has a mixture of Italian and Byzantine features, notably "the treatment of the eastern arm as the termination of a basilican building with main apse and two side chapels rather than as an equal arm of a truly centralized structure".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new facade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the [[dome]]s were covered with second much higher domes of lead-covered wood in order to blend in with the [[Gothic architecture]] of the redesigned Doge's Palace.—

===Later construction===
The basic structure of the building has not been much altered. Its decoration has changed greatly over time, though the overall impression of the interior with a dazzling display of gold ground mosaics on all ceilings and upper walls remains the same. The succeeding centuries, especially the period after the Venetian-led conquest of Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]] of 1204 and the fourteenth century, all contributed to its adornment, with many elements being [[spolia]] brought in from ancient or Byzantine buildings, such as mosaics, [[column]]s, [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], or [[frieze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the exterior [[brickwork]] became covered with [[marble]] cladding and [[Stone carving|carvings]], some much older than the building itself, such as the statue of the Four Tetrarchs (below).
The latest structural additions include the closing-off of the Baptistery and [[Isidore of Chios|St Isidor's]] Chapel (1300s), the carvings on the upper facade and the Sacristy (1400s), and the closing-off of the Zen Chapel (1500s).

===Function and administration===
During the 13th century the emphasis of the church's function seems to have changed from being the private chapel of the Doge to that of a "state church", with increased power for the procurators.  It was the location for the great public ceremonies of the state, such as the installation and burials of Doges, though as space ran out and the demand for grander tombs increased, from the 15th century [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] became the usual burial place. The function of the basilica remained the same until 1807, after the end of the [[Venetian Republic]], when the basilica finally became subject to the local [[bishop]], the [[Patriarch of Venice]], though from the 12th century he had had a throne there, opposite the doge's.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of the see was ordered by [[Napoleon]] during his period of control of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this, Venice's cathedral from 1451 was the much less grand [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].

The ''procurators'', an important organ of the [[Republic of Venice]], were in charge of administration; their seats were the [[Procuratie]], in St Mark’s Square. All building and restoring works were directed by the ''protos'': great [[architect]]s such as [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and [[Baldassarre Longhena]] held the office. The doge himself appointed a special group of clergy led by the ''primicerio''.  Procurators and protos still exist and perform the same tasks for the Patriarchate.

==Exterior==
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3341.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, from the north side of the piazza ([[Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives]] - [[:c:Category:Photographs from the Goodyear Archival Collection|the Goodyear Archival Collection]]).]]
The exterior of the west facade of the basilica is divided in three registers: lower, upper, and [[dome]]s.
In the lower register of the façade, five round-arched [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], enveloped by polychrome marble columns, open into the narthex through bronze-fashioned doors.

The upper level of mosaics in the lunettes of the lateral ogee arches has scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] (all post-Renaissance replacements) culminating in a 19th-century replacement ''[[Last Judgment]]'' lower down over the main portal that replaced a damaged one with the same subject (during the centuries many mosaics had to be replaced inside and outside the basilica, but subjects were rarely changed).

Mosaics with scenes showing the history of the relics of Saint Mark from right to left fill the [[lunette]]s of the lateral portals; the first on the left is the only one on the façade still surviving from the 13th century. The formal subject is the ''Deposition of the Relics'', but it is probably depicted as the crowd leaving San Marco after the ceremonial installation of a new doge. The four bronze horses are shown in their place on the façade. We can for once get a good idea of the original compositions of the mosaics from paintings and other depictions, especially [[Gentile Bellini]]'s very large ''Procession in Piazza San Marco'' in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone sculpture is relatively limited at the lower level, where a forest of columns and patterned marble slabs are the main emphases. It includes relatively narrow bands of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] work on the portals, richly carved borders of foliage mixed with figures to the ogee arches and other elements, and large shallow [[relief]] saints between the arches. Along the roofline, by contrast, there is a line of statues, many in their own small pavilions, culminating in Saint Mark flanked by six angels in the centre, above a large gilded winged lion (his symbol, and that of Venice).

In the upper register, from the top of ogee [[arch]]es, statues of [[Theological virtues|Theological]] and [[Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]], four [[Military saint|Warrior Saints]], [[Constantine X Doukas|Constantine]], [[Demetrius]], [[George the Hagiorite|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodosius]] and St Mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/basilica_scult/coronamento_appr.bsm# |title=The Gothic Crowning|publisher=basilicasanmarco.it |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; watch over the city. Above the large central window of the façade, under St Mark, the Winged Lion (his symbol) holds the book quoting ''“Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus” (Peace to you Mark my evangelist) ''.  In the centre of the balcony the famous bronze horses face the square.

===Horses of Saint Mark-Lysippos===
[[File:Veneza38.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|The replica horses]]
The [[Horses of Saint Mark]] were installed on the balcony above the portal of the basilica in about 1254. They date to [[Classical Antiquity]], though their date remains a matter of debate, and presumably were originally the team pulling a [[quadriga]] chariot, probably containing an emperor. By some accounts they once adorned the Arch of [[Trajan]]{{clarify|date=November 2016 |reason=Which one?}}.

The horses were long displayed at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], and in 1204 Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] sent them back to Venice as part of the loot [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked from Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].

They were taken to Paris by [[Napoleon]] in 1797 but returned to Venice in 1815. After a long restoration, since the 1970s the originals have been kept in St Mark’s Museum inside the basilica and the horses now on the facade of the cathedral are bronze replicas.

[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]] {{3d alt|4 Tetrarchs.jpg}}]]

===The Tetrarchs===
In an attempt to stabilise the Roman Empire after the crisis of the third century, the Emperor [[Diocletian]] imposed a new Imperial office structure: a four co-emperor ruling plan called The [[Tetrarchy]]. The famous [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] statue [[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|of the Four Tetrarchs]] represents the interdependence of the four rulers. It was taken from [[Constantinople]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, and set into the south-west corner of the basilica (the above-mentioned low tower) at the level of the Piazza San Marco. Part of the missing foot of one of the figures was discovered in Istanbul (near the [[Bodrum Mosque]]) in the 1960s, where it is still on display, clarifying the original location of the work.

===Narthex or porch===
By the 13th century, the [[narthex]] or porch embraced the western arm of the basilica on the three sides; when it was first built is uncertain but was probably the 13th century. Later the southern part was closed to obtain the Baptistery (14th century) and the Zen Chapel (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The narthex prepares the visitors’ eyes for the atmosphere of the gilded interior, just as the [[Old Testament]] stories represented in its 13th-century mosaic ceiling prepare them for the New Testament decoration in the interior.  The main subjects are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the life of [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], Joseph, and [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;  It has long been recognised that the compositions are very close to those of the [[Cotton Genesis]], an important 4th- or 5th-century Greek luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] copy of the Book of Genesis, now in the [[British Library]], though very badly damaged in a fire of 1731.  About a hundred of the 359 miniatures in the manuscript are used. It is presumed that this reached Venice after the Fourth Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

On the wall above and at the sides of the main doorway are the [[Four Evangelists]] and saints, 11th-century mosaics, the oldest in the building, that decorated the old facade to St Mark’s even before the narthex was built.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Veneto Venezia2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|View from the main crossing dome to the eastern apse]]
The interior is based on a Greek cross, with each arm divided into three naves with a dome of its own as well as the main dome above the crossing. The dome above the crossing and the western dome are bigger than the other three. This is based on Constantine's Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.

The marble floor (12th century, but underwent many restorations) is entirely tessellated in geometric patterns and animal designs. One particular panel in the pavement shows two [[rooster|cock]]s carrying a trussed-up fox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/39911172@N08/3715513816/|title=Venice Basilica San Marco interior 07 Mural 2 cocks carrying a fox|publisher=[[Flickr]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been interpreted politically by some, as a reference to the French conquest of [[Milan]] in the [[Italian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaHt76Uk2m8C&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=church+two+cocks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3HEdx-atB&amp;sig=Gni4XJfAcPBUCS4P4y-OpdVhUao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJCuTcSJAYLBtgeszcHdAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cocks|title=Venice: A Documentary History, 1450-1630|first=David|last=Sanderson|last2=Chambers|first2=Jennifer|last3=Fletcher|first3=Brian S. Pullan|publisher=Renaissance Society of America|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as a sacred symbol of the faithful wish for immortality, with the victory of the cross, and "analogous to the hope of resurrection, the victory of the soul over death".&lt;ref&gt;The Theme of Cockfighting in Burgundian Romanesque Sculpture, Ilene H. Forsyth&amp;nbsp;– Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies Vol. 53, No. 2 (Apr., 1978), pp. 252–282&amp;nbsp;– Publisher: Medieval Academy of America&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques used were [[opus sectile]] and [[opus tessellatum]].

The lower register of walls and [[Column|pillars]] is completely covered with polychrome [[marble]] slabs. The transition between the lower and the upper register is delimited all around the basilica by passageways which largely substituted the former galleries.

===Mosaics===
The upper levels of the interior are completely covered with bright [[mosaic]]s covering an area of about 8000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The great majority use the traditional background of [[gold glass]] [[tesserae]], creating the shimmering overall effect.  Unfortunately, the Doge retained a workshop of mosaicists until the late 18th century, and in the 19th century contracted a mosaic workshop run by the [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]] glassmaking firm, and the majority of the medieval mosaics have been "restored" by removing and resetting, usually with a considerable loss of quality, so that "only about one-third of the mosaic surface can be regarded as original".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-11, 10 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving work, in the main porch, perhaps dates to as early as 1070, and was probably by a workshop that had left Constantinople in the mid-11th century and worked at [[Torcello Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  They are in "a fairly pure Byzantine style" but in succeeding phases of work Byzantine influence reflecting the latest style of the capital was reduced by stages, disappearing altogether by about the 1130s, after which the style was Italian in essentials, reflecting "a change from a colonial to a local art".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 37-38, 189 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main period of decoration was the 12th century, a period of deteriorating relations between Venice and Byzantium, but very little is known about the process or how it was affected by politics.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|Overview of mosaics, looking east]]
[[File:Mosaico traslazione San Marco Venezia.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of the translation of the body of Saint Mark]]
[[File:Part of the Entrance to St Mark's Basilica in Venice.jpg|250px|thumb|Part of the mosaic at the entrance to St Mark's Basilica.]]
The main work on the interior mosaics was apparently complete by the 1270s, with work on the atrium continuing into the 1290s. After that the St Marks workshop seems to have been disbanded, so that when a fire in 1419 caused serious damage, the only Venetian capable of the work had just died and the [[Signoria of Florence]] had to be asked for help; they sent [[Paolo Uccello]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the restorations tried to retain the medieval compositions and replicate a medieval style, but from 1509 the policy changed and further work was in contemporary styles. From the 1520s a series of Venetian painters were able to get commissions for the replacement of undamaged areas in what was considered to be superior modern style, until from 1610 a number of conservation-minded decrees attempted to restrain the process.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The large and complicated programme of the decoration centres on the seated large [[Christ Pantocrator]] in the main apse (now a 15th-century recreation) above patron saints of Venice. The East dome over the high altar has a bust of Christ in the centre surrounded by standing prophets and the Virgin Mary, with the [[Four Evangelists]] in the [[pendentive]]s. A large and comprehensive cycle of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] occupies much of the roof, with usually extensive coverage for the Middle Ages of his miracles, originally shown in 29 scenes in the transepts. It includes the [[Ascension of Christ]] in the central dome and [[Pentecost]] in the west dome.  The centre is an [[etimasia]] ("empty throne") with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne. Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the "nations", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAUMM3cU_UoC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA240&amp;ots=hD-45Z7Svh&amp;dq=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;pg=RA1-PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;f=false here] for further details]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the miracles the transepts contain cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]] before and during the Infancy of Christ.  As well as many saints, church fathers, virtues and angels, there are scenes from the lives of Saints Mark, Clement, Peter, and John (with many scenes in post-Renaissance versions). The west wall has a 13th-century [[deesis]] below a [[Last Judgement]] in the vault, and a huge [[Tree of Jesse]] was added to the end wall of the north transept in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 10-11 for summary, full coverage in later chapters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the [[iconography]] of the Old Testament cycle in the porch in the Cotton Genesis manuscript has been described above; similar relationships have been traced for parts of the interior mosaics, in particular with the cycle of the Life of the Virgin and Infancy of Christ sharing a common Byzantine model with a [[fresco]] cycle in the cathedral at the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] in [[Pskov]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, restorations and replacements were often necessary thereafter, or done even when not necessary, and great painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jacopo Tintoretto]] and his son [[Domenico Tintoretto|Domenico]] were among those who produced the designs for the mosaicists. [[Titian]] and the [[Padovanino]] prepared the [[cartoon]]s for the sacristy, built in the late 15th century. Other mosaics decorate the Baptistery, the Mascoli Chapel, St Isidor Chapel and the Zen Chapel, which has scenes from the life of St Mark, perhaps from the 1270s, and among the latest work of the original programme to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 179-182&lt;/ref&gt;

===The presbytery===
[[File:Meister der Ikone des Erzengels Michael 001 adjusted.jpg|thumb|10th-century gold and enamel Byzantine [[icon]] of [[St Michael]], in the treasury]]

The eastern arm has a raised [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] with a [[crypt]] beneath. The presbytery is separated by an  [[Rood screen|altar screen]] formed by eight red marble columns crowned with a high Crucifix and statues by [[Pier Paolo Dalle Masegne|Pier Paolo]] and  [[Jacobello Dalle Masegne]], masterpiece of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] sculpture (late 14th century). Behind the screen, marble banisters with Sansovino's bronze statues of the Evangelists and [[Girolamo Paliari|Paliari]]'s of the Four Doctors mark the access to the high [[altar]], which contains St Mark’s relics. Above the high altar is a canopy (“[[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]]”) on columns decorated with fine [[relief]]s. The [[altarpiece]] is the famous [[Pala d'Oro]], a masterpiece of Byzantine craftsmanship, originally designed for an [[antependium]].This masterpiece incorporates 1,300 pearls, 300 sapphires, 300 emeralds, and 400 garnets. They are all original and highly polished, unfaceted gems. The original altar frontal is now in the treasury.  The choir stalls are embellished with inlay by Fra [[Sebastiano Schiavone]], and above them on both sides are three [[relief]]s by Sansovino.

Behind the presbytery are the [[sacristy]] and a 15th-century church consecrated to [[Theodore of Amasea|St Theodore]] (the first patron saint of Venice) where is displayed a painting (Child’s Adoration) by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].

===The treasury===
The treasury contains what is now a unique collection of Byzantine portable objects in metalwork, enamel and [[hardstone carving]], most looted from Constantinople after the Fourth Crusade (although there was a serious fire in the treasury in 1231), with probably a new influx after the "Franks" were expelled in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 65-66, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter most objects were made locally, though there are also important Islamic works, especially in [[rock crystal]], and some from Northern Europe. Selections have toured internationally.

Most of the church plate was ordered to be surrendered to the state immediately after the end of the Venetian Republic in 1797, and was melted down for coining; there were only 141 objects in an inventory ordered by the Austrians in 1816, many in materials that could not be recycled for cash.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Byzantine hardstone vessels in various semi-precious stones is by the most important to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; A glass [[situla (vessel)|situla]] or bucket carved with [[Dionysus|Bacchic]] figures been dated to either the 4th or 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th-century "throne-reliquary" in rather crudely carved [[alabaster]], the ''Sedia di San Marco'', was moved from the high altar to the Treasury in 1534.  It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a "throne-lectern" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the [[hetoimasia]] ("empty throne") images with open books that are found in art of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 98-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasury "now houses the best single collection of Byzantine metalwork, and particularly of enameling, that survives", including two imperial chalices of antique [[sardonyx]] with Byzantine gold and enamel mounts, marked "Romanos", the name of four emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 105&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3345.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, interior looking diagonally to the left transept (Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives - the Goodyear Archival Collection).]]

===Right transept===
On the right of the screen is the platform from which the newly elected doge appeared. In the left aisle are [[Clement of Metz|St Clement]]’s chapel and the Holy Host altar. Here is the pillar where St Mark’s relics were rediscovered in 1094, as depicted in the interesting mosaics of the right aisle (where the entrance to St Mark’s Treasure is)..

===Left transept===
On the left of the screen is the platform for readings from Scripture; on the right aisle are [[St Peter]]’s chapel and the [[commons:File:Nicopeia.jpg|Madonna Nicopeia]], a venerated Byzantine icon. On the northern side are St Isidor’s chapel and the Mascoli chapel.

==Music==
[[File:Venice SMarco Vault2.jpg|thumb|Dome with [[Pentecost]] and [[pendentive]]s with angels]]
{{main|Cappella Marciana}}
The spacious interior of the building with its multiple choir lofts was the inspiration for the development of a [[Venetian polychoral style]] among the composers appointed [[maestro di cappella]] at the [[Cappella Marciana|choir of St Mark's]]. The style was first developed by a foreigner, [[Adrian Willaert]], and was continued by Italian organists and composers: [[Andrea Gabrieli]], his nephew [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]. Their music took advantage of the spacious architecture and led to the development of [[polychoral]] and [[antiphonal]] textures. An example of this technique is found in [[In Ecclesiis]] by Giovanni Gabrieli.

==In scientific discourse==
One of the most well-known and widely cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=8886524888381702203&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en|title=Google Scholar|publisher=Scholar.google.ca|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; papers in biology is "The [[Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm: A Critique of the [[Adaptationist]] Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S.J.|author2=Lewontin, R.C. |authorlink2=Richard Lewontin|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould|title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: A critique of the adaptationist programme|year=1979|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|pmid=42062|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on an analogy between the beautifully decorated spandrels spaced around the domes in the basilica, which sit on four arches (technically, the structures are [[pendentive]]s rather than spandrels), and various biological traits and features. The authors, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]], argue that the spandrels are the inevitable spaces that exist when a dome is placed above arches rather than design elements and that many biological traits are similarly the side effects of functional traits rather than adaptive traits in themselves.

Most of the animal sculptures reach considerable sizes. Some of them stand on pedestal. Sculptures made with great artistic mastery and expression are also met with besides schematically and roughly intagliated sheep and horse figures. Backs and sides of horses and sheep are covered with relief pictures of everyday life scenes, besides inscriptions. Inscriptions carved with [[Arabic script]] are also frequently found on headstones.&lt;ref name="Учение записки"/&gt;

==History of appearance and learning==

Pictures of alive beings in every form were restricted after occupation of the region by [[Arab people|Arabs]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Pictures of alive beings appeared in national arts again. It is considered that headstones were made in forms of sheep and horses beginning from the 15th century. These headstones are considered as an example of restriction of [[Islam]]ic [[dogma]]tics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Pictures of wild goats, deer, in some cases hunting scenes for these animals and sometimes everyday life episodes were also carved on stone sheep, besides the inscriptions.

[[File:Near the horse-gravestone in Shusha.jpg|thumb|300px|Stone sculpture of a horse in [[Shusha]] in [[Vasily Vereshchagin]]'s picture,1865]]
Firstly, a [[France|French]] [[geologist]] Frederic Dubois de Montpereux (1798 – 1850) mentioned about similar sculpture in “Voyage autour du Caucase”. There are materials in “Historie de la Societe nationale des l’antiquite” work of Perrot et Chipiez (Volume V, page 170). Then it was mentioned in works of [[Germans|German]] [[Archaeology|archeologist]] [[Arthur Milchhöfer]] “Archeologische Zeitung” of 1883, in “Bulletin de la Societe nationale des antiquares de France” in 1899 (balance of Turkish cemetery in [[Yerevan]] city) – “Report of Archeological Commission for 1898”. Letters in the southern semitic alphabet carved on sculpture of horse, found out near Dikh village of [[Kurdistan]] region, were opened by E.Y.Resler. A horse sculpture from Tselkinskiy district of [[Tiflis Governorate]] was also mentioned (I.P.Rostomov, [[Akhalkalaki]] uyezd in archeological relations).

In the 1920s, V.M.Sysoyev registered stone sculptures of horses and sheep in following points of [[Absheron peninsula]], on [[Muslim]] cemetery in Zikh village, in Kuturlu village of Kurdistan uyezd, in Muslim cemetery of [[Qarağac, Qubadli|Qarağac]] village of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic]], in Aznaburt, Azi (lower part), Vanand, Danagird (in [[Armenians|Armenian]] cemetery) of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]]’s border, in [[Nakhchivan (city)]], Ananab village, in [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]] in [[Erzincan]], in Abidere, Balaburm Garidy, [[Lerik, Azerbaijan|Lerik]], [[Təngərud|Tangarud]], Eychara villages of [[Lankaran]] uyezd, during the working process on archeological map of [[Azerbaijan]].  Sysoyev also noted that, local residents of [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]], Danagirt and Abrakunis find out these figures in ancient cemeteries, in mountains and other places, attach importance to them, frequently bring them from there and put on graves of their dears. An exemplar of stone sheep was also in park “in the square”, in [[Borjomi]], which was brought from outskirts. In 1925, this sheep was vanished and taken away by the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], during flood of the river. Artistically created figure of sheep was in Barda village near [[Yevlakh]]. Fate of that sheep, a photo of which is kept in archive of the [[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]], is unknown at present.

In 1926, monuments in Urud village of [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur]] district were found out by archeologist A.K.Alakbarov, about which he briefly wrote the following sentences: “There are many sepulchral monuments with pictures of people and inscriptions on sides” in an ancient cemetery of Urud village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Y,Pchelina notes that (1932), such kind of monuments are popular in literature about the South Caucasus and usually are ascribed to [[Armenians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. She emphasizes headstones as “very rough sculptures” of sheep and horses made of gray stone in a cemetery near Yanig Yugoruk sanctuary (between Kizilav and Seyidlar villages on the Hakari river) and also in cemeteries of Shalva, [[Minkend]], Gara-Gishlag villages. Pchelina describes these sculptures also:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="margin:auto;"
|-
|  style="width:50%; background:#f6f6f6;"|
''Animals stand in a silent waiting pose. Sheep were carved especially roughly. These are almost stone bars, standing on two pedestals. Sometimes only head with hardly carved horns, which do not go beyond the flatness of temple, is carved by incisor. Lines of back and croup are given clearly. But legs are only drown and are not apart from the body, looking like a whole stone.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''The Cactaceae''''' is a monograph on plants of the cactus family written by the American botanists [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] and [[Joseph Nelson Rose]] and published in multiple volumes between 1919 and 1923. It was landmark study that extensively reorganized cactus taxonomy and is still considered a cornerstone of the field.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt; It was illustrated with drawings and color plates principally by the British botanical artist [[Mary Emily Eaton]] as well as with black-and-white photographs.

==History==
[[File:Britton Rose Cactaceae v1-plate34.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of several  ''Opuntia'' cactus species by Mary Emily Eaton for Britton and Rose's ''The Cactaceae'', 1919 (vol. 1, plate XXXIV).]]

Nathaniel Lord Britton was a Columbia University geology and biology professor who left the university in 1895 to become the founding director of the [[New York Botanical Garden]]. Much of his own field work was done in the Caribbean. Joseph Nelson Rose was an authority on several plant families, including parsley ([[Apiaceae]]) and cacti ([[Cactaceae]]). He had been a plant curator at the Smithsonian since 1896, and while working there he made several field trips to Mexico, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian and for Britton's newly founded New York Botanical Garden. Together, Britton and Rose published many articles on the stonecrop family ([[Crassulaceae]]) before embarking in 1904 on research leading towards ''The Cactaceae''. With the support of Douglas T. MacDougal, director of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]]'s Desert Botanical Laboratory, the Carnegie Institution agreed to fund the project.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Rose took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to pursue it, and both Rose and Britton were named Carnegie Institution Research Associates in 1912, when more focused work on the project began.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Between 1912 and 1916 Rose and Britton did extensive field work, collecting specimens and touring the botanical gardens and notable collections of Europe, the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;

In this period, cactus taxonomy was in a disorganized state with only a few very large and heterogeneous genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; Britton and Rose broke these old-style catch-all genera into smaller, more defined genera, ultimately classifying 1255 species under 124 genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; It has been argued that with this first major overhaul of cactus genera, they ushered in an era of 'splitting' or liberalism in cactus taxonomy, in contrast to the conservative 'lumping' approach that characterized their predecessors.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

Britton and Rose defined their genera by the characteristics of the cactus plants' vegetation, flowers, and fruit, as well as by their geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; They drew on their own and others' field work, as well as on greenhouse studies and specimens in [[herbarium|herbaria]] to describe species included in their exhaustive study.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; An important aspect of their work was their careful reexamination of existing type specimens, many of which turned out to have been incorrectly identified.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

Britton and Rose published ''The Cactaceae'' in four volumes through the Carnegie Institution between 1919 and 1923. It "set new standards in cactus botany"&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; and has been called Britton's "magnum opus".&lt;ref name=nybg/&gt; Though it was considered definitive in its own day,&lt;ref name=amre/&gt; the taxonomy of Cactaceae has remained problematic, due in part to difficulties in preserving type specimens of cactus. Several taxonomic reorganizations have succeeded Britton and Rose's work, with the most recent major one dating to 1984. (See [[Cactus#Taxonomy and classification|Cactus]] entry for more details.) Despite this, the excellence of their work is reflected in the fact that some 50 of the 79 genera they authored are still considered phylogenetically sound, though some have been redefined.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

A black-and-white reprint of the second (1937) edition of ''The Cactaceae'' was published by Dover Publications in 1963. In 2006, Daniel Schweich undertook a project to digitize the entire book, and all four volumes can now be downloaded in full color.

In 1911, the British illustrator [[Mary Emily Eaton]] moved to New York, where she was employed by the New York Botanical Garden for two decades. The great majority of color plates in the four volumes of  ''The Cactaceae''  are by Eaton, with a handful by other artists such as [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], H.A. Wood, and Kako Morita.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=hartwell/&gt; Eaton's compositions are striking and her watercolors are noted for their crispness and accuracy of botanical detail. 

The color plates are supplemented by black-and-white line drawings as well as by black-and-white photographs of cacti, ranging from long shots taken in the field to close-up details.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; One contemporary reviewer called ''The Cactaceae'' “the most sumptuous botanical publication" since [[William Rickatson Dykes]]’ 1913 book ''The Genus Iris''.&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

'''The Firm''' is a film and television production and talent management company based in [[Santa Monica]], California.  Established in 1997, it ceased operations in November 2008 and was relaunched by its founder, [[Jeff Kwatinetz]], in August 2015. The Firm's divisions also include a record label and a marketing group.&lt;ref name="deadline relaunch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreva|first1=Nellie|title=Jeff Kwatinetz To Relaunch The Firm Management &amp; Production Company|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/jeff-kwatinetz-the-firm-relaunched-1201494743/|accessdate=9 September 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|title=Jeff Kwatinetz resigns from the Firm|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/jeff-kwatinetz-resigns-from-the-firm-1117995427/|accessdate=9 September 2015|publisher=Variety|date=November 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Firm was founded by managers [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] and [[Michael Green (agent)|Michael Green]] in 1997.  Operating originally out of Kwatinetz' Malibu apartment, the company was described by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as "racing through the music industry with the velocity of a bullet train"  and by 2000 represented a stable of actors and musicians that had generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenue.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2002"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boucher, Geoff and|first1=Brown, Corrie|title=Hollywood Sizing Up Firm's Grasp|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/07/business/fi-firm7|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwatinetz partnered with David Baram and Rick Yorn to help run the operation later bringing on new talent including [[Criss Angel]] and [[Denzel Washington]].

In 2002 The Firm purchased [[Michael Ovitz]]'s Artist Management Group (AMG) and in 2004 it merged with entertainment consulting company Integrated Entertainment Partners (IEP), led by Rich Frank, a former president of [[Disney]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holson | first = Laura | last2 = Weinraub | first2 = Bernard | title = Some See a Young Ovitz in Emerging Power Broker | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 13, 2002 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/13/business/some-see-a-young-ovitz-in-emerging-power-broker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Waxman | first = Sharon | title = Leading Hollywood Talent and Marketing Companies Merge | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 19, 2004 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D81331F93AA25750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leeds | first = Jeff | last2 = Ulmer | first2 = James | title = Departures Cool Off Agency's Hot Start | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 11, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/movies/11firm.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;   During its first incarnation, the company represented [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Korn]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[DC Pierson]], among others.  In addition to the individual successes of their clients, the company was noted for its prescience in melding celebrities with consumer brands and for its role as an architect of the $2.6 billion  acquisition of Warner Music by a private equity consortium.&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Brooks|title=Rebirth for Soap Operas, and a Career|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/business/media/using-soap-operas-jeff-kwatinetz-plans-an-online-tv-network.html|accessdate=12 September 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Firm ceased operations in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Prospect Park==
{{Main|Prospect Park (production company)}}
Several months after the Firm was closed, Kwatinetz and Frank founded [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]], an entertainment company which replicated the scope of The Firm.&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billboard Staff|title=Jeff Kwatinetz Revives the Firm|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6656725/jeff-kwatinetz-revives-the-firm|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Financed through Kwatinetz' personal assets, Prospect Park focused on TV and film development and production, and included an artist management division and a record company. In 2013 it launched the short-lived [[The Online Network|Online Network]] with the soap operas ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and  ''[[All My Children]]''.&lt;ref name="Variety JK leaves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT TOLN" /&gt;{{r|Billboard}} The company shut down both shows in 2013 as it filed a lawsuit against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], from whom they had licensed the rights to both series.&lt;ref name="Cancellation 2013 (TVG)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/All-My-Children-Canceled-1073248.aspx|title=All My Children Dead (Again), Cast Members Say|last=Stanhope|first=Kate|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 11, 2013|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancellation 2013 (HP)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/12/all-my-children-canceled_n_4259562.html|title='All My Children' Canceled: Online Soap Not Returning|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=November 12, 2013|date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospect Park declared bankruptcy in 2014 pending an outcome on the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="PP Bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Soap opera producer Prospect Park files for bankruptcy protection|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/10/entertainment/la-et-ct-soap-opera-producer-prospect-park-bankruptcy-20140310|first=Meg|last=James|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactivation==
In August 2015 it was announced that the Firm had been reactivated, a decision which Kwatinetz said was based on feedback from the creative community. Prospect Park senior executives Jeremy Summers, [[Angelica Cob-Baehler]] and Josh Barry transitioned to The Firm, and [[Robbie Brenner]], formerly the president of production at [[Relativity Media]], was named president of The Firm's film division shortly after the company relaunched.&lt;ref name=DeadlineBrenner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming, Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Robbie Brenner Leaving Relativity To Run The Firm’s Film Division|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/robbie-brenner-the-firm-relativity-1201517970/|accessdate=11 September 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the banner of Prospect Park Productions, the Firm produces the television series ''[[Salem (TV series)|Salem]]'' for [[WGN America]] and [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Royal Pains]]''; as of 2015, ''Salem'' was in its third season and ''Royal Pains'' in its eighth. As of 2015, the company had projects in development for broadcast, cable and digital platforms which included ''Black Heart'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],  ''Talent'' for [[NBC]], ''Tough Love'' for [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], ''Hard Foul'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]],  '' A Midsummer’s Nightmare'' ([[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]), ''Relics'' ([[Sony Pictures Television|Sony International Networks]]), and a [[Christina Aguilera]] co-produced [[ABC Family]] program tentatively titled ''Hearts and Clubs''. Prospect Park produced FX's ''[[Wilfred (U.S. TV series)|Wilfred]]'', which ran from 2011 through 2014.&lt;ref name="deadline relaunch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talent Deadline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=‘Talent’ Drama With Music Elements From Shaun Cassidy &amp; The Firm Set Up At NBC|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/talent-drama-music-shaun-cassidy-nbc-1201503450/|accessdate=11 September 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Firm manages [[Ice Cube]]'s production company, Cube Vision.  Cube Vision produced ''[[Straight Outta Compton (2015 film)|Straight Outta Compton]]'', as well as the ''[[Friday (film series)|Friday]]'', ''[[Barbershop (film series)|Barbershop]]'' and the ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]'' film franchises.  It has two films in development: ''Humbug'' and ''Rocky Mountain High''.  Kwatinetz has managed  Ice Cube since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming, Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Ice Cube Pitch ‘Rocky Mountain High’ To Universal After 5-Studio Bidding Battle|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/ice-cube-movie-rocky-mountain-high-studio-bidding-battle-844431/|accessdate=25 September 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oscar|title=Ice Cube to star in Humbug, a Christmas Carol update|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/16/ice-cube-humbug-christmas-movie|accessdate=25 September 2015|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Ice Cube, the Firm manages [[P.O.D.]], and [[Dead Sara]], among others. It operates Prospect Park Records, which has released records by artists including [[Azealia Banks]], [[Korn]], [[You Me at Six]], and [[Five Finger Death Punch]], who hit #1 on the album sales charts sales with their 2015 release ''[[Got Your Six]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospect Park Discography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/prospect-park-mn0001092596/credits|website=AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Phil|title=How Five Finger Death Punch Got Huge|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1831201/how-five-finger-death-punch-got-huge-by-writing-songs-for-soldiers/franchises/essay/|website=Stereogum|publisher=Stereogum|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also developing non-basketball-related revenue and marketing opportunies for the [[National Basketball Players Association]].&lt;ref name="DeadlineBrenner"/&gt;

'''The Kipling Society''' is a [[literary society]] open to everyone interested in the work and life of British author [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865-1936). The Kipling Society focuses on Kipling and his place in English Literature, and as such attracts members from all over the world, both general readers and academic researchers.  

The Society’s activities include: regular meetings in the UK, a programme of lectures in London, and a formal Annual Luncheon with a distinguished guest speaker, as well as conferences. The Society publishes ''The Kipling Journal'' quarterly,  and hosts a comprehensive website, which includes a Readers’ Guide to Kipling’s works.  In addition, it runs an essay writing competition for schools, answers enquiries from the public (schools, publishers and writers), and works with the media. In 2014 it contributed to programmes commemorating the centenary of the [[First World War]]. The Society is a Registered Charity (No. 278885) and its activities are managed by a Council and run by the Secretary and honorary officers: The Hon. Secretary, John Lambert; Chair, Mary Hamer; Deputy Chair, John Radcliffe; President, Roger Ayers; Librarian, John Walker; Journal Editor, Janet Montefiore. 
 
==History and Aims==
Founded in 1927 while Kipling was still alive, the society is one of the oldest and most enduring literary societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Literary Societies|url=http://www.allianceofliterarysocieties.org.uk/id11.html|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kipling Society was founded by J H C Brooking and a few fellow enthusiasts, including Kipling's school-friends Major General L C Dunsterville and G C Beresford, who featured in ''Stalky &amp; Co.'' as "Stalky" and "M'Turk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrington|first1=Charles|title=Rudyard Kipling: His Life and Work|date=1986 |origyear=1955|publisher=Penguin|location=London|pages=58, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aims are to promote interest in the works, life and times of Rudyard Kipling and to act as a physical and virtual meeting place for all those interested in him; to make the archive of existing knowledge accessible through its library and website; to foster new research and to support scholarly editions of previously unpublished work.

==Membership and Meetings==
Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the life and works of Rudyard Kipling. Members receive a copy of the quarterly Kipling Journal, and have access to the Society’s regular meetings, and to the Members’ pages of the Society’s web-site. The Society holds five meetings a year in central London, providing lectures and discussions on a range of Kipling-related topics. Meetings and seminars are also held in other parts of Britain from time to time.

==''The Kipling Journal''==
''The Kipling Journal'' is sent quarterly to all members of the Kipling Society and from January 2015 is peer-reviewed.{{cn|date=May 2015}} It includes articles, membership news, Society events, and the texts of talks given by invited speakers. Every issue of the journal is available online via the website except articles published within two years of the current date. 

==Conferences==
The Society organises conferences in partnership with academic institutions. These have attracted international scholars and been significant in developing thinking about Kipling’s work.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

''Kipling in America, 1892-1896'' was held at Marlboro College, Vermont, on October 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/10/07/vermont-hosts-kipling-society-meeting-outside-united-kingdom/gt0gC9nipwx26lcQcdEYQL/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symposium on Kipling's four years in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] after his marriage to the American Caroline Balestier, focused on the influence of Kipling’s time in America on his work.
 
''Rudyard Kipling: an international writer'' was hosted by the [[Institute of English Studies]] at [[University of London]] in October 2011. This coincided with the launch of ''The Cambridge Companion to Kipling'' and many of its contributors were also speakers.
 
''The Kent Conference'' was held at the [[University of Kent]] in September 2007. The conference was organised to mark the centenary of Kipling's Nobel Prize for Literature. It was directed by Dr Jan Montefiore and sponsored by the Kipling Society.

''Post-Colonial Kipling'' was held at [[Magdalene College]], [[Cambridge University]] in September 2001, a century after the publication of ''Kim''. There were four major themes, Kipling: a post-colonial assessment, Kipling and women, Kipling and film, and Kipling in translation.

==The Kipling Library==
The Society maintains a research library of over 1,300 items which can be consulted by members. Kipling’s works were published in a variety of different editions during his lifetime and many of these are owned by the library. It holds a complete set of the Sussex Edition, the most complete single collection of Kipling’s works, which he edited before his death in 1936, and the Cambridge Edition of his verse, the most comprehensive collection of his poetry, edited by Thomas Pinney and published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinney (ed.)|first1=Thomas|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Poems of Rudyard Kipling, 3 Volumes|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library contains biographies, collections of press cuttings, photographs and relevant memorabilia, critical studies and a growing set of translations of Kipling’s works in other languages.  Until June 2014, the Library was housed at City University, London. Most of the collection is now at [[Haileybury College]], Kipling’s old school, with some items being held at [[Sussex University]].

==The Society’s Website==
The Society’s website is a source of information about Kipling’s life and works, including a number of his short stories and articles not published elsewhere. In addition, it offers a range of research tools, guides and back-issues of The Kipling Journal. The website also includes the Readers' Guide, providing introductions and notes to accompany each story, article, and poem. 
 
==The John Slater Memorial Kipling Essay Prize==
The John Slater Memorial Kipling Essay Prize is awarded annually for the winning essay by a Sixth Form student, on selected works by Rudyard Kipling. The prize is £750 (£250 for the student and £500 for the school or college).

==The Rudyard Kipling Mailbase==
A Rudyard Kipling discussion forum enables any member of the 'Rudyard-Kipling' mailbase to exchange messages by email with everyone else on the list globally.

==Bateman’s==
[[Bateman's]] was Rudyard Kipling's House at Burwash in Sussex for over thirty years. It is now a National Trust property and there are close connections with the Kipling Society and a Bateman’s liaison officer keeps members informed of events and developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27091">A '''toupée''' ({{IPAc-en|t|uː|ˈ|p|eɪ}} {{respell|too|PAY|'}}) is a [[Fake hair|hairpiece]] or partial [[Wig (hair)|wig]] of natural or [[synthetic fibre|synthetic hair]] worn to cover partial [[baldness]] or for theatrical purposes. While toupées and hairpieces are typically associated with male wearers, some women also use hairpieces to lengthen existing hair, or cover a partially exposed scalp. The desire to wear hairpieces is caused in part by a long-standing bias against balding that crosses cultures, dating to at least 3100 BC.  Toupée manufacturers' financial results indicate that toupée use is in overall decline, due in part to alternative methods for dealing with baldness, and to greater cultural acceptance of the condition.

== Toupées and wigs ==
While most toupées are small and designed to cover bald spots at the top and back of the head, large toupées are not unknown.

Toupées are often referred to as hairpieces, units, or hair systems.  Many women now wear hairpieces rather than full wigs if their hair loss is confined to the top and crown of their heads.

==Etymology==

According to various sources referenced by Dictionary.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/toupee|title=the definition of toupee|website=www.dictionary.com|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; toupée is related to the French words "top," or "tuft;" tuft as the curl or lock of hair at the top of the head, not necessarily relating to covering baldness. Toupée is related to the diminutive ''toupe'' more recently (as of the 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;"toupee." Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. 13 Aug. 2007. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toupee&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"toupee." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 13 Aug. 2007. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toupee&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Gaius Julius Caesar.jpg|thumb|An engraving of [[Julius Caesar]] showing both pattern baldness and signature wreath, which he used to cover his scalp.&lt;ref name="Looking Good 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyYPLfwNy48C|title=Looking Good: Male Body Image in Modern America|first=Lynne|last=Luciano|date=9 January 2002|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=13 June 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While wigs have a very long and somewhat traceable history, the origin of the "toupée" is more difficult to define, but one can reasonably infer that the first toupée was a piece of hair, worn on the head, with the intention of deceiving the viewer into believing the hair was natural, rather than a wig worn for decorative or ceremonial purposes.

===Use and attitudes in ancient history===
The desire for men to wear hairpieces is a response to a long-standing cultural bias against balding men that crosses cultures.  Between 1 BC and AD 1, the Roman poet [[Ovid]] wrote [[Ars Amatoria]] ("The Art of Love") in which he expressed "Ugly are hornless bulls, a field without grass is an eyesore, So is a tree without leaves, so is a head without hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ovid/lboo/|title=The Love Books of Ovid Index|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this bias, in a later and different culture, can be found in ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' (c. AD 800-900), in which the female character [[Scheherazade]] asks "Is there anything more ugly in the world than a man beardless and bald as an [[artichoke]]?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/luciano-looking.html Book Review of ''Looking Good''], author?, ''New York Times'', date? (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known example of a toupée was found in a tomb&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Near East'', Amelie Kuhrt, [[Routledge]], September 1995, ISBN ?&lt;/ref&gt; near the ancient [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] capital of Egypt, [[Hierakonpolis]]. The tomb and its contents date to (''ca.'' [[3200 BC|3200]] &amp;ndash; [[3100 BC]].)

At least two ancient Greek statues of men wearing toupées survive today, one identified as a [[Capitoline]] type, presently located in [[Thorvaldsens Museum]] in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Greek Portrait Sculpture: Contexts, Subjects, and Styles'', Sheila Dillon, Cambridge University Press, 2006 ISBN ?&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] is known to have worn a toupée. In dismay at his pattern baldness, he tried both wearing a toupée, and shaving his head.&lt;ref&gt;"Change and Permanence in Men's Clothes", A. Hyatt Mayor, ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] Bulletin'', New Series, Vol. 8, No. 9 (May, 1950), pp. 262-269 {{doi|10.2307/3257422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state that he wore his trademark ceremonial wreath to disguise his shrinking hairline.&lt;ref name="Looking Good 2002" /&gt; Roman men of the era were also known to paint their bald heads to appear to have locks of hair.&lt;ref name="Looking Good 2002" /&gt;

===19th century===
In the United States, toupée use (as opposed to wigs) grew in the 19th century. One researcher has noted that this is in part due to a shift in perceptions over the perceived value of aging that occurred at that time.  Men chose to attempt to appear younger, and toupées were one method used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...since 1800, the U.S. Census generally shows far more 39-year-olds than 40-year-olds. Furthermore, the costume of men switched from a design clearly intended to make the young look older to one that was clearly intended to make the old look younger.  For example, this era saw the decline of the wig and the rise of the toupée.&lt;ref&gt;TEXT ANALYSIS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; Edited by CARL W. ROBERTS; Iowa State University; LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOCIATES, PUBLISHERS, 1997 Mahwah, New Jersey, page 19 https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=88053789&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===20th century===
By the 1950s, it was estimated that over 350,000 U.S. men wore hairpieces, out of a potential 15 million wearers.  Toupée manufacturers helped to build credibility for their product starting in 1954, when several makers advertised hairpieces in major magazines and newspapers, with successful results.  Key to the promotion and acceptance of Toupées was improved toupée craftsmanship, pioneered by [[Max Factor]].  Factor's toupées were carefully made and almost invisible, with each strand of hair sewed to a piece of fine flesh-colored lace, and in a variety of long and short hairstyles.  Factor, also a Hollywood makeup innovator, was the supplier of choice for most Hollywood actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823544-2,00.html "Glamour For Sale"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. August 23, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1959, total U.S. sales were estimated by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to be $15 million a year.  [[Sears-Roebuck]], which had sold Toupées as early as 1900 via its mail order catalog, tried to tap into the market by sending out 30,000 special catalogs by [[direct mail]] to a targeted list, advertising "career winning" hair products manufactured by Joseph Fleischer &amp; Co., a respected wig manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892460,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "Proper Toppers"]. ''Time''. March 30, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;  Toupées continued to be advertised in print, likely with heavier [[media buy]]s ([[Advertising media selection]]) taking place in magazines with the appropriate male demographic.  A typical "[[advertorial]]" can be found in [http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/04/10/fastest-way-to-grow-hair/ Modern Mechanix].

By 1970, ''Time'' magazine estimated that in the U.S., toupées were worn by more than 2.5 million men out of 17 - 20 million balding men.  The increase was chalked up once again to further improvements in hairpiece technology, a desire to seem more youthful, and the long hairstyles that were increasingly in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909329,00.html "Rugs and Plugs"]. ''Time''. June 10, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
Toupée and wig manufacture is no longer centered in the U.S., but in Asia.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aderans, based in Japan, is one of the world’s largest wigmakers, with 35% share of the Japanese domestic market.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

From 2002 to 2004, new orders from Aderans's male customers (both domestic and international) slipped by 30%.  Researchers at both the Daiwa Institute and Nomura Research – two key Japanese economic research institutes – conclude that there is "no sign of a recovery" for the toupée industry.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;  Sales for male wearers have continued to fall at Aderans in every year since, aside from 2016 where they increased slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aderan Sales Figures.|url=https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/financials?s=ADRNF:PNK&amp;mhq5j=e1|publisher=Aderans Co Ltd.|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers confirm the media consensus&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; that toupée use is in decline overall.  No reliable sources have stated numbers for the estimated population of toupée users in the U.S. or internationally, so comparisons to past eras are difficult to make with any accuracy.  Regardless, hairpiece manufacturers and retailers continue to market their goods in print, on television, and on the internet.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Manufacture==

Toupées are often custom made to the needs of the wearer, and can be manufactured using either synthetic or human hair.  Toupées are usually held to one's head using an adhesive, but the cheaper versions often merely use an elastic band.

Toupée manufacture is often done at the local level by a craftsman, but large wig manufacturers also produce toupées.  Both individuals and large firms have constantly innovated to produce better quality toupées and toupée material, with over 60 patents for toupées.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=toupee&amp;FIELD1=&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=&amp;FIELD2=&amp;d=PALL|title=Patent Database Search Results: toupee in US Patent Collection|website=patft.uspto.gov|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 260 for hairpieces &lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=hairpiece&amp;FIELD1=&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=&amp;FIELD2=&amp;d=PALL|title=Patent Database Search Results: hairpiece in US Patent Collection|website=patft.uspto.gov|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed at the [[U.S. Patent Office]] since 1790.

The first patent for a toupée was filed in 1921, and the first patent for a "hairpiece" was filed in 1956.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;

===Hair weaves===

[[Hair weave]]s are a technique in which the toupée's base is then woven into whatever natural hair the wearer retains.  While this may result in a less detectable toupée, the wearer can experience discomfort, and sometimes hair loss from frequently retightening of the weave as one's own hair grows.  After about six months a person can begin to lose hair permanently along the weave area, resulting in [[traction alopecia]].  Hair weaves were very popular in the 1980s &amp; 1990s, but are not usually recommended because of the potential for permanent hair damage and hair loss.

==Use and maintenance==
While toupée dealers attempt to match the toupée's color to the natural hair color of the wearer, sometimes the colors are not identical.  This color mismatch is often exacerbated when a toupée is poorly cared for and fades, or the wearer's hair color turns gray while the toupée retains its original color. However a good salon will take this into account and will have the expertise to handle any problems.  New technology has allowed hair manufacturers to mimic human hair, overcoming many of the weaknesses of human hair.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

While toupée dealers and manufacturers usually advertise their products showing men swimming, water-skiing and enjoying watersports, these activities can often cause irreversible wear to the toupée.  Saltwater and chlorine can cause a toupée to "wear out" quickly. Many shampoos and soaps will damage toupée fibers, which unlike natural hair, cannot grow back or replace themselves.

While dealers of toupées can in fact help many customers to care for their toupées and make their presence virtually undetectable, the hairpieces must be of very high quality to begin with, carefully fitted, and maintained regularly and carefully.  Even the best-cared-for toupée will need to be replaced on a regular basis, due to wear and, over time, to the growing areas of baldness on the wearer's head and changes in the shade of remaining hair.  Some recommend that if one chooses to use a toupée, three should be owned at any one time - one to wear while its counterpart is being cleaned, and a spare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Toupee Went Out of Fashion|url=http://baldinglife.com/why-the-toupee-went-out-of-fashion/|website=baldinglife.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Men typically wear toupées after resorting to less extreme methods of coverage.  The first tactic is to make remaining hair appear thick and widespread through a [[combover]].  Other alternatives include non-surgical hair replacement, which consists of a very thin hairpiece which is put on with a medical adhesive and worn for weeks at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hairreplacement-london.co.uk/how-hair-replacement-works/|title=How Hair Replacement Systems Work - Infographic|date=8 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications and medical procedures===

[[Propecia]], [[Minoxidil|Rogaine]] and other pharmaceutical remedies were approved for treatment of [[Androgenetic alopecia|Alopecia]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in the 1990s.  These have proven capable of regrowing or sustaining existing hair at least part of the time.

However, [[hair transplantation]], which guarantees at least some immediate results, has often replaced the use of toupées among those who can afford them, particularly onscreen celebrities.

===Baldness as fashion, acceptance of hair loss===
Other trends leading to the decline in toupée use include a rise in acceptance of baldness by those men afflicted with it. Short haircuts, in fashion since the 1990s, have tended to minimize the appearance of baldness, and many balding men choose to shave their heads entirely.

==Chemotherapy and injury==

An important exception to the typical reasons for wearing a toupée is that recovering [[chemotherapy]] patients sometimes wear toupées. This type of hairpiece is technically referred to as a [[hair prosthesis]].  A positive self-image has often been said to assist in the recovery process, and doctors often help direct recovering patients to find hairpieces to help project their usual healthy appearance.  This effort is particularly made when the recovering patient is a child, or a woman.

Another exception is that if a person's head has been damaged by an accident, or through a surgical procedure, the victim or patient may wish to conceal scarring.  [[Steven Van Zandt]] of the [[E Street Band]] wore a toupée in his role on ''[[The Sopranos]]'' to cover scarring he had received after a car accident several years prior.  While performing onstage, and in his personal life, Van Zandt favors a [[bandanna]].

There are at least four charities that specialize in providing hairpieces for children that have lost hair due to Chemotherapy, medical treatment or head injury:
*[http://www.locksoflove.org/ Locks of Love - A charitable organization for children who have lost their hair after medical treatment]
*[http://www.wigsforkids.org/ Wigs for Kids - A charitable organization for children who have lost hair due to chemotherapy]
*[http://www.tlcdirect.org The American Cancer Society Tender Loving Care Wigs]
*[http://www.hairthatcares.org Hair That Cares, Inc. - A charitable organization for adults and children who have lost their hair after medical treatment and Alopecia ]

==Humor==
Toupées have a long and often humorous history in Western culture.  The toupée is a regular butt of jokes in many media, with a typical toupée joke focusing on the wearer's inability to recognize how ineffective the toupée is in concealing his baldness.  An early instance of "toupée humor" was an illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] in "The Comic Almanack" in 1837, in which he drew the effect of a strong wind, with a man's toupée whipped from his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5008235226|title=Cruikshank, Thackeray and the Victorian Eclipse of Satire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208081147/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5008235226|archive-date=8 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, toupées were a source of humor in virtually all forms of media, including cartoons, films, radio and television.  In the 21st century, toupées continue to be a source for humor, with a variety of [[internet]] sites devoted to toupées, with a special emphasis on suspected celebrity hairpiece wearers.

[[Thaddeus Stevens]], famed 19th century U.S. Congressman and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], was known for his humor and wit. On one occasion while in the Capitol, a woman requested a lock of his hair (collecting locks of hair was common at this time).  Since he was bald and wearing a toupée, he ripped it off and gave it to her.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, Hans L. Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Known wearers ==

Film and television stars of both past and present often wear toupées for professional reasons, particularly as they begin to age and need to maintain the image their fans have become accustomed to. However, many of these same celebrities go "uncovered" when not working or making public appearances.
&lt;!-- This list is presented for illustrative purposes, to show the prevalence of toupée use throughout history: it is not intended to mock the wearers. Due to sensitivities regarding the living, only deceased, publicly known (and often, self-admitted) toupée wearers, are listed here. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">In [[information visualization]] and [[graphic design]], '''Truchet tiles''' are square tiles decorated with patterns that are not [[rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetric]]. When placed within a [[square tiling]] of the plane, they can form varied patterns, and the orientation of each tile can be used to visualize information associated with the tile's position within the tiling.&lt;ref name="browne08"&gt;{{citation

Truchet tiles were first described in a 1704 memoir by [[Sébastien Truchet]] entitled "Mémoire sur les combinaisons", and were popularized in 1987 by [[Cyril Stanley Smith]].&lt;ref name="browne08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 373–385
 | title = The tiling patterns of Sebastian Truchet and the topology of structural hierarchy
 | volume = 20
 | year = 1987}}. With a translation of Truchet's text by Pauline Boucher.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
===Contrasting triangles===
The tile originally studied by Truchet is split along the diagonal into two triangles of contrasting colors. The tile has four possible orientations.

[[File:Truchet base tiles bordered.png|center]]

Some examples of surface filling made tiling such a [[pattern]].

With a scheme:
[[File:Truchet ordered tiling.svg|center]]

With random placement:
[[File:Truchet base tiling.svg|center|thumb|250px]]

===Quarter-circles===
A second common form of the Truchet tiles, due to {{harvtxt|Smith|1987}}, decorates each tile with two quarter-circles connecting the midpoints of adjacent sides. Each such tile has two possible orientations.

{{multiple image
| align     = center
| footer    = 
| width     = 120
| image1    = Truchet tile.svg
| alt1      = Truchet tile
| caption1  = The Truchet tile
| image2    = Truchet tile inverse.svg
| alt2      = Truchet tile inverse
| caption2  = Inverse of the Truchet tile, created by any 90° rotation or orthogonal flip
}}

We have such a tiling:

[[File:Truchet tiling.svg|thumb|center|250px]]

This type of tile has also been used in abstract strategy games [[Trax (game)|Trax]] and the [[Black Path Game]], prior to Smith's work.&lt;ref name="browne08"/&gt;

===Diagonal===
A [[labyrinth]] can be generated by tiles in the form of a white square with a black diagonal. As with the quarter-circle tiles, each such tile has two orientations.&lt;ref name="goto"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://news.mit.edu/2013/10-print-chr2055rnd1-goto-10 | title=10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 | publisher=MIT Press | author=Montfort, Nick | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The connectivity of the resulting labyrinth can be analyzed mathematically using [[percolation theory]] as bond percolation at the critical point of a diagonally-oriented grid.
[[Nick Montfort]] considers the single line of [[Commodore 64]] [[BASIC]] required to generate such patterns - &lt;code&gt;10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10&lt;/code&gt; - to be "a [[concrete poetry|concrete poem]], a found poem".&lt;ref name="goto"/&gt;

When his grandson asks which wolf wins, the grandfather answers whichever he chooses to feed.

== In media ==
The story is frequently quoted in various forms in media articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salisburypost.com/2015/12/14/which-wolf-are-you-feeding/|title=Which wolf are you feeding? - Salisbury Post|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/19715884-113/a-message-of-hope |title=Editorial: A message of hope |publisher=PostIndependent.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kali-hawlk/do-you-feed-the-good-wolf_b_8048124.html |title=Do You Feed the Good Wolf or the Bad? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a podcast called [http://oneyoufeed.net The One You Feed,]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneyoufeed.net/ |title=A podcast about feeding your good wolf |publisher=The One You Feed |date=2013-09-15 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was summarized in the 2015 film ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Author Interviews |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/22/408459870/the-future-is-bright-in-the-time-and-space-twisting-tomorrowland |title=The Future Is Bright In The Time-And-Space Twisting 'Tomorrowland' |publisher=NPR |date=2015-05-22 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://clearlens.org/2015/05/26/tomorrowland-feeding-the-right-wolf/ |title=Tomorrowland: Feeding the Right Wolf – A Clear Lens |publisher=Clearlens.org |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Wikiquote]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tomorrowland_%28film%29 |title=Tomorrowland (film) - Wikiquote |publisher=En.wikiquote.org |date=2016-01-24 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Casey Newton''': "There are two [[wolves]]" … You told me this story my entire life, and now I'm telling you: There are two [[wolves]] and they are always [[fighting]]. One is [[darkness]] and [[despair]], the other is [[light]] and [[hope]]. Which wolf wins?
:'''Eddie Newton''': C'mon, Casey.
:'''Casey Newton''': Okay, fine, don’t answer.
:'''Eddie Newton''': Whichever one you feed.
:'''Casey Newton''': Good. Eat.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In the [[Luke Cage (TV Series)]] Season 2, Episode 2, at time-index 48:06, a pastor tells the story of a "Cherokee Legend", with the metaphor of two wolves fighting, where the boy in the story asks "Which wolf is stronger?" and his grandfather responds: "It's the one you feed."

=== Likely references ===
The names and phrases from the following are likely referring to this legend:
* [[Wolves Within]] (album name)
* [[The Fallout (Crown the Empire album)]], specifically name of track 5. "The One You Feed"
* [[Kirov Academy of Ballet]], specifically “The One I Feed”, a charity event
* The 11th episode of [[Star Trek: Discovery]] is titled "The Wolf Inside", and in part is about an inner struggle.
* "Feed The Wolf", the second song on Breaking Benjamin's 2018 album, [[Ember_(album)|Ember]].

== Possible Variants ==
There is a story told by the Reverend Billy Graham in his book ''The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life'' (W Publishing Group 1978) about an Eskimo with a black dog and a white dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Billy |date=1978 |title=''The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life'' |url= |location= |publisher=W Publishing Group |page=92 |isbn=978-0849900051 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be a variant of, or similar in some respects to, the Two Wolves.

The '''United Paramount Network''' ('''UPN''') was an American [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]] that launched on January 16, 1995. The network was originally owned by [[Chris-Craft Industries]] and [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]]; [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through its [[Paramount Television]] unit, which produced most of the network's series) turned the network into a [[joint venture]] in 1996 after acquiring a 50% stake in the network, and subsequently purchased Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. In December 2005, UPN was spun off to [[CBS Corporation]] when Viacom split into two separate companies.

CBS Corporation and [[Time Warner]] jointly announced on January 24, 2006 that the companies would shut down UPN and competitor [[The WB]] to launch a new joint venture network later that year.&lt;ref name="UPN, WB merge"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN, WB to Merge Into CW Network|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|last=Crupi|first=Anthony|work=[[AdWeek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 24, 2006|accessdate=February 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064454/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN ceased broadcasting on September 15, 2006, with The WB following suit two days later.

==History==
===1949–1993: Origins of network===
[[Paramount Pictures]] had played a pivotal role in the development of network television. It was a partner in the [[DuMont Television Network]], and the Paramount Theaters chain, which was spun off from the corporate/studio parent, merged with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in a deal that helped cement that network's status as a major network. The [[Paramount Television Network]] was launched in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=82NT1nDUQ1oC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=paramount+Television+network+in+1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F2lqiHAwVW&amp;sig=bjSI1AONysTEHk5o8ThRUeVxzMA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjugumc4KfWAhVK4oMKHUSrBLc4ChDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramount%20Television%20network%20in%201949&amp;f=false|title=Superstations|publisher=PediaPress|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916052935/https://books.google.tn/books?id=82NT1nDUQ1oC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=paramount+Television+network+in+1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F2lqiHAwVW&amp;sig=bjSI1AONysTEHk5o8ThRUeVxzMA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjugumc4KfWAhVK4oMKHUSrBLc4ChDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramount%20Television%20network%20in%201949&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but dissolved in the 1950s.

In the wake of the successful [[Universal Studios]] ''[[ad hoc]]'' [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package ''[[Operation Prime Time]]'', which first featured a [[miniseries]] adaptation of [[John Jakes]]' novel ''The Bastard'' and went on to air several more productions, Paramount had earlier contemplated its own television network with the [[Paramount Television Service]]. Set to launch in early [[1978 in television|1978]], it would have run its programming for only one night a week. Thirty "Movies of the Week" would have followed ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' on Saturday nights. Plans for the new network were scrapped when sufficient advertising slots could not be sold, though Paramount would contribute some programs to ''Operation Prime Time'', such as the mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'', and the weekly pop music program, ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''. ''Star Trek: Phase II'' was reworked as the theatrical film, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', absorbing the costs already incurred from the aborted television series.

Paramount, and its eventual parent [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (which bought the studio's then-parent, Paramount Communications, in 1994), continued to consider launching their own television network. [[Independent station (North America)|Independent station]]s, even more than [[network affiliate]]s, were feeling the growing pressure of audience erosion to [[cable television]] in the 1980s and 1990s; there were unaffiliated commercial [[television station]]s in most of the major television markets, even after the foundation of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1986. Meanwhile, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], which had long been successful in syndication with repeats of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', launched several first-run syndicated series by the 1990s, including ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'', ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.

In 1993, [[Time Warner]] and [[Chris-Craft Industries]] entered into a [[joint venture]] to distribute programs via a [[prime time]] programming service, the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (PTEN). PTEN can be seen as the ancestor of both UPN and [[The WB]]:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Chris-Craft later became a partner in UPN, and Time Warner launched The WB in a joint venture with the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] at roughly the same time.

Paramount formed the [[Paramount Stations Group]] in 1991 when it purchased the assets of the [[TVX Broadcast Group]], which owned several independent stations in major markets. This was not unlike the purchase of the [[Metromedia]] stations by [[News Corporation]] five years earlier, which were used as the nuclei for Fox. In another parallel, [[20th Century Fox]] (the News Corporation subsidiary behind the FOX network, which was spun off with the company's other entertainment assets to [[21st Century Fox]] in July 2013), like Paramount, had long been a powerhouse in television syndication. All indicators suggested that Paramount was about to launch a network of its own.

On October 27, 1993, Paramount and Chris-Craft announced the formation of a new television network, later to be named the '''United Paramount Network''', with initial plans to run two hours of programming in prime time for two nights per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paramount Plans a TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/business/paramount-plans-a-tv-network.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 27, 1993|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094915/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/business/paramount-plans-a-tv-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new network would be owned by [[Chris-Craft Industries]], while most of its shows were to be produced by [[Paramount Television]].

Originally, the network was to simply be called "U", but the "U Network" trademark was held by the now-defunct [[National Association of College Broadcasters]] (NACB), which had been operating a satellite television programming network featuring largely college student-produced programs since 1991. The founder and first head of UPN, [[Lucie Salhany]], approached NACB with an offer of US$50,000 to transfer the name. Due to the costs related to rebranding the student network, and under the advice of its then-volunteer legal counsel, Mr. Cary Tepper, the non-profit association countered with a request of $100,000, which Ms. Salhany refused. Ultimately, the "U" in UPN stood for Chris-Craft subsidiary [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]], which owned the network's two largest stations, [[WWOR-TV]] in [[New York City]] and [[KCOP-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]; the "P" represented Paramount Television, the studio that formed a programming partnership with Chris-Craft to create the network. Chris-Craft and Paramount/Viacom each owned independent stations in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities, and these stations formed the nuclei of the new network.

UPN launched on January 16, 1995, initially carrying programming only on Monday and Tuesday nights from 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 2 Would-Be Networks Get Set for Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 9, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094720/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first telecast, the [[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|two-hour pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', was an auspiciously widely viewed start – being watched by 21.3 million viewers; however, ''Voyager'' would never achieve such viewership levels again, nor would any of the series debuting on UPN's second night of broadcasting survive the season. In contrast, The WB debuted one week earlier, on January 11, with four series – only one of which, ''[[Muscle (TV series)|Muscle]]'', would not survive its first season. The first comedy series to debut on UPN were ''[[Platypus Man]]'', starring [[Richard Jeni]], and ''[[Pig Sty]]'', with both shows airing Monday nights in the 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour; both received mixed reviews, and neither lasted long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN Network Cancels 3 of Its 4 Programs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/arts/upn-network-cancels-3-of-its-4-programs.html|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094847/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/arts/upn-network-cancels-3-of-its-4-programs.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early UPN programs included the action series ''[[Nowhere Man (TV series)|Nowhere Man]]'', starring [[Bruce Greenwood]] and ''[[Marker (TV series)|Marker]]'', starring [[Richard Grieco]]; the comic western ''[[Legend (TV series)|Legend]]'' starring [[Richard Dean Anderson]]; the science-fiction themed action series, ''[[The Sentinel (TV series)|The Sentinel]]''; and ''[[Moesha]]'', a sitcom starring [[Brandy (entertainer)|Brandy Norwood]]. Of the network's early offerings, only ''Star Trek: Voyager'', ''Moesha'' and ''The Sentinel'' would last longer than one season. As a result of the lack of viewership, UPN operated on a loss and had lost $800 million by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Won't Anyone Pull the Plug on UPN?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/04/03/2000_04_03_032_TNY_LIBRY_000020545|author=James Surowiecki|periodical=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=April 3, 2000|accessdate=January 17, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218170110/https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/04/03/2000_04_03_032_TNY_LIBRY_000020545|archivedate=December 18, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nearly two years of the network's launch, on December 8, 1996, Paramount/Viacom purchased a 50% stake in UPN from Chris-Craft for approximately $160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VIACOM BUYS 50 PERCENT STAKE IN UPN NETWORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/05/business/viacom-buys-50-percent-stake-in-upn-network.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 5, 1996|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094516/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/05/business/viacom-buys-50-percent-stake-in-upn-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom to buy half of UPN: is investing $160 million in fledgling network|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18935896.html|author=Steve McClellan|author2=Lynette Rice|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=December 9, 1996|accessdate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011162936/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18935896.html|archivedate=October 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fox had done nine years earlier, UPN started with a few nights of programming each week, with additional nights of primetime shows gradually being added over the course of several seasons. Because of this, UPN's affiliates were basically independent stations for all intents and purposes during the network's early years, with these stations airing either syndicated programs or movies during primetime on nights when the network did not provide programming. The first expansion of its prime time lineup came with the addition of programming on Wednesday nights on March 6, 1996 (during the second half of the 1995–96 season); that expansion also saw UPN assume the broadcast rights to the [[Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]], which aired its inaugural broadcast on CBS the year prior.

UPN ordered 36 science fiction films to air as part of its weekly movie presentations beginning in 1998; the films were supplied by four production companies, with most of the titles coming from Paramount. Some titles would be shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] first, which allowed the [[pay television|premium cable channel]] to cooperate in advertising the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segrave|first1=Kerry|title=Movies at home : how Hollywood came to television|date=1999|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.]|isbn=0786406542|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTehB3M1_kC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 8, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624054459/https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTehB3M1_kC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=June 24, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPN completed its prime time expansion in the 1998–99 season, with Thursdays and Fridays as the last nights of programming to be added to the network's evening slate. That season saw the debut of ''[[The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer]]'', a sitcom set during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that centered on a black English nobleman who becomes the valet to [[Abraham Lincoln]]; even before its debut, the series was riddled by controversy and protests from several African American activist groups (including the Los Angeles chapter of the [[NAACP]], who picketed outside [[Paramount Studios]] one week before the originally scheduled [[television pilot|pilot episode]]) and some advertisers for its perceived lighthearted take on [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery in the 19th century]], protested against the premise of the series. Despite what publicity ''Desmond'' received from its controversial topicality, the series suffered from low ratings (with the first episode on October 5, 1998, placing 116th out of 125 programs aired that week on network television) and was cancelled after four episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism Is Not 'Diary's' Crime|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/02/entertainment/ca-28389|author=Howard Rosenberg|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 2, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094649/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/02/entertainment/ca-28389|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Candy Maker Pulls Its Ads From Controversial Comedy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/business/fi-32006|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 13, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094959/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/business/fi-32006|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=300 Protest at Studio Against TV Comedy Set in Slavery Era|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/01/local/me-28286|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 1, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094615/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/01/local/me-28286|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They Vote by Remote: As UPN debuts 'Desmond Pfeiffer,' viewers tune in other channels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/07/entertainment/ca-29945|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094510/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/07/entertainment/ca-29945|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Desmond Pfeiffer' Is Deep-Sixed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/07/entertainment/ca-40123|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=November 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094549/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/07/entertainment/ca-40123|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999-2005: Viacom era and decline===
[[Image:Paramount networklogo.jpg|225px|thumb|Proposed logo for the stillborn Paramount Network.]]
Six months after the company announced its $36 billion merger with (the original) [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in March 1999, Viacom exercised a contractual clause that would – within a 45-day grace period – force Chris-Craft to either buy Viacom out of UPN, or have the former sell its ownership stake in the network to Viacom. Three days later on February 8, Chris-Craft subsequently filed a lawsuit against Viacom in the [[New York Supreme Court]] to block the latter's merger with CBS, claiming that a pact signed between the two partners in 1997 had prevented either from owning "any interest, financial or otherwise" in "any competing network," including CBS, for a four-year period through January 2001. On March 17, New York Supreme Court judge Herman Cahn ruled against Chris-Craft's move for a permanent [[injunction]] to curtail the Viacom-CBS merger and the enforcement of Viacom's ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viacom Makes 2 Offers to BHC on TV Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/business/viacom-makes-2-offers-to-bhc-on-tv-venture.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 4, 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103205351/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/business/viacom-makes-2-offers-to-bhc-on-tv-venture.html|archivedate=November 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BHC Sues UPN Partner Viacom Over CBS Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/09/business/fi-62554|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=February 9, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095028/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/09/business/fi-62554|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris-Craft Loses UPN Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/business/chris-craft-loses-upn-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 17, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095032/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/business/chris-craft-loses-upn-ruling.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Viacom taking full ownership control of UPN, KCOP-TV and WWOR-TV lost their statuses as O&amp;Os and automatically became affiliates of the network, with the network's largest owned-and-operated station becoming [[Philadelphia]] outlet [[WPSG]] (now the flagship station of [[The CW]]). In addition, neither Chris-Craft or Viacom had ever held ownership of Chicago affiliate [[WPWR-TV]], which had been the largest UPN station that was not owned-and-operated by the network prior to the Viacom buyout.

Shortly afterward, Viacom shortened the network's official name from the "United Paramount Network" to the three-letter initialism, "UPN". Viacom also proposed a rebranding of UPN into the "'''Paramount Network'''", using a prototype logo based on Paramount Pictures' mountain logo, which served as the basis for the "P" triangle in the network's original logo that was used until September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media Talk; UPN Will Become Paramount Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/business/media-talk-upn-will-become-paramount-network.html|author=Jim Rutenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 31, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094613/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/business/media-talk-upn-will-become-paramount-network.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN Network Will Carry On Without Its 'U'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/entertainment/ca-59125|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 26, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094628/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/entertainment/ca-59125|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN's Name in 2001: Paramount Network|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/business/fi-59235|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 26, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095147/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/26/business/fi-59235|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was abandoned after many affiliates protested, citing that the rebranding might confuse viewers and result in ratings declines, along with the costs of rebranding their stations with a new image and new network (and possible call sign changes).

Viacom's purchase of [[CBS]] a few months before (which resulted in the merger of that network's owned-and-operated stations into Viacom's Paramount Stations Group unit), created duopolies between CBS and UPN stations in Philadelphia ([[KYW-TV]] and WPSG), [[Boston]] ([[WBZ-TV]] and [[WSBK-TV]]), [[Miami]] ([[WFOR-TV]] and [[WBFS-TV]]), [[Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]] ([[KTVT]] and [[KTXA]]), [[Detroit]] ([[WWJ-TV]] and [[WKBD-TV]]) and [[Pittsburgh]] ([[KDKA-TV]] and [[WPCW|WNPA]]). Viacom's purchase of CBS was said to be the "death knell" for the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s longtime ban on [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|television station duopolies]]. Further transactions added [[San Francisco]] ([[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBHK]], the latter of which was traded to Viacom/CBS by [[Fox Television Stations]]) and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] ([[KOVR]] and [[KMAX-TV]], the former of which was sold to Viacom/CBS by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]) to the mix.

At the time of UPN's launch, the network's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] was Chris-Craft-owned WWOR-TV in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] (which serves the New York City market). Even after Chris-Craft sold its share in the network to Viacom, WWOR was still commonly regarded as the flagship of the network since it had long been common practice for this status to be associated with a network's New York station. For this reason, some doubt was cast on UPN's future after Fox Television Stations bought most of Chris-Craft's television stations for $5.5 billion on August 12, 2000, which included several UPN affiliates (including WWOR and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] flagship KCOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox in the UPN house|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-upn-house/87627|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=August 21, 2000|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112714/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-upn-house/87627|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox later bought the third-largest UPN affiliate, Chicago's WPWR-TV, through a separate deal with [[Newsweb Corporation]] for $450 million in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox duops in Chicago|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-duops-chicago/93050|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=June 30, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112703/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fox-duops-chicago/93050|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Takeover to Bring Changes to Chicago-Area Television Station|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90412674.html|author=Kathy Bergen|agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the uncertainty of the network's future following the Fox purchases, UPN reached four-year affiliation agreements with Fox Television Stations' nine UPN affiliates on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; NINE FOX-OWNED STATIONS WILL REMAIN UPN AFFILIATES|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/business/company-news-nine-fox-owned-stations-will-remain-upn-affiliates.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 25, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094741/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/business/company-news-nine-fox-owned-stations-will-remain-upn-affiliates.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, UPN entered into a public bidding war to acquire two series from The WB, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', from producing studio [[20th Century Fox Television]]. UPN eventually outbid The WB for the shows and aired them together on Tuesday nights until ''Roswell'' ended its run in 2002, ''Buffy'' ended its run the following year. New shows began to breathe life into the network starting in the fall of 2003 with ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and sitcom ''[[All of Us]]'' (which was produced by [[Will Smith|Will]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), followed up by the fall 2004 premiere of the mystery series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' and the fall 2005 premiere of the [[Chris Rock]]-produced and narrated sitcom ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''.

===2005–2006: CBS era and network closure===
{{see also|2006 United States broadcast TV realignment}}
On June 14, 2005, Viacom announced that it would be split into two companies due to declining performance of the company's stock; both the original Viacom – which was renamed [[CBS Corporation]] – and a new company that took the [[Viacom]] name would be controlled by the original Viacom's parent [[National Amusements]] (controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]]). UPN became part of CBS Corporation, while the new Viacom kept Paramount Pictures among other holdings each company acquired in the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viacom Board Agrees to Split of Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 15, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306130603/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|archivedate=March 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SpongeBob or Survivor?|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/19/news/fortune500/viacom/index.htm|author=Paul R.

On January 24, 2006, UPN parent CBS Corporation and [[Time Warner]], the majority owner of The WB, announced that they would shut down the two respective networks and launch a new broadcast network that would be operated as a joint venture between both companies, [[The CW]], which incorporated UPN and The WB's higher-rated programs with newer series produced exclusively for The CW. The new network immediately signed 10-year affiliation agreements with 16 stations affiliated with The WB (out of 19 stations that were affiliated with the network) that were owned by that network's part-owner, the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] – including stations in the coveted markets of [[WPIX|New York City]], [[KTLA|Los Angeles]] and [[WGN-TV|Chicago]] – and 11 UPN stations that were owned by CBS Corporation.&lt;ref name="UPN, WB merge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 24, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017035638/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Television Stations' nine UPN affiliates were passed over for affiliations as a result, and two days later, those stations removed all UPN branding from those stations and ceasing promotion of the network's programs. One month later on February 22, Fox announced the formation of [[MyNetworkTV]], a new network that would also debut in September 2006 that would use the company's soon-to-be former UPN affiliates as the nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next eight months, determinations were made as to which shows from the two networks would cross over to The CW, as well as which of UPN and The WB's affiliate stations would be selected to become affiliates of the new network. Programming-wise, six UPN shows – ''America's Next Top Model'' (which was the last surviving series from UPN that remained on The CW's schedule until it moved to [[VH1]] in 2016), ''Veronica Mars'', ''Everybody Hates Chris'', ''Girlfriends'', ''All of Us'' and ''WWE Smackdown'' – were chosen to move to The CW for its inaugural 2006–07 fall schedule.

UPN quietly went off the air on September 15, 2006, at 9:59 PM EDT, ending the network's existence after 11 years. Unlike The WB, which closed its operations two days later with a special called "[[The Night of Favorites and Farewells]]", there was no promotion of UPN's signing off; rather, the network merely faded to black at the end of a ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' telecast without any fanfare. However, the Fox-owned UPN stations disaffiliated from the network on August 31; as a result, UPN's last two weeks of programming did not air in ten markets where Fox owned a UPN affiliate that was set to become an owned-and-operated station of MyNetworkTV, when that network launched on September 5, along with other markets where the local UPN station affiliated with MyNetworkTV or terminated their UPN affiliation during the summer. ''WWE SmackDown'', however, aired in those markets on Tribune's WB stations, including those that would join The CW shortly afterward. Nevertheless, with the exception of ''SmackDown'', all of the programs that aired during the network's final three months were reruns. After the network's official closure, UPN's website was redirected to The CW website, and then to CBS's website.

On February 9, 2017, Viacom announced that cable television channel Spike would take on the new branding of the '''[[Paramount Network]]''' in early 2018, as the company switches to a focus on six prime networks with most of the company's backing and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/spike-the-paramount-network-renamed-viacom-rebranding-1201906611/|title=Spike President On Channel's Rebranding As The Paramount Network|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=February 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210055944/http://deadline.com/2017/02/spike-the-paramount-network-renamed-viacom-rebranding-1201906611/|archivedate=February 10, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the fourth attempt at creating a network entity with the Paramount name, after the ''ad hoc'' [[Paramount Television Network]] in the early age of television, the 1978 [[Paramount Television Service]], which was planned and never launched, and an attempt in 2000 by Viacom to rebrand the broadcast United Paramount Network as the Paramount Network alone after joint partner [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]] sold their interest back to Viacom after selling their television stations to [[Fox Television Stations]], an effort aborted after affiliate rejection. The name change officially took place on January 18, 2018.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by UPN}}
At the time of its shutdown, UPN ran only two hours of primetime network programming on Monday through Fridays (compared to the three primetime hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sundays offered by the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks]], ABC, NBC and CBS). UPN never carried any weekend primetime programming throughout the network's run (though it did offer children's programming on weekend mornings until 2003, and a movie package to its affiliates on weekend afternoons until 2000, when the latter was replaced with a two-hour repeat block of UPN programs); as a result, affiliates held the responsibility of programming their Saturday and Sunday evening schedules with syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week due to special programming, in the 8:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]) time period. This primetime scheduling allowed for many of the network's affiliates to air local newscasts during the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period.

Most of UPN's programming through the years was produced by [[Paramount Television]] or a Viacom-owned sister company ([[Viacom Productions]], [[Big Ticket Entertainment]], [[Spelling Television]] or [[CBS Productions]]). UPN's first official program was ''Star Trek: Voyager'', with the first comedy shows to debut being two short-lived series: the [[Richard Jeni]] [[Star vehicle|starring vehicle]] ''Platypus Man'' and ''Pig Sty''.

Other notable UPN programs during the network's existence included ''The Sentinel'', ''Moesha'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', ''WWE SmackDown'', ''America's Next Top Model'', ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]'', the ''Moesha'' spin-off ''[[The Parkers]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''Everybody Hates Chris'', and ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]''. In the summer of [[2005 in television|2005]], UPN aired ''[[R U the Girl]]'', in which [[R&amp;B]] group [[TLC (music)|TLC]] searched for a woman to join them on a new song. The network also produced some special programs, including 2001's ''[[Iron Chef USA]]''. Much of UPN's comedy programming between 1996 and 2006 (particularly those that aired as part of the network's Monday evening lineup) was largely aimed at [[African American]] audiences, with minor exceptions in shows such as ''Clueless'', ''[[DiResta]]'' and ''[[Head over Heels (U.S. TV series)|Head Over Heels]]''.

UPN occasionally acquired series cancelled by the other broadcast networks, including former WB series ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Roswell'' (both of which moved to UPN in 2001, ''Buffy'' was picked up after The WB chose not to renew it due to issues with license fees while ''Roswell'' joined UPN after that same network also cancelled the series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN makes bid for 'Buffy'|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/upn-makes-bid-for-buffy-1117795697/|author=Josef Adalian|author2=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=March 21, 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094820/http://variety.com/2001/tv/news/upn-makes-bid-for-buffy-1117795697/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former ABC series ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]]'' and ''[[The Hughleys]]''. The first program that UPN acquired from another network was ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'', which moved to the network from [[NBC]] (which cancelled the [[LL Cool J]] sitcom after its second season) in 1996. In its later years, as part of the network's desire to maintain its own identity with its own unique shows, UPN instituted a policy of "not picking up other networks' scraps", which was a strong argument when fan pressure was generated in 2004 for them to pick up ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' which had been dropped from The WB.

UPN aired only one regular sports event program: the much-hyped [[XFL]] in 2001, airing Sunday evening games as part of a package from co-creator and [[WWE]] founder [[Vince McMahon]], which also included what was then ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'', and the only time the network carried programming officially outside of weeknights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN kicks off Sundays with extreme football|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/upn-kicks-off-sundays-with-extreme-football-1117781880/|author1=Paula Bernstein|author2=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095006/http://variety.com/2000/tv/news/upn-kicks-off-sundays-with-extreme-football-1117781880/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN had planned to air a second season of the XFL in 2002, but it also demanded that ''SmackDown!'' be reduced by 30 minutes; McMahon did not agree to the change and the football league folded not long afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s sudden death for XFL|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/it-s-sudden-death-for-xfl-1117799155/|author=John Dempsey|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 12, 2001|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095130/http://variety.com/2001/tv/news/it-s-sudden-death-for-xfl-1117799155/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News programming===
Like Fox and The WB, UPN never aired national morning or evening [[newscast]]s; however, several of its affiliates and owned-and-operated stations did produce their own local news programs. Several UPN affiliates ran a local newscast in the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific (9:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain Time) timeslot at some point during or throughout their affiliations with the network; there were also a few stations that produced a weekday morning newscast, although early evening newscasts were largely absent on most of these stations. The UPN affiliate body had fewer news-producing stations in comparison to stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) and considerably fewer than Fox and especially The WB. In several markets, the local UPN affiliate either outsourced news programming to an NBC, ABC or CBS station in the market (either due to insufficient funds or studio space for production of their own newscasts, or in later years after the FCC permitted duopolies in markets with at least eight unique station owners in 2000, the station being operated through a legal duopoly or [[local marketing agreement|management agreement]] with a major network affiliate); other affiliates opted to carry syndicated programming in the hour following UPN's primetime programming lineup.

When the network launched in January 1995, UPN automatically gained six affiliates with functioning news departments through Chris-Craft/United Television and Viacom's respective affiliation deals with the network, all of those stations started their news operations as either [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] or during prior affiliations with other networks: WWOR-TV/Secaucus, New Jersey (New York City), KCOP-TV/Los Angeles, [[WKBD-TV]]/[[Detroit]], [[KPTV]]/[[Portland, Oregon]], [[KMSP-TV]]/[[Minneapolis]] and [[WTOG]]/[[Tampa, Florida]]. Two more stations would join them later on: [[KSTW]]/[[Seattle]], also owned by Viacom at the time, after it affiliated with UPN in 1997 through the reversal of a 1995 affiliation switch with CBS affiliate [[KIRO-TV]] (which also kept its news department as a UPN affiliate), and KMAX-TV/Sacramento, which joined UPN after being acquired by Viacom in 1998 and began producing newscasts shortly after its 1995 affiliation with The WB. KSTW and WTOG's news departments were shut down in 1998 due to cost-cutting measures mandated by Viacom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News not Paramount|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53395671.html|author=Dan Trigoboff|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155349/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53395671.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WTOG to shutter news operation|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/1998/07/06/daily5.html|newspaper=Tampa Bay Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=July 7, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015095016/http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/1998/07/06/daily5.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of UPN's news-producing stations were owned by the two companies that formed the nuclei of the network's affiliate group; [[WUAB]]/[[Cleveland]], which started its news department in 1988, also continued its 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast as a UPN affiliate (it would begin producing newscasts for sister station [[WOIO|WOIO-TV]] in February 1995, after that station became a CBS affiliate; though WOIO eventually took over production of the newscast by 2002). [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] affiliate [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]] briefly continued its newscasts after switching to UPN from CBS in 1995, until [[WHP-TV]] began operating the station under a [[local marketing agreement]] that fall. [[WFTC]]/Minneapolis continued to produce a late evening newscast after [[Fox Television Stations]] (which acquired KMSP-TV through the Chris-Craft purchase, and converted it into a Fox O&amp;O) acquired the station from [[Clear Channel Communications]] and switched the station to UPN – it was moved to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to avoid competing with KMSP's 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast until the WFTC newscast was cancelled in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WFTC drops newscast at 10; KMSP adds it|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146555564.html|author=Deborah Caulfield Rybak|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|publisher=[[Glen Taylor|Star Tribune Media Company LLC]]|date=June 2, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924135521/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146555564.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of KPTV and KMSP, both of which are now Fox stations, none of the former UPN affiliates that produced newscasts during their affiliation with the network continue to maintain an independent news department – despite license requirements imposed by the station's 1983 transfer of its license to Secaucus, New Jersey from New York City to cover New Jersey issues, WWOR-TV, which continued to produce news programming after coming under common ownership with Fox O&amp;O [[WNYW]], shut down its news department in July 2013 and replaced its lone 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast with an outside produced program called ''Chasing New Jersey'', a move that resulted in calls by state politicians for the FCC to revoke Fox's license to operate the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox ends MY9 News, will replace it with an interview show|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/07/fox_ends_my9_news_will_replace.html|author=Alexi Friedman|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705174357/http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/07/fox_ends_my9_news_will_replace.html|archivedate=July 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criticism continues over WWOR's cancellation of N.J. newscast|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/criticism_continues_over_wwors_cancellation_of_nj_newcast.html|author=Peggy McGlone|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|publisher=Advance Publications|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Chasing New Jersey' news show fails to win over Channel 9 critics|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130709/NJNEWS/307090041/-Chasing-New-Jersey-news-show-fails-win-over-Channel-9-critics?nclick_check=1|author=Sergio Bichao|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229235444/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130709/NJNEWS/307090041/-Chasing-New-Jersey-news-show-fails-win-over-Channel-9-critics?nclick_check=1|archivedate=December 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KTTV]] took over production of sister station KCOP's newscasts in 2007, before discontinuing news programming on that station in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KCOP Cutting News From its Lineup|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kcop-cutting-news-from-its-lineup/101140|author=Kevin Eck|website=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Mediabistro Holdings]]|date=August 9, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922183955/http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kcop-cutting-news-from-its-lineup/101140|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KCOP to drop news from the lineup|url=http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2013/08/kcop_to_drop_news_from_th.php|author=Kevin Roderick|newspaper=LA Observed|date=August 10, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010103647/http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2013/08/kcop_to_drop_news_from_th.php|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; KMAX's news department has since been merged with that of KOVR although it still produces a morning newscast separate from that station.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|UPN Kids|Disney's One Too}}
When the network launched in January 1995, UPN debuted a weekend morning cartoon block called ''[[UPN Kids]]'' (later called "The UPN Kids Action Zone" during the 1998–99 season). In 1997, UPN added two teen-oriented series to the lineup with reruns of the syndicated ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' (based on the young adult book series by [[Francine Pascal]]) and a new series, ''[[Breaker High]]'' (which co-starred a then-unknown [[Ryan Gosling]]); both shows filled the weekday morning block for the 1997–98 season, while they were also included alongside the animated series on Sunday mornings. Unlike other networks, UPN gave its affiliates the option of running its weekend children's program block on either Saturdays or Sundays. In January 1998, the network entered into a deal with [[Saban Entertainment]] to program the Sunday morning block (with shows such as ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' joining the lineup).&lt;ref name="Disney talks called off"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN kids pick Nick, not Mouse|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/upn-kids-pick-nick-not-mouse-1117467104/|last=Hontz|first=Jenny|work=Variety|date=January 27, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211100554/http://variety.com/1998/biz/news/upn-kids-pick-nick-not-mouse-1117467104/|archivedate=December 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvel, Saban set kids shows for UPN|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/marvel-saban-set-kids-shows-for-upn-1117467216/|last=Katz|first=Richard|work=Variety|date=January 29, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115808/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/marvel-saban-set-kids-shows-for-upn-1117467216/|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN serves up superheroes|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-serves-up-superheroes-1117468038/|last=Katz|first=Richard|work=Variety|date=February 24, 1998|accessdate=August 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094918/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-serves-up-superheroes-1117468038/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, UPN contracted the rights to the network's children's programming lineup to [[The Walt Disney Company]]; as a result, the teen-oriented and animated series were replaced with a new block called ''[[Disney's One Too]]'', which debuted on September 6, 1999, and featured select programs seen on ABC's ''[[ABC Kids (United States)#Disney's One Saturday Morning|Disney's One Saturday Morning]]'' lineup (such as ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'' and ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mouse brands UPN kidvid|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/mouse-brands-upn-kidvid-1117743063/|last=Pursell|first=Chris|work=Variety|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=August 17, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402212916/http://variety.com/1999/tv/news/mouse-brands-upn-kidvid-1117743063/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UPN affiliates at the network's launch were already airing [[The Disney Afternoon]], a block supplied by Disney-owned syndication distributor [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]]; however, that block would be discontinued in August 1997. The addition of ''Disney's One Too'' expanded UPN's children's program block back to two hours, running on Sunday mornings and weekday afternoons. In September 2002, ''[[Digimon: Digital Monsters]]'' moved to UPN from [[Fox Kids]], due to Disney's acquisition of Fox's children's program inventory as well as the Fox Family Channel, which was renamed [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#ABC Family|ABC Family]] the previous year. At the same time, the "One Too" branding was dropped from on-air usage due to the rebranding of ABC's Saturday morning lineup from ''One Saturday Morning'' to ''ABC Kids'' (although the block was unofficially referred to as ''Disney's Animation Weekdays'' outside the network). UPN subsequently chose not to renew its contract with Disney, with the network dropping all children's programming after August 31, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Drops UPN Programming Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/14/business/fi-rup14.6|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 14, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094902/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/14/business/fi-rup14.6|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN to ax Disney kids shows in fall|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1473784.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group|Hollinger International]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=February 15, 2003|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1473784.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left UPN as one of only two major broadcast networks that did not air a children's programming block, the other being Pax TV, which discontinued its ''Pax Kids'' lineup in 2000, before reviving children's programming as [[Ion Television]] through the 2007 launch of [[Qubo]]. Incidentally, UPN's successor The CW carried over the [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning lineup from fellow predecessor The WB, resulting in UPN affiliates that joined The CW in September 2006 carrying network-supplied children's programming for the first time since the ''One Too'' block ended.

Some Fox stations that declined to carry [[4Kids TV]] passed on that block to an affiliate of UPN or The WB, or an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], in order for the Fox affiliate to air general entertainment programming or local newscasts on Saturday mornings (for example, [[WFLD]] in [[Chicago]] moved the 4Kids TV schedule to co-owned then-UPN affiliate [[WPWR-TV]], while WFLD aired infomercials).

===Television movies===
{{Main|List of television films produced for UPN}}
During the late 1990s, UPN produced a number of [[television film|television movies]] under the umbrella brand ''Blockbuster Shockwave Cinema'', in conjunction with sponsor (and then-sister company) [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]], almost all of which were [[science fiction film]]s.

From UPN's inception until 2000, the network also offered a hosted movie series called the ''UPN Movie Trailer'' to its stations. The weekend block featured mostly older theatrically released action and comedy films, often those from the [[Paramount Pictures]] film library. The ''Movie Trailer'' block was discontinued in 2000 to give stations that opted for them room for a two-hour block of select UPN series that aired in primetime during the previous week. There were also three Paramount-branded blocks that aired on Viacom's UPN owned-and-operated stations between 1995 and 2000: the ''Paramount Teleplex'' as the main brand for movies at any given timeslot, the ''Paramount Prime Movie'' for primetime features, and the ''Paramount Late Movie'' for films airing in late night timeslots.

==Affiliates==
{{Main|List of former UPN affiliates}}
UPN had approximately 143 full-power owned-and-operated or primary affiliate stations in the U.S., and another 65 stations aired some UPN programming as secondary affiliates. Although it was considered a major network by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] for [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] purposes, UPN was not available in every American [[media market|television market]]. In some areas, UPN programming was shown off-pattern by affiliates of other networks (airing immediately after programming from their primary network on some Fox and WB stations, or during overnight timeslots on major network affiliates) or by otherwise independent stations, such as in the case of [[KIKU|KIKU-TV]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Some affiliates were also known to extensively preempt network programming in order to broadcast local sporting events.

By 2003, UPN had an estimated audience reach of 85.98% of all U.S. households (equivalent to 91,689,290 households with at least one television set). In contrast, The WB was viewable in 91.66% of all U.S. television homes. This is mainly because UPN did not have wide distribution in areas ranked below the top 100 Nielsen-designated media markets, whereas The WB operated [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] – a [[cable television|cable]]-only station group that was launched by the network in September 1998 – to provide broad coverage to those markets (from January 1995 to October 1999, The WB's programming was carried over the [[WGN America|superstation feed]] of the network's Chicago affiliate [[WGN-TV]] through a programming agreement with its owner Tribune Broadcasting). Despite the fact that UPN would not be able to have extensive small-market coverage at launch due to a lack of commercial television stations in those areas, Paramount Television denied [[Advance Publications|Advance Entertainment Corporation]] permission from distributing the network's programming over the [[WWOR EMI Service]], the [[superstation]] feed of New York City affiliate WWOR-TV, preventing the network from reaching markets without an exclusive or secondary UPN affiliate. The network proposed launching a cable-originated service to increase its distribution to markets without an over-the-air affiliate in July 1998; however, the service, which was to have been named UPN Plus, ultimately never launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN working on 24-hour cable channel|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-working-on-24-hour-cable-channel-1117478702/|author=John Dempsey|author2=Jenny Hontz|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=July 22, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015094526/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/upn-working-on-24-hour-cable-channel-1117478702/|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN did have one cable-only affiliate in its station body, [[WNFM-TV]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Florida]], which joined the network in 1998.

In markets where Viacom had a CBS/UPN [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] after its 2000 merger with CBS, the UPN station was used to air CBS network programs in the event that local sporting events or extended [[breaking news]] coverage would air on the CBS station, sometimes resulting in UPN programs being pre-empted outright, as the CBS-owned outlets were usually the senior partner in the duopolies (an exception being [[Detroit]], where [[WKBD-TV]] is considered the senior partner to [[WWJ-TV]] due to WKBD being longer-established). One such event occurred on September 26, 2004, when [[Hurricane Jeanne]] forced a scheduled [[National Football League|NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Miami]] to be postponed from its scheduled start time of 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; the game aired locally on [[KDKA-TV]] and [[WFOR-TV]] while their respective UPN sister stations, [[WPCW|WNPA-TV]] and [[WBFS-TV]], aired CBS's regular Sunday night programming instead.

These factors led to the network struggling in the ratings over much of UPN's existence, with its later ''Star Trek'' franchise, ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', perhaps suffering the most and ultimately being cancelled by the network in a controversial decision in February 2005. The most consistent ratings performer for the network was ''[[WWE SmackDown]]''. During the 2004-2005 season, the network was getting consistently better ratings than The WB, much of this thanks to its carriage of the WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UPN's Start-of-Week Blues|author=John Consoli|periodical=Mediaweek|date=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Station standardization===
When the network launched, UPN began having most of its stations branded using a combination of "UPN" or "Paramount" (the latter having been used only by the network's Viacom-owned stations, some of whom adopted the "Paramount" branding prior to UPN's launch), and the affiliated station's channel number. By the late 1990s, affiliates were simply branded under the "UPN (channel number or city)" scheme (for example, Chicago affiliate WPWR-TV called itself "UPN Chicago" and New York City O&amp;O-turned-affiliate WWOR-TV was referred to as "UPN 9", until The CW's launch was announced in January 2006).

However, most of the UPN owned-and-operated stations under Viacom/CBS Corporation branded themselves by the network/city conventions (for example, [[KBCW (TV)|KBHK]]/[[San Francisco]] was branded as "UPN Bay Area," [[WKBD-TV|WKBD]]/[[Detroit]] was branded as "UPN Detroit" and [[WUPL]]/[[New Orleans]] was branded as "UPN New Orleans"). That type of branding did not always apply though, as for example, [[WSBK-TV]]/[[Boston]] was branded "UPN 38" and [[KMAX-TV]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] was branded "UPN 31". [[WPCW|WNPA]]/[[Pittsburgh]] originally branded itself as "UPN 19", but rebranded itself as "UPN Pittsburgh" soon after the network introduced its second and final logo in September 2002, making it one of the few that had carried both standardization styles. Many UPN-affiliated stations followed the same branding scheme (for example, [[KFVE]]/[[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] used the brand "UPN Hawaii").

This would be a continuation of the trend of networks using such naming schemes, which originated at Fox (and even earlier by [[CBC Television]] in Canada), and was also predominately used at CBS (which has most of its owned-and-operated stations, with a few exceptions, brand using a combination of the network's name and over-the-air channel number) and The WB (with the exception of its Tribune Broadcasting-owned affiliates in Los Angeles and Chicago, and certain other stations); NBC and ABC also use similar branding schemes, but not to the same universal level outside their O&amp;Os. While the "Big Three" networks do not require their affiliates to have such naming schemes (though some affiliates choose to adopt it anyway) and only on the network's O&amp;Os is the style required, UPN mandated it on all stations – though in one case, [[Milwaukee]] affiliate [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] branded as "Channel 24" from 1998 to 2001, excluding UPN imagery from its station branding (WCGV, which previously branded as "UPN 24", had disaffiliated from the network for eight months in 1998 due to a compensation dispute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinclair pulling more UPN affiliations|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20115938.html|author=Joe Schlosser|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 5, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151246/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20115938.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN, Sinclair make up|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50228020.html|author=Steve McClellan|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 3, 1998|accessdate=September 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155249/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50228020.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas''' encompasses the visual [[art]]istic traditions of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from ancient times to the present. These include works from South America, Mesoamerica, North America including [[Greenland]], as well as [[Siberian Yup'ik]] peoples who have great cultural overlap with [[Native Alaskan]] [[Yup'ik]]s.

==Lithic and Archaic stage==
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art|Petroglyph|Pictogram|Petroform|Rock art|Stone tools}}
In North America, the [[Lithic stage]] or [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]] is defined as approximately 18,000–8000 BCE.  The period from around 8000–800 BCE is generally referred to as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]]. The production of [[bannerstone]]s, [[Projectile point]], [[Lithic reduction]] styles and pictographic cave paintings are some of the art that remains from this time period.

Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is a carved [[megafauna]] bone, possibly from a mammoth, etched with a profile of walking [[mammoth]] or [[mastodon]] that dates back to 11,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/06/2011/ice-age-art-from-florida|title=Ice Age Art from Florida|publisher=Past Horizons|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bone was found early in the 21st century near [[Vero Beach, Florida]], in an area where human bones ([[Vero man]]) had been found in association with extinct [[pleistocene]] animals early in the 20th century. The bone is too [[Fossil|mineralized]] to be dated, but the carving has been authenticated as having been made before the bone became mineralized.

===Arctic===
{{See also|Inuit art|Alaska Native Art}}
The [[Yup'ik]] of Alaska have a long tradition of carving [[Yup'ik masks|masks]] for use in [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanic]] rituals. Indigenous peoples of the Canadian arctic have produced objects that could be classified as art since the time of the [[Dorset culture]]. While the walrus ivory carvings of the Dorset were primarily shamanic, the art of the [[Thule people]] who replaced them circa 1000 CE was more decorative in character. With European contact the historic period of Inuit art began. In this period, which reached its height in the late 19th century, Inuit artisans created souvenirs for the crews of whaling ships and explorers. Common examples include [[cribbage]] boards. Modern Inuit art began in the late 1940s, when with the encouragement of the Canadian government they began to produce prints and [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] sculptures for sale in the south. [[Greenlandic Inuit]]  have a unique textile tradition intregrating skin-sewing, furs, and appliqué of small pieces of brightly dyed marine mammal organs in mosaic designs, called [[avittat]]. Women create elaborate netted beadwork collars. They have strong mask-making tradition and also are known for an art form called ''[[tupilaq]]'' or an "evil spirit object." Traditional art making practices thrive in the [[Ammassalik]].&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subarctic====
Cultures of interior Alaska and Canada living south of the [[Arctic Circle]] are [[Subarctic peoples]]. While humans have lived in the region far longer, the oldest known surviving Subarctic art is a petroglyph site in northwest [[Ontario]], dated to 5000 BCE. [[Caribou]], and to a lesser extent [[moose]], are major resources, providing hides, antlers, sinew, and other artistic materials. Porcupine [[quillwork]] embellishes hides and birchbark. After European contact with the influence of the [[Grey Nuns]], moosehair [[tufting]] and floral glass beadwork became popular through the Subarctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-art-in-canada.com/nativeart.html A History of Native Art in Canada and North America.] ''Native Art in Canada.'' 11.June.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Heiltsuk]], [[Tsimshian]] and other smaller tribes living in the coastal areas of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]], is characterized by an extremely complex stylistic vocabulary expressed mainly in the medium of woodcarving. Famous examples include [[totem pole]]s, [[transformation mask]]s, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.

===Eastern Woodlands===

====Northeastern Woodlands====
The [[Eastern Woodlands]], or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the [[Mississippi River]] at least since 2500 BCE. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]].

The [[Woodland period]] (1000 BCE–1000 CE) is divided into early, middle, and late periods, and consisted of cultures that relied mostly on hunting and gathering for their subsistence. Ceramics made by the [[Deptford culture]] (2500 BCE–100 CE) are the earliest evidence of an artistic tradition in this region. The [[Adena culture]] are another well-known example of an early Woodland culture. They carved stone tablets with [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] designs, created [[Hopewell pottery|pottery]], and fashioned costumes from animal hides and antlers for ceremonial rituals. Shellfish was a mainstay of their diet, and engraved shells have been found in their burial mounds.

The [[Middle Woodland period]] was dominated by cultures of the [[Hopewell tradition]] (200–500). Their [[Hopewell tradition#Artwork|artwork]] encompassed a wide variety of jewelry and sculpture in stone, wood, and even human bone.

The [[Late Woodland period]] (500–1000 CE) saw a decline in trade and in the size of settlements, and the creation of art likewise declined.

From the 12th century onward, the [[Iroquois]] and nearby coastal tribes fashioned [[wampum]] from shells and string; these were [[mnemonic]] devices, currency, and records of treaties.

Iroquois people carve [[False Face mask]]s for healing rituals, but the traditional representatives of the tribes, the Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]], are clear that these masks are not for sale or public display.&lt;ref name=false&gt;Shenadoah, Chief Leon. [http://www.peace4turtleisland.org/pages/maskpolicy.htm Haudenosaunee Confederacy Policy On False Face Masks.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712004902/http://www.peace4turtleisland.org/pages/maskpolicy.htm |date=12 July 2013 }} ''Peace 4 Turtle Island''. 2001.

One fine art sculptor of the mid-nineteenth century was [[Edmonia Lewis]] (African American / Ojibwe). Two of her works are held by the [[Newark Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallery.newarkmuseum.org/view/people/asitem/L/21?t:state:flow=352caad0-4bcf-46f3-b777-195bf21b76ca Newark Museum - Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Native peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands continued to make visual art through the 20th and 21st centuries. One such artist is Sharol Graves, whose serigraphs have been exhibited in the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NMAI Indian Humor - Graves|url=http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/indian_humor/exhibit/15.htm|website=National Museum of the American Indian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=25 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426230405/http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/indian_humor/exhibit/15.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2009|location=Internet Archive|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves is also the illustrator of ''[https://www.leeandlow.com/books/the-people-shall-continue The People Shall Continue]'' from [[Lee &amp; Low Books]].

The [[Poverty Point culture]] inhabited portions of the state of [[Louisiana]] from 2000 to 1000 BCE during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/popo/hd_popo.htm|title=Poverty Point-2000 to 1000 BCE|accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, including chipped stone projectile points and tools, ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels, and shell and stone beads. Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee River]] valleys. Vessels were made from [[soapstone]] which came from the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian foothills]] of [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/parks/ipvertypt.aspx|title=CRT-Louisiana State Parks Fees, Facilities and Activities|accessdate=2 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207140451/http://crt.state.la.us/parks/ipvertypt.aspx|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomophic figurines and cooking balls.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;

The [[Mississippian culture]] flourished in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and [[Southeastern United States]] from approximately 800 CE to 1500 CE, varying regionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-707 Mississippian Period: Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; After adopting [[maize]] agriculture the Mississippian culture became fully agrarian, as opposed to the hunting and gathering supplemented by part-time agriculture practiced by preceding woodland cultures. They built [[platform mound]]s larger and more complex than those of their predecessors, and finished and developed more advanced ceramic techniques, commonly using ground [[mussel]] [[Shell tempered pottery|shell as a tempering agent]]. Many were involved with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], a pan-regional and pan-linguistic religious and trade network. The majority of the information known about the S.E.C.C. is derived from examination of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery]], [[shell gorget]]s and cups, [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]], [[Mississippian copper plates|repoussé copper plates]] such as the [[Wulfing cache]], [[Rogan plates]], and [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s. By the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress, and with the political upheavals and diseases introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with notable exceptions being the [[Plaquemine culture]] [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and related [[Taensa]] peoples. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the [[Caddo]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]], and many other southeastern peoples.

A large number of pre-Columbian wooden artifacts have been found in Florida. While the oldest wooden artifacts are as much as 10,000 years old, carved and painted wooden objects are known only from the past 2,000 years. Animal effigies and face masks have been found at a number of sites in Florida. Animal effigies dating to between 200 and 600 were found in a mortuary pond at [[Fort Center]], on the west side of [[Lake Okeechobee]]. Particularly impressive is a 66&amp;nbsp;cm tall carving of an eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purdy|first=Barbara A.|title=Indian Art of Ancient Florida|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1462-X|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{commons|Key Marco}}
More than 1,000 carved and painted wooden objects, including masks, tablets, plaques and effigies, were excavated in 1896 at [[Key Marco]], in [[southwestern Florida]]. They have been described as some of the finest prehistoric Native American art in North America. The objects are not well dated, but may belong to the first millienium of the current era. Spanish missionaries described similar masks and effigies in use by the [[Calusa]] late in the 17th century, and at the former [[Tequesta]] site on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] in 1743, although no examples of the Calusa objects from the historic period have survived.

===The West===

====Great Plains====
Tribes have lived on the [[Great Plains]] for thousands of years. Early Plains cultures are commonly divided into four periods: Paleoindian (at least c. 10,000–4000 BCE), Plains Archaic (c. 4000–250 BCE), Plains Woodland (c. 250 BCE–950 CE), Plains Village (c. 950-1850 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn, Anne. [http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/naa/naa_web/mod10.html "Peoples of the Great Plains".] ''Indiana University.''. Retrieved 29 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known painted object in North American was found in the southern plains, the [[Cooper Bison Skull]], found in Oklahoma and dated 10,900-10,200 BCE. It's painted with a red zizzag.&lt;ref name=bement/&gt;

In the Plains Village period, the cultures of the area settled in enclosed clusters of rectangular houses and cultivated [[maize]]. Various regional differences emerged, including Southern Plains, Central Plains, [[Oneota]], and Middle Missouri. Tribes were both nomadic hunters and semi-nomadic farmers. During the ''Plains Coalescent period'' (1400-European contact) some change, possibly drought, caused the mass migration of the population to the Eastern Woodlands region, and the Great Plains were sparsely populated until pressure from American settlers drove tribes into the area again.

The advent of the horse revolutionized the cultures of many historical Plains tribes. [[Horse culture]] enabled tribes to live a completely nomadic existence, hunting buffalo. Buffalo hide clothing was decorated with [[quillwork|porcupine quill embroidery]] and beads – dentalium shells and elk teeth were prized materials. Later coins and glass beads acquired from trading were incorporated into Plains art. Plains [[beadwork]] has flourished into contemporary times.

Buffalo was the preferred material for [[Plains hide painting]]. Men painted narrative, pictorial designs recording personal exploits or visions. They also painted pictographic historical calendars known as [[Winter count]]s. Women painted geometric designs on tanned robes and rawhide [[parfleche]]s, which sometimes served as maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationgis.org/native/native1.html "Native American and First Nations' GIS."] ''Native Geography.'' Dec 2000. Retrieved 29 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Reservation Era of the late 19th century, buffalo herds were systematically destroyed by non-native hunters. Due to the scarcity of hides, Plains artists adopted new painting surfaces, such as muslin or paper, giving birth to [[Ledger art]], so named for the ubiquitous ledger books used by Plains artists.

====Great Basin and Plateau====
Since the archaic period the Plateau region, also known as the [[Intermontane|Intermontaine]] and upper [[Great Basin]], had been a center of trade. Plateau people traditionally settled near major river systems.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, their art carries influences from other regions – from the Pacific Northwest coasts and Great Plains. [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]], [[Yakama]], [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], and [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] women weave flat, rectangular corn husks or [[hemp dogbane]] bags, which are decorated with "bold, geometric designs" in false embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Plateau beadworkers are known for their contour-style beading and their elaborate horse regalia.

[[Great Basin tribes]] have a sophisticated basket making tradition, as exemplified by [[Dat So La Lee]]/Louisa Keyser ([[Washoe people|Washoe]]), [[Lucy Telles]], [[Carrie Bethel]] and [[Nellie Charlie]]. After being displaced from their lands by non-Native settlers, Washoe wove baskets for the commodity market, especially 1895 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]], [[Shoshone]] and Washoe basketmakers are known for their baskets that incorporate seed beads on the surface and for waterproof baskets.&lt;ref&gt;Garey-Sage, Darla.

In the late 19th-century Californian [[basket]]s by artists in the [[Cahuilla]], [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Pomo]], [[Miwok]], [[Hupa]] and many other tribes became popular with collectors, museums, and tourists. This resulted in great innovation in the form of the baskets. Many pieces by [[List of Native American artists#Basket weavers|Native American basket weavers]] from all parts of California are in museum collections, such as the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]], the [[Autry National Center|Southwest Museum]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

California has a large number of [[pictograph]]s and [[petroglyphs]] [[rock art]]. One of the largest densities of [[petroglyphs]] in North America, by the [[Coso people]], is in [[Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]] of the northern [[Mojave Desert]] in California.

The most elaborate pictographs in the U.S are considered to be the [[rock art of the Chumash people]], found in [[cave painting]]s in present-day [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]], and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo Counties]]. The [[Chumash people|Chumash]] [[cave painting]] includes examples at [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, California|Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park]] and [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]].

===Southwest===
{{See also|Oasisamerica}}
In the [[Southwestern United States]] numerous pictographs and petroglyphs were created. The [[Fremont culture]] and [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] and later tribes' creations, in the [[Barrier Canyon Style]] and others, are seen at present day [[Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel]] and [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]], amongst other sites. Petroglyphs by these and the [[Mogollon culture]]'s artists are represented in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] and at [[Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument|Newspaper Rock]].

The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Ancestral Pueblo]], or Anasazi, (1000 BCE–700 CE) are the ancestors of today's [[Pueblo peoples|Pueblo tribes]]. Their culture formed in the American southwest, after the cultivation of corn was introduced from Mexico around 1200 BCE. People of this region developed an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating food, storage gourds, and cotton with irrigation or [[xeriscaping]] techniques. They lived in sedentary towns, so pottery, used to store water and grain, was ubiquitous.

For hundreds of years, Ancestral Pueblo created utilitarian grayware and black-on-white pottery and occasionally orange or red ceramics.  In historical times, [[Hopi]] created [[olla]]s, dough bowls, and food bowls of different sizes for daily use, but they also made more elaborate ceremonial mugs, jugs, ladles, seed jars and those vessels for ritual use, and these were usually finished with polished surfaces and decorated with black painted designs. At the turn of the 20th century, Hopi potter [[Nampeyo]] famous revived [[Sikyátki]]-style pottery, originated on First Mesa in the 14th to 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/sikyatki.shtml "Ancestral Hopi Pottery".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208035314/http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/sikyatki.shtml |date=8 February 2008 }} ''Arizona State Museum''. 2007. Retrieved 14 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwest architecture includes [[Cliff dwelling]]s, multi-story settlements carved from [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]]; [[pit house]]s; and [[adobe]] and [[sandstone]] [[pueblo]]s. One of the most elaborate and largest ancient settlements is [[Chaco Canyon]] in [[New Mexico]], which includes 15 major complexes of sandstone and timber. These are connected by a network of roads. Construction for the largest of these settlements, [[Pueblo Bonito]], began 1080 years [[before present]]. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/northamerica/chaco.html "Chaco Canyon."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604094657/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/northamerica/chaco.html |date=4 June 2010 }} ''Minnesota State Museum, Mankato''. Retrieved 14 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turquoise]], jet, and spiny oyster shell have been traditionally used by Ancestral Pueblo for jewelry, and they developed sophisticated [[inlay]] techniques centuries ago.

Around 200 CE the [[Hohokam]] culture developed in Arizona. They are the ancestors of the [[Tohono O'odham]] and [[Akimel O'odham]] or Pima tribes. The [[Mimbres culture|Mimbres]], a subgroup of the [[Mogollon culture]], are especially notable for the narrative paintings on their pottery.

Within the last millennium, [[Athabaskan]] peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. [[Sandpainting]] is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by [[Great Basin]] and [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing [[Navajo rug|rugs]] for trade.

In the 1850s, Navajos adopted [[silversmith]]ing from the Mexicans. [[Atsidi Sani]] (Old Smith) was the first Navajo silversmith, but he had many students, and the technology quickly spread to surrounding tribes. Today thousands of artists produce silver jewelry with turquoise. [[Hopi#Culture|Hopi]] are renowned for their overlay silver work and cottonwood carvings. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
[[File:Mesoamerica english.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Mesoamerican cultural region.]]
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art#Mesoamerica and Central America}}
The cultural development of ancient [[Mesoamerica]] was generally divided along east and west. The stable Maya culture was most dominant in the east, especially the Yucatán Peninsula, while in the west more varied developments took place in subregions. These included [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|West Mexican]] (1000–1), Teotihuacan (1–500), Mixtec (1000–1200), and Aztec (1200–1521).

[[Central America]]n civilizations generally lived to the regions south of modern-day Mexico, although there was some overlap.

===Mesoamerica===
{{See also|Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerica#Chronology_and_culture}}
Mesoamerica was home to the following cultures, among others:

====Olmec====
{{Main|Olmec figurine|Olmec#Art}}
The Olmec (1500-400 BCE), who lived on the gulf coast, were the [[first civilization]] to fully develop in Mesoamerica. Their culture was the first to develop many traits that remained constant in Mesoamerica until the last days of the Aztecs: a complex astronomical calendar, the ritual practice of a [[Mesoamerican ball game|ball game]], and the erection of [[stela]]e to commemorate victories or other important events.

The most famous artistic creations of the Olmec are [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal basalt heads]], believed to be portraits of rulers that were erected to advertise their great power. The Olmec also sculpted votive [[Olmec figurine|figurines]] that they buried beneath the floors of their houses for unknown reasons. These were most often modeled in terracotta, but also occasionally carved from [[jade]] or [[Serpentinite|serpentine]].
&lt;gallery widths="140" heights="140" perrow="4"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Teotihuacan====
[[Teotihuacan]] was a city built in the [[Valley of Mexico]], containing some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] built in the [[pre-Columbian]] [[The Americas|Americas]]. Established around 200 BCE, the city fell between the 7th and 8th century CE. Teotihuacan has numerous well-preserved [[mural]]s.

====Classic Veracruz Culture====

{{Main|Remojadas|Classic Veracruz Culture#Ceramics}}

In his 1957 book on Mesoamerican art, [[Miguel Covarrubias]] speaks of Remojadas' "magnificent hollow figures with expressive faces, in majestic postures and wearing elaborate paraphernalia indicated by added clay elements."&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Zapotec====
"The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec&amp;nbsp;... He was especially associated&amp;nbsp;... with the underworld."{{attribution needed |date=September 2018 }}&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1929, p. 182, from Richardson 1932, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Zapotec center was [[Monte Alban]], in present-day [[Oaxaca]], Mexico. The Monte Alban periods are divided into I, II, and III, which range from 200 BCE to 600 CE.

The native civilizations were most developed in the [[Andes mountains|Andean region]], where they are roughly divided into Northern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the Southern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Peru]] and [[Chilé]].

Hunter-gatherer tribes throughout the [[Amazon rainforest]] of [[Brazil]] also have developed artistic traditions involving tattooing and body painting. Because of their remoteness, these tribes and their art have not been studied as thoroughly as Andean cultures, and many even remain [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]].

{{See also|Weaving#Amazonia}}
Traditionally limited in access to stone and metals, Amazonian [[indigenous people]]s excel at featherwork, painting, textiles, and ceramics. [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]] (Cave of the Painted Rock) in the [[Pará]] state of [[Brazil]] houses the oldest firmly dated art in the Americas – rock paintings dating back 11,000 years. The cave is also the site of the oldest ceramics in the Americas, from 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name=cave&gt;Wilford, John Noble.

The Island of [[Marajó]], at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] was a major center of ceramic traditions as early as 1000 CE&lt;ref name=cave/&gt; and continues to produce ceramics today, characterized by cream-colored bases painted with linear, geometric designs of red, black, and white [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]].

With access to a wide range of native bird species, Amazonian [[indigenous people]]s excel at feather work, creating brilliant colored headdresses, jewelry, clothing, and fans. Iridescent beetle wings are incorporated into earrings and other jewelry. Weaving and basketry also thrive in the Amazon, as noted among the [[Urarina]] of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean.

==Modern and contemporary==
[[File:Phoenix indian school 1900.jpg|thumb|Drawing class at the Phoenix Indian School, 1900]]

===Beginnings of contemporary Native American art===
Pinpointing the exact time of emergence of "modern" and contemporary Native art is problematic. In the past, Western art historians have considered use of Western art media or exhibiting in international art arena as criteria for "modern" Native American art history.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Native American art history is a new and highly contested academic discipline, and these Eurocentric benchmarks are followed less and less today. Many media considered appropriate for easel art were employed by Native artists for centuries, such as stone and wood sculpture and mural painting. [[Ancestral Pueblo]] artists painted with tempera on woven cotton fabric, at least 800 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, p. xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Native artists used non-Indian art materials as soon as they became available. For example, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocan]] artist [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl]] painted with ink and watercolor on paper in the late 16th century. Bound together in the [[Codex]] Ixtlilxóchitl, these portraits of historical Texcocan leaders are rendered with shading, modeling and anatomic accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, pp. 554–555.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuzco School]] of Peru featured [[Quechua people|Quechua]] easel painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] in the 16th century, precursors to modern museums, featured Native American art.

It should be noted that the notion that fine art cannot be functional has not gained widespread acceptance in the Native American art world, as evidenced by the high esteem and value placed upon rugs, blankets, basketry, weapons, and other utilitarian items in Native American art shows. A dichotomy between [[fine art]] and [[craft]] is not commonly found in contemporary Native art. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] honors its greatest artists as Living Treasures, including frog- and [[Gigging|fish-gig]] makers, [[Knapping|flint knappers]], and [[Basket weaving|basket weavers]], alongside sculptors, painters, and textile artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Will. [http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/2179/Article.aspx 2006 Cherokee National Living Treasure artists announced.] ''The Cherokee Phoenix.'' 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Dawn Ades writes, "Far from being inferior, or purely decorative, crafts like textiles or ceramics, have always had the possibility of being the bearers of vital knowledge, beliefs and myths."&lt;ref&gt;Ades, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizable art markets between Natives and non-Natives emerged upon contact, but the 1820–1840s were a highly prolific time. In the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, tribes dependent upon the rapidly diminishing fur trade adopted art production a means of financial support. A painting movement known as the [[Iroquois Realist School]] emerged among the Haudenosaunee in [[New York (state)|New York]] in the 1820s, spearheaded by the brothers [[David Cusick|David]] and [[Dennis Cusick]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Ojibwe sculptor, [[Edmonia Lewis]] maintained a studio in Rome, Italy and carved [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] marble sculptors from the 1860s-1880s. Her mother belonged to the [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] band of the [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|Credit River Indian Reserve]]. Lewis exhibited widely, and a testament to her popularity during her own time was that President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] commissioned her to carve his portrait in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 12, 14, 108, and 120&lt;/ref&gt;

She strove to be tribally specific in her work and was revolutionary for portraying Indians in contemporary clothing of the early 20th century. She taught art to young Native students at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] and was an outspoken advocate of art as a means for Native Americans to maintain cultural pride, while finding a place in mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, p. 754&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kiowa Five]] or [[Kiowa Six]], a group of Kiowa painters from Oklahoma, met with international success when their mentor, Oscar Jacobson, showed their paintings in First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!85940!0&amp;term= Pochoir prints of ledger drawings by the Kiowa Five, 1929.] ''Smithsonian Institution Research Information System''.

The [[Santa Fe Indian Market]] began in 1922. [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] became Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1933 and temporarily reversed the BIA's assimilationist policies by encouraging Native American arts and culture. By this time, Native American art exhibits and the art market increased, gaining wider audiences. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Indigenist]] art movements flourished in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]], most famously with the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican Muralist movements]].

===Basketry===
[[File:Yahgan basket.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional [[Yahgan]] basket, woven by Abuela [[Cristina Calderón]], Chile, photo by Jim Cadwell]][[Basket weaving]] is one of the ancient and most-widespread art forms in the Americas. From coiled [[Leymus arenarius|sea lyme grass]] baskets in Nunavut to bark baskets in Tierra del Fuego, Native artists weave baskets from a wide range of materials. Typically baskets are made of vegetable fibers, but Tohono O'odham are known for their horsehair baskets and [[Inupiaq]] artists weave baskets from [[baleen]], filtering plates of certain whales.&lt;ref name=h17&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Traverse Band]] [[Kelly Church]], [[Wasco-Wishram]] Pat Gold, and [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] Joel Queen all weave baskets from copper sheets or wire, and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]-[[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] conceptual artist [[Gail Tremblay]] weaves baskets in the traditional fancywork patterns of her tribes from exposed film. Basketry can take many forms. [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Lisa Telford]] uses cedar bark to weave both traditional functional baskets and impractical but beautiful cedar evening gowns and high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artisttrust.org/node/8696 Lisa Telford.] ''Artist Trust''. Retrieved 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of native grasses provides material for Arctic baskets, as does baleen, which is a 20th-century development. Baleen baskets are typically embellished with walrus ivory carvings.&lt;ref name=h17/&gt; Cedar bark is often used in northwest coastal baskets. Throughout the Great Lakes and northeast, black ash and sweetgrass are woven into fancy work, featuring "porcupine" points, or decorated as strawberries. Bark baskets are traditional for gathering berries. [[Arundinaria|Rivercane]] is the preferred material in the Southeast, and [[Chitimacha]]s are regarded as the finest rivercane weavers. In Oklahoma, rivercane is prized but rare so baskets are typically made of honeysuckle or buckbrush runners. Coiled baskets are popular in the southwest and the Hopi and Apache in particular are known for pictorial coiled basketry plaques. The Tohono O'odham are well known for their basket-weaving prowess, and evidenced by the success of [[Annie Antone]] and [[Terrol Dew Johnson]].

[[File:Kumeyaai basket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kumeyaay]] coiled basket, Celestine Lachapa of Inajo, late 19th century]]California and Great Basin tribes are considered some of the finest basket weavers in the world. [[Juncus]] is a common material in southern California, while sedge, willow, redbud, and devil's claw are also used. [[Pomo]] basket weavers are known to weave 60–100 stitches per inch and their rounded, coiled baskets adorned with quail's topknots, feathers, abalone, and clamshell discs are known as "treasure baskets". Three of the most celebrated Californian basket weavers were [[Elsie Allen]] (Pomo), Laura Somersal ([[Wappo]]), and the late Pomo-[[Patwin]] medicine woman, [[Mabel McKay]],&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; known for her biography, ''Weaving the Dream''. [[Dat So La Lee|Louisa Keyser]] was a highly influential [[Washoe people|Washoe]] basket weaver.

A complex technique called "doubleweave," which involves continuously weaving both an inside and outside surface is shared by the [[Choctaw]], Cherokee, Chitimacha, [[Tarahumara]], and Venezuelan tribes. [[Mike Dart]], [[Cherokee Nation]], is a contemporary practitioner of this technique. The Tarahumara, or Raramuri, of [[Copper Canyon]], Mexico typically weave with pine needles and [[sotol]]. In [[Panama]], [[Embera-Wounaan]] peoples are renowned for their pictoral [[Astrocaryum standleyanum|chunga palm]] baskets, known as ''hösig di'', colored in vivid full-spectrum of [[natural dyes]].

Today basket weaving often leads to environmental activism. Indiscriminate pesticide spraying endangers basket weavers' health. The [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] tree, used by basket weavers from Michigan to Maine, is threatened by the [[emerald ash borer]]. Basket weaver Kelly Church has organized two conferences about the threat and teaches children how to harvest black ash seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Church, Kelly.

===Beadwork===
[[File:Nat Am beadwork sampler.jpg|thumb|left|Examples of contemporary Native American beadwork]]
[[Beadwork]] is a quintessentially Native American art form, but ironically uses beads imported from Europe and Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.

In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes, who quickly applied them to beadwork.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Great Lakes tribes are known for their bandolier bags, that might take an entire year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] perfected contour-style beadwork, in which the lines of beads are stitch to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the [[Dene]] bead lavish floral dog blankets.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Philips, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and [[Innu]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the "double curve."&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Iroquois are also known for "embossed" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief. [[Tammy Rahr]] (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.

[[File:Huichol Trabajando.JPG|thumb|upright|Huichol bead artist, photo by Mario Jareda Beivide]][[Huichol people|Huichol]] Indians of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]], Mexico have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads, one by one, to a surface, such as wood or a gourd, with a mixture of resin and beeswax.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Paul. [http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm The Huichol Web of Life: Creation and Prayer.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518111414/http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm |date=18 May 2008 }} ''The Bead Museum.''. Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. [[Richard Aitson]] ([[Kiowa]]-[[Apache]]) has both an Indian and non-Indian audience for his work and is known for his fully beaded [[cradle board|cradleboards]]. Another Kiowa beadworker, [[Teri Greeves]] has won top honors for her beadwork, which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs, such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Antonio.

Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Amerman]], [[Choctaw]], one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic beaded portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons such as Janet Jackson and Brooke Shields.

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and [[Martha Berry (artist)|Martha Berry]], [[Cherokee]], have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie Okuma ([[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]-[[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]]) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can as small as size 22°, about the size of a grain of salt.&lt;ref&gt;Indyke, Dottie.

Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded dollmakers.

The widespread popularity of glass beads does not mean aboriginal bead making is dead. Perhaps the most famous Native bead is [[wampum]], a cylindrical tube of [[quahog]] or whelk shell. Both shells produce white beads, but only parts of the quahog produce purple. These are ceremonially and politically important to a range of [[Northeastern Woodland tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth James Perry ([[Aquinnah Wampanoag]]-[[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) creates wampum jewelry today, including wampum belts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elizabethjamesperry.com/ Original Wampum Art.] ''Elizabeth James Perry.'' 2008.

[[Eastern Band Cherokee]]s' pottery has Catawba influences.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, 158&lt;/ref&gt; In Oklahoma, Cherokees lost their pottery traditions until revived by Anna Belle Sixkiller Mitchell. The [[Caddo]] tribe's centuries-long pottery tradition had died out in the early 20th century, but has been effectively revived by [[Jereldine Redcorn]].

Pueblo people are particularly known for their ceramic traditions. [[Nampeyo]] (c. 1860 – 1942) was a [[Hopi]] potter who collaborated with anthropologists to revive traditional pottery forms and designs, and many of her relatives are successful potters today. [[Maria Martinez|Maria]] and [[Julian Martinez]], both [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] revived their tribe's blackware tradition in the early 20th century. Julian invented a gloss-matte blackware style for which his tribe is still known today. [[Lucy M. Lewis|Lucy Lewis]] (1898–1992) of [[Acoma Pueblo]] gained recognition for her black-on-white ceramics in the mid-20th century. [[Cochiti Pueblo]] was known for its grotesque figurines at the turn-of-the-20th century, and these have been revived by Virgil Ortiz. Cochiti potter [[Helen Cordero]] (1915–1994) invented [[storyteller figure]]s, which feature a large, single figure of a seated [[American Indian elder|elder]] telling stories to groups of smaller figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artssouthwest.com/pottery/HelenCorderobio.html Helen Cordero.] ''Arts of the Southwest.''.

Today contemporary Native potters create a wide range of ceramics from functional pottery to monumental ceramic sculpture. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] of [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] is one of the leading ceramic artists in the Americas. She creates coil-built, emotionally charged figures that comment on contemporary society. [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]], also of Santa Clara Pueblo is world-renowned for her individual figures as well as conceptual installations featuring ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/peterson/Naranjo.html Nora Naranjo-Morse.] ''Women Artists of the American West.''.

===Performance art===
[[File:Wayne gaussoin performance.jpg|thumb|Performance art by Wayne Gaussoin ([[Picuris]]), [[Museum of Contemporary Native Art]]]]
[[Performance art]] is a new art form, emerging in the 1960s, and so does not carry the cultural baggage of many other art genres. Performance art can draw upon storytelling traditions, as well as music and dance, and often includes elements of installation, video, film, and textile design. [[Rebecca Belmore]], a Canadian [[Ojibway]] performance artist, has represented her country in the prestigious [[Venice Biennale]]. [[James Luna]], a [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]-[[Mexican people|Mexican]] performance artist, also participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

Performance allows artists to confront their audience directly, challenge long held stereotypes, and bring up current issues, often in an emotionally charged manner. "[P]eople just howl in their seats, and there's ranting and booing or hissing, carrying on the in the audience," says Rebecca Belmore of the response to her work.&lt;ref name="trick"&gt;Ryan, 146&lt;/ref&gt; She has created performances to call attention to violence against and many unsolved murders of First Nations women. Both Belmore and Luna create elaborate, often outlandish outfits and props for their performances and move through a range of characters. For instance, a repeating character of Luna's is Uncle Jimmy,&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; a disabled veteran who criticizes greed and apathy on his reservation.

On the other hand, [[Marcus Amerman]], a [[Choctaw]] performance artist, maintains a consistent role of the Buffalo Man, whose irony and social commentary arise from the odd situations in which he finds himself, for instance a James Bond movie or lost in a desert labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcusamerman.com/creations/performance.html Performance.] ''Marcus Amerman.''.

A [[Bolivia]]n [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] cooperative, [[Mujeres Creando]] or "Women Creating" features many indigenous artists. They create public performances or [[street theater]] to bring attention to issues of women's, indigenous people's, and lesbian's rights, as well as anti-poverty issues. Julieta Paredes, [[María Galindo]] and Mónica Mendoza are founding members.

Performance art has allowed Native Americans access to the international art world, and Rebecca Belmore mentions that her audiences are non-Native;&lt;ref name="trick"/&gt; however, Native American audiences also respond to this genre. ''Bringing It All Back Home,'' a 1997 film collaboration between James Luna and [[Chris Eyre]], documents Luna's first performance at his own home, the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Luna describes the experience as "probably the scariest moment of my life as an artist ... performing for the members of my reservation in the tribal hall."&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Their early photographs stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of Edward Curtis and other contemporaries. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren (Tsimshian/Tlingit) on the photographs of B.A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having Anglo-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and traditional ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |title=Mique'l Askren, Bringing our History into Focus: Re-Developing the Work of B.A. Haldane, 19th-century Tsimshian Photographer, ''Blackflash: Seeing Red'', Volume 24, No. 3, 2007, pp. 41-47 |access-date=13 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306171344/http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Martín Chambi]] (1891–1973), a Quechua photographer from Peru, was one of the pioneering indigenous photographers of South America. [[Peter Pitseolak]] (1902–1973), [[Inuit]] from [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]], documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps. [[Horace Poolaw]] (1906–1984), [[Kiowa]], shot over 2000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward. [[Jean Fredericks]] (born 1906), [[Hopi]], had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today innumerable Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Seminole]], has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at [[UC Davis]] featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.'' Native photographers have taken their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.

===Printmaking===
Although it is widely speculated that the ancient [[Adena culture|Adena]] stone tablets were used for printmaking, not much is known about aboriginal American [[printmaking]]. 20th-century Native artists have borrowed techniques from Japan and Europe, such as [[woodcut]], [[linocut]], [[serigraphy]], [[monotyping]], and other practices.

Printmaking has flourished among [[Inuit]] communities in particular. European-Canadian [[James Archibald Houston|James Houston]] created a graphic art program in [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Houston taught local Inuit stone carvers how to create prints from stone-blocks and stencils. He asked local artists to draw pictures and the shop generated limited edition prints, based on the [[ukiyo-e]] workshop system of Japan. Cooperative print shops were also established in nearby communities, including [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]], [[Puvirnituq, Quebec|Puvirnituq]], [[Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|Holman]], and [[Pangnirtung]]. These shops have experimented with [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[lithography]], and silkscreen. Shops produced annual catalogs advertising their collections. Local birds and animals, spirit beings, and hunting scenes are the most popular subject matter,&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; but are allegorical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Backgrounds tend to be minimal and perspective is mixed.&lt;ref name=h50&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent of Cape Dorset artists is [[Kenojuak Ashevak]] (born 1927), who has received many public commissions and two honorary doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name=h50/&gt; Other prominent Inuit printmakers and graphic artists include [[Parr (artist)|Parr]], [[Osuitok Ipeelee]], [[Germaine Arnaktauyok]], [[Pitseolak Ashoona]], [[Tivi Etok]], [[Helen Kalvak]], [[Jessie Oonark]], [[Kananginak Pootoogook]], [[Pudlo Pudlat]], [[Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq]], and [[Simon Tookoome]]. Inuit printmaker [[Andrew Qappik]] designed the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]].

Many Native painters transformed their paintings into fine art prints. [[Potawatomi]] artist [[Woody Crumbo]] created bold, screen prints and etchings in the mid-20th century that blended traditional, flat [[Bacone College|Bacone Style]] with [[Art Deco]] influences. [[Kiowa]]-[[Caddo]]-[[Choctaw]] painter, [[T.C. Cannon]] traveled to Japan to study wood block printing from master printers.

In Chile, [[Mapuche]] printmaker [[Santos Chávez]] (1934–2001) was one of the most celebrated artists of his country – with over 85 solo exhibitions during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oll.state.oh.us/multimedia/programs/person.cfm?person_id=107528&amp;program_id=15 Jose Santos Chavez.] ''The Ohio Channel Media Center.''.

===Sculpture===

Native Americans have created sculpture, both monumental and small, for millennia. Stone sculptures are ubiquitous through the Americas, in the forms of [[stelae]], [[inuksuit]], and statues. Alabaster stone carving is popular among Western tribes, where [[catlinite]] carving is traditional in the Northern Plains and [[Zuni fetish|fetish]]-carving is traditional in the Southwest, particularly among the [[Zuni people|Zuni]]. The [[Taíno people|Taíno]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] are known for their [[zemi]]s– sacred, three-pointed stone sculptures.

[[Inuit art]]ists sculpt with walrus ivory, caribou antlers, bones, soapstone, serpentinite, and argillite. They often represent local fauna and humans engaged in hunting or ceremonial activities.

Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. [[Allan Houser]] ([[Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache]]) became one of the most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]]. His two sons, Phillip and [[Bob Haozous]] are sculptors today. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving – most famously their monumental [[totem pole]]s that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, [[Mungo Martin]], [[Ellen Neel]], and [[Willie Seaweed]] kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include [[Charles Edenshaw]], [[Bill Reid]], and [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]]. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with [[Haida Argillite Carvings|argillite]]. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as [[Preston Singletary]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]), [[Susan Point]] ([[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]) and Marvin Oliver ([[Quinault people|Quinault]]/[[Isleta Pueblo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tall Chief, Russ.

Retrieved 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Southeast, woodcarving dominates sculpture. [[Willard Stone]], of Cherokee descent, exhibited internationally in the mid-20th century. [[Amanda Crowe]] ([[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) studied sculpture at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and returned to her reservation to teach over 2000 students woodcarving over a period of 40 years, ensuring that sculpture thrives as an art form on the Qualla Boundary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokeeheritagetrails.org/elderart/eld05.html Amanda Crowe.] ''Cherokee Heritage Trails.'' 2003.

''Art of the Andes'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicuñas have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] culture today. Coroma in [[Antonio Quijarro Province]], [[Bolivia]] is a major center for ceremonial textile production.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group..."&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KunaWomanWithMolas.jpg|thumb|left|Kuna woman with molas, [[San Blas Islands]], [[Panama]].]]
[[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] tribal members of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] are famous for their [[Mola (art form)|mola]]s, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse [[appliqué]] technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including [[pop culture]]. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can disassemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panart.com/molainfo.htm About Molas.] ''Indigenous Art from Panamá.''. Retrieved 28 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as ''[[huipil]]s'' or traditional blouses. Elaborate [[Maya textiles]] featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Geise, Paula.

Retrieved 28 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.

[[Seminole]] seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Blackard, David M. and Patsy West. [http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml Seminole Clothing: Colorful Patchwork.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316140336/http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml |date=16 March 2008 }} ''Seminole Tribe of Florida.''.

Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their [[ribbonwork]], found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. [[Powwow]] and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their [[Fingerweaving|fingerwoven]] sashes.

[[Pueblo]] men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.

[[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|left|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], c. 1980s]]
[[Navajo rug]]s are woven by Navajo women today from [[Navajo-Churro sheep]] or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th-century Navajo weavers include [[Clara Sherman]] and [[Hosteen Klah]], who co-founded the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]].

In 1973, the Navajo Studies Department of the [[Diné College]] in [[Many Farms, Arizona]], wanted to determine how long it took a [[Navajo weaving|Navajo weaver]] to create a rug or blanket from [[sheep shearing]] to market. The study determined the total amount of time was 345 hours. Out of these 345 hours, the expert Navajo weaver needed: 45 hours to shear the sheep and process the wool; 24 hours to [[spinning (textiles)|spin]] the [[wool]]; 60 hours to prepare the [[dye]] and to dye the wool; 215 hours to [[weaving|weave]] the piece; and only one hour to sell the item in their shop.&lt;ref&gt;http://nativeamerican-art.com/navajo-blankets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. [[Chilkat weaving]] and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear [[formline designs]]. [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] weaver [[Jennie Thlunaut]] (1982–1986) was instrumental in this revival.

Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf ([[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]), whose work is overtly political in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Rachel.

==Cultural sensitivity and repatriation==
As in most cultures, Native peoples create some works that are to be used only in sacred, private ceremonies. Many sacred objects or items that contain medicine are to be seen or touched by certain individuals with specialized knowledge. Many [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] and [[Hopi]] [[kachina|katsina]] figures (''tihü'' in [[Hopi language|Hopi]] and ''kokko'' in [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) and katsinam regalia are not meant to be seen by individuals who have not received instruction about that particular katsina. Many institutions do not display these publicly out of respect for tribal taboos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sarweb.org/?resources_katsinam "Katsinam from the IARC Collection."] ''School for Advanced Research.''.

[[Navajo sandpainting]] is a component for healing ceremonies, but sandpaintings can be made into permanent art that is acceptable to sell to non-Natives as long as Holy People are not portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalinks.com/navajos.html "Sand Painting."] ''Crystal Links: Navajo Nation.''. Retrieved 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Various tribes prohibit photography of many sacred ceremonies, as used to be the case in many Western cultures.  As several early photographers broke local laws, photographs of sensitive ceremonies are in circulation, but tribes prefer that they not be displayed. The same can be said for photographs or sketches of medicine bundle contents.

Two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders sued a museum, trying to remove a [[False Face Society mask]] or ''Ga:goh:sah'' from an exhibit because "it was a medicine object intended to be seen only by community members and that its public display would cause irreparable harm to the Mohawk."&lt;ref name=phil&gt;Phillips 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]] has ruled that such masks are not for sale or public display,&lt;ref name=false/&gt; nor are Corn Husk Society masks.&lt;ref name=corn/&gt;

Tribes and individuals within tribes do not always agree about what is or is not appropriate to display to the public. Many institutions do not exhibit [[Ghost Dance]] regalia. At the request of tribal leaders, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] is among those that does not exhibit Plains warrior's shields or "artifacts imbued with a warrior's power".&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Lee.

==Museum representation==
Indigenous American arts have had a long and complicated relationship with museum representation since the early 1900s. In 1931, ''The Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts'' was the first large scale show that held Indigenous art on display. Their portrayal in museums grew more common later in the 1900s as a reaction to the Civil Rights Movement. With the rising trend of representation in the political atmosphere, minority voices gained more representation in museums as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlo|first1=Janet Catherine|title=The Art of Indigenous Americans and American Art History: A Century of Exhibitions|journal=Perspective|date=5 December 2015|issue=2|doi=10.4000/perspective.6004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Indigenous art was being displayed, the curatorial choices on how to display their work were not always made with the best of intentions. For instance, Native American art pieces and artifacts would often be shown alongside dinosaur bones, implying that they are a people of the past and non-existent or irrelevant in today's world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abu Hadal|first1=Katherine|title=Why Native American Art Doesn’t Belong in the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/why-native-american-art-doesnt-belong-in-the-american-museum-of-natural-history/|website=Indian Country Today|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American remains were on display in museums up until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Duane H.|title=Exhibiting Culture: American Indians and Museums|journal=Tulsa Law Review|date=2009|volume=45|issue=1|pages=25–32|url=http://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/tlr/vol45/iss1/3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many did not yet view Native American art as a part of the mainstream as of the year 1992, there has since then been a great increase in volume and quality of both Native art and artists, as well as exhibitions and venues, and individual curators. Such leaders as the director of the National Museum of the American Indian insist that Native American representation be done from a first-hand perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, Joshua. “A New Dawn for Museums of Native American Art.” ''The New York Times'', 20 Aug. 2005, www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/arts/design/a-new-dawn-for-museums-of-native-american-art.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of such museums as the [[Heard Museum]] and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], both of which trained spotlights specifically upon Native American arts, enabled a great number of Native artists to display and develop their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ash-Milby|first1=Kathleen|last2=Phillips|first2=Ruth B.|title=Inclusivity or Sovereignty? Native American Arts in the Gallery and the Museum since 1992|journal=Art Journal|date=12 October 2017|volume=76|issue=2|pages=10–38|doi=10.1080/00043249.2017.1367190}}&lt;/ref&gt; For five months starting in October 2017, three Native American works of art selected from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection to be exhibited in the American Wing at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Yount, Sylvia. “Redefining American Art: Native American Art in The American Wing.” ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art, I.e. The Met Museum'', 21 Feb. 2017, www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2017/native-american-art-the-american-wing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum representation for Indigenous artists calls for great responsibility from curators and museum institutions. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 enacted by George H.W. Bush prohibits non-Indigenous artists from selling art based upon Native American culture. This law has brought to light ideas regarding representation and affected artists’ reputations such as that of Jimmie Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Dear Unsuspecting Public, Jimmie Durham Is a Trickster.” ''Indian Country Media Network'', 26 June 2017, indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/dear-unsuspecting-public-jimmie-durham-trickster/.&lt;/ref&gt; Durham creates art based around Indigenous culture, representation, and identity. Despite not being officially enrolled as a Cherokee citizen, he has claimed to be of Cherokee descent, due in part to his participation in the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM). Ultimately, artists like Durham bring up debates regarding what representation is, who it is for, if artists can represent other cultures (and if so, how?), and what the limits of identity are.&lt;ref&gt;Schmelzer, Paul. “How Can Contemporary Art Be More Inclusive of Native Voices?” ''Walker Art Center'', 12 Oct. 2017, walkerart.org/magazine/inclusion-native-american-art-panel-discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and curators work in sync with these topics, discussing who to represent, why are they being chosen, what Indigenous Art looks like, and what its purpose is. Together, they shape the narrative of Indigenous culture in a meaningful way. Museums, as educational institutions, give light to cultures and narratives that would otherwise go unseen; they provide a necessary spotlight and who they choose to represent is pivotal to the history of the represented artists and culture.
