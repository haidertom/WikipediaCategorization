'''AquaMaps''' is a collaborative project with the aim of producing computer-generated (and ultimately, expert reviewed) predicted global distribution maps for [[Marine biology|marine species]] on a 0.5 x 0.5 degree [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] of the [[ocean]]s based on data available through online species databases such as [[FishBase]] and [[SeaLifeBase]] and species occurrence records from [[OBIS]] or [[GBIF]] and using an environmental envelope model (see [[niche modelling]]) in conjunction with expert input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/ |title=AquaMaps Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/main/FB_Book_KReyes_AquaMaps_JG.pdf |author=Kesner-Reyes, K. |author2=K.

World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, version (04/2012) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying model represents a modified version of the relative environmental suitability (RES) model developed by Kristin Kaschner to generate global predictions of marine mammal occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/data/bio1/kaschner/pdf/2006-meps.pdf |author=Kaschner, K. |author2=R.

According to the AquaMaps website on August 2013, the project held standardized distribution maps for over 17,300 species of [[fish]]es, [[marine mammal]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
The project is also expanding to incorporate [[Freshwater biology|freshwater]] species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/main/home_fw.php |title=Freshwater Biodiversity AquaMaps}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 600 biodiversity maps for freshwater fishes of the Americas available as at November 2009. AquaMaps predictions have been validated successfully for a number of species using independent data sets and the model was shown to perform equally well or better than other standard species distribution models, when faced with the currently existing suboptimal input data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VBS-4XSCVHM-1&amp;_user=1634520&amp;_coverDate=02%2F10%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1191986225&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000054038&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1634520&amp;md5=01b6538e209644aaa13ac85d8b10f56f |author= Ready, J. |author2= K.

In addition to displaying individual maps per species, AquaMaps provides tools to generate species richness maps by higher taxon, plus a spatial search for all species overlapping a specified grid square. There is also the facility to create custom maps for any species via the web by modifying the input parameters and re-running the map generating algorithm in real time, and a variety of other tools including the investigation of effects of climate change on species distributions (see relevant section of the [http://www.aquamaps.org/ AquaMaps search page]).

== Coordination ==
The project is coordinated by Dr Rainer Froese of [http://www.ifm-geomar.de/ IFM-GEOMAR] and involves contributions from other research institutes including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090430/http://www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/data/bio1/kaschner/index.html Evolutionary Biology and Ecology Lab, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg], [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC), the [http://www.nrm.se/en/frontpage.16_en.html Swedish Museum of Natural History] (NRM - Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet), the [[WorldFish Center]] in Malaysia, and [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]] in Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9982">'''Bayesian experimental design''' provides a general probability-theoretical framework from which other theories on [[Design of experiments|experimental design]] can be derived. It is based on [[Bayesian inference]] to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.

The theory of Bayesian experimental design is to a certain extent based on the theory for making [[optimal decision|optimal decisions under uncertainty]]. The aim when designing an experiment is to  maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. The utility is most commonly defined in terms of a measure of the accuracy of the information provided by the experiment (e.g. the [[Shannon information]] or the negative [[variance]]), but may also involve factors such as the financial cost of performing the experiment. What will be the optimal experiment design depends on the particular utility criterion chosen.

==Relations to more specialized optimal design theory==

===Linear theory===
If the model is linear, the prior [[probability density function]] (PDF) is homogeneous and observational errors are [[Multivariate normal distribution|normally distributed]], the theory simplifies to the classical [[optimal design|optimal experimental design theory]].

===Approximate normality===
In numerous publications on Bayesian experimental design, it is (often implicitly) assumed that all posterior PDFs will be approximately normal. This allows for the expected utility to be calculated using linear theory, averaging over the space of model parameters, an approach reviewed in {{Harvtxt|Chaloner|Verdinelli|1995}}. Caution must however be taken when applying this method, since approximate normality of all possible posteriors is difficult to verify, even in cases of normal observational errors and uniform prior PDF.

===Posterior distribution===
Recently, increased computational resources allow inference of the [[posterior distribution]] of model parameters, which can directly be used for experiment design. {{Harvtxt|Vanlier|Tiemann|Hilbers|van Riel|2012}} proposed an approach that uses the [[posterior predictive distribution]] to assess the effect of new measurements on prediction uncertainty, while {{Harvtxt|Liepe|Filippi|Komorowski|Stumpf|2013}} suggest maximizing the mutual information between parameters, predictions and potential new experiments.

Given a vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of parameters to determine, a [[Prior probability|prior PDF]] &lt;math&gt;p(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; over those parameters and a PDF &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\theta,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; for making observation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, given parameter values &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and an experiment design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, the posterior PDF can be calculated using [[Bayes' theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y, \xi) = \frac{p(y \mid \theta, \xi) p(\theta)}{p(y \mid \xi)}  \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is the marginal probability density in observation space
:&lt;math&gt;p(y\mid\xi) = \int p(\theta)p(y\mid\theta,\xi)\,d\theta \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The expected utility of an experiment with design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; can then be defined
:&lt;math&gt;U(\xi)=\int p(y\mid\xi)U(y,\xi)\,dy,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U(y,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is some real-valued functional of the [[Posterior probability|posterior PDF]] &lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y, \xi)&lt;/math&gt; after making observation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; using an experiment design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gain in Shannon information as utility===

Utility may be defined as the prior-posterior gain in [[Differential entropy|Shannon information]]
:&lt;math&gt; U(y, \xi) = \int \log(p(\theta \mid y, \xi))\,p(\theta | y, \xi) \, d\theta - \int \log(p(\theta))\,p(\theta)\,d\theta \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Another possibility is to define the utility as
:&lt;math&gt;U(y, \xi) = D_{KL}(p(\theta\mid y,\xi) \| p(\theta)) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] of the prior from the posterior distribution.
{{Harvtxt|Lindley|1956}} noted that the expected utility will then be coordinate-independent and can be written in two forms
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
 U(\xi) &amp; = \int \int \log(p(\theta \mid y,\xi))\,p(\theta, y \mid \xi) \, d\theta\,dy - \int\log(p(\theta))\,p(\theta) \, d\theta \\
      &amp; = \int \int \log(p(y \mid \theta,\xi))\,p(\theta, y \mid \xi)\,dy\,d\theta - \int\log(p(y \mid \xi))\,p(y\mid \xi) \, dy,
\end{alignat}
\, &lt;/math&gt;

of which the latter can be evaluated without the need for evaluating individual posterior PDFs
&lt;math&gt;p(\theta \mid y,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; for all possible observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the first term on the second equation line will not depend on the design &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, as long as the observational uncertainty doesn't. On the other hand, the integral of &lt;math&gt;p(\theta) \log p(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in the first form is constant for all &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, so if the goal is to choose the design with the highest utility, the term need not be computed at all. Several authors have considered numerical techniques for evaluating and optimizing this criterion, e.g. {{Harvtxt|van den Berg|Curtis|Trampert|2003}} and {{Harvtxt|Ryan|2003}}.  Note that
:&lt;math&gt;U(\xi) = I(\theta;y)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
the expected '''information gain''' being exactly the '''[[mutual information]]'''  between the parameter ''θ'' and the observation ''y''.  {{Harvtxt|Kelly|1956}} also derived just such a utility function for a gambler seeking to [[Kelly criterion|profit maximally]] from [[Gambling and information theory|side information in a horse race]]; Kelly's situation is identical to the foregoing, with the side information, or "private wire" taking the place of the experiment.

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

The '''Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|d}}), often referred to as the '''Broad Institute''', is a biomedical and [[genomic]] research center located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The institute is independently governed and supported as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Report for BROAD INSTITUTE INC.|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/26-3428781/broad-institute.aspx|website=GuideStar.org|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute-MIT &amp; Harvard|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmn4bcl/broad-institute-mit-harvard|publisher=Manta Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is partners with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], and the five Harvard [[teaching hospitals]].

== History ==

The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Broad Institute created: Links Harvard, M.I.T., and others in interdisciplinary initiative in genomics and medicine
|url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/07.17/11-broad.html
|publisher = Harvard Gazette
|date = 2003-07-17
|accessdate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of [[Whitehead Institute]] at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the [[Human Genome Project]]. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002–2003 among philanthropists [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edythe Broad]], MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]).

The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''C-QUAM''' is the method of [[AM stereo]] broadcasting used in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and most other countries. It was invented in 1977 by Norman Parker, Francis Hilbert, and Yoshio Sakaie, and [[publish]]ed in an [[IEEE]] [[Academic journal|journal]].

Using [[circuitry]] developed by [[Motorola]], C-QUAM uses [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM) to [[Code|encode]] the stereo separation [[signal (computing)|signal]].  This extra signal is then stripped down in such a way that it is compatible with the [[envelope detector]] of older receivers (hence the name C-QUAM, i.e. Compatible QUadrature Amplitude Modulation).  A 25 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[pilot tone]] is added to trigger [[receiver (radio)|receivers]]; it is not necessary for the reconstruction of the original audio sources.

== How it works ==
The C-QUAM signal is composed of two distinct modulation stages: a conventional AM version and a compatible quadrature PM version.

Stage 1 provides the transmitter with a summed L+R mono audio input. This input is precisely the same as conventional AM-Mono transmission methods and ensures 100% compatibility with conventional 'envelope detector' receivers.

Stage 2 provides the stereo mixed audio input and replaces the conventional crystal oscillator stage of otherwise AM-Mono transmitters. So as to not create interference with 'envelope detector' receivers, the stage 2 signal takes the mixed audio signals and phase modulates both, using a divide-by-4 Johnson counter and two balanced modulators operating 90 degrees out of phase with each other.  Stage 2 is not amplitude modulated, it is phase modulated, and is made up of both a L+R input and a L-R input. 

To recover the 'stereo' audio signals, a [[synchronous detector]] extracts the L-R audio from the phase modulated quadrature portion of the signal created in stage 2. The L+R audio can be extracted from either the AM (stage 1) or the PM (stage 2) modulation component. From there, the audio can be readily de-muxed back to 'stereo', a.k.a. Left and Right channels.

== Known problems ==

C-QUAM is not perfect, however, in large part because pre-[[AMAX]] it exhibited [[platform motion]], with the audio "center" rocking back and forth as if changing the balance knob.  This effect is potentially bothersome, especially in a moving vehicle where the received signal changes rapidly, and occupants (particularly the driver) would be more prone to its effects (this was an effect that happened primarily with skywave signals. Groundwave or local coverage usually did not suffer from this issue).  This has been alleviated in subsequent revisions.  Also, since some stereo information is contained in the [[sideband]]s, [[adjacent channel interference]] can cause problems.  Finally, when only part of a sideband is attenuated (as often happens to [[skywave]] signals reflecting off the [[ionosphere]]), an effect known as [[selective fading]], very unpleasant effects result; hence, the C-QUAM system is not often if ever used for [[shortwave]] broadcasting, nor by stations which receive a great deal of skywave interference.

== User base ==
{{As of|2014|03}}, there are still a number of AM radio stations in North America broadcasting in C-QUAM stereo. Among those stations are [[WXYG]]/540: Sauk Rapids, MN; [[CFCB]]/570: Corner Brook, NL; [[CFCO]]/630: Chatham, Ontario (covering SW Ontario, Eastern Michigan and Northern Ohio); [[WLS (AM)|WLS]]/890 (now during both day and night hours): [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[WNMB]]/900: [[North Myrtle Beach|North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]; [[WBLQ (AM)|WBLQ]]/1230: [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]], [[Rhode Island]]; [[WIRY (AM)|WIRY]]/1340: Plattsburgh, New York; [[WAXB]]/850: Ridgefield, Connecticut; and [[WLAD]]/800: Danbury, Connecticut.  In addition to FCC-Licensed C-QUAM AM broadcast stations, low-powered (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;mW) [[Part 15]] C-QUAM stereo transmitters are available for sale for use in the United States.

== Competition from IBOC Hybrid Digital Systems ==

While C-QUAM is an accepted international standard for AM Radio broadcasting, it is [[:wikt:incompatible|incompatible]] with the [[IBOC]] (In-band on-channel) "HD" (Hybrid Digital) radio system, so a broadcaster must choose what system they will use.  The IBOC system allows transmission of an audio frequency range extending to approximately 15&amp;nbsp;kHz, 2-ch Stereo on the AM band, but with significant digital artifact and aliasing due to substantial codec inadequacy.

In addition, C-QUAM patents have expired.  [[iBiquity]] still controls IBOC intellectual property through patents, through licensing fees for both the use of the technology, and any modifications to be made, even if the broadcaster in question has purchased the equipment outright and made costly modifications to their transmitter plant in order to implement it.

Very few {{Cn|date=May 2013}} AM radio stations that broadcast with IBOC [[HD Radio]] during the day switch to C-QUAM AM Stereo during nighttime operation to reduce sideband digital (hash) interference and to provide long-range stereo reception. Many HD radio tuners have a limited ability to decode C-Quam stereo transmissions, (typically with lower bandwidth), and as a result, reduced audio quality than what could be expected from a specifically designed AMAX/C-QUAM only tuner. C-QUAM AM Stereo transmissions have the same range as AM Monural transmission, a key benefit.

Whereas many stations in the late 2000s changed from C-QUAM to HD Radio, in the 2010s the trend reversed with may HD Radio stations shutting off their digital equipment. However, few of these stations returned to C-QUAM broadcasts.

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

=== Circus clown ===
{{further information|Circus clown}}

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Peter Berger writes that "It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society".&lt;ref name="BergerP78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name="CalleryP64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">[[Fred Lerdahl]]'s '''"Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems"''' cites [[Pierre Boulez]]'s ''[[Le Marteau sans Maître]]'' (1955) as an example of "a huge gap between compositional system and cognized result," though he "could have illustrated just as well with works by [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], or [[Iannis Xenakis]]". (In [[semiology|semiological]] terms, this is a gap between the [[esthesic and poietic]] processes.) To explain this gap, and in hopes of bridging it, Lerdahl proposes the concept of a [[musical grammar]], "a limited set of rules that can generate indefinitely large sets of musical events and/or their structural descriptions." He divides this further into compositional grammar and listening grammar, the latter being one "more or less unconsciously employed by auditors, that generates mental representations of the music". He divides the former into natural and artificial compositional grammars. While the two have historically been fruitfully mixed, a natural grammar arises spontaneously in a culture while an artificial one is a conscious invention of an individual or group in a culture; the gap can arise only between listening grammar and artificial grammars. To begin to understand the listening grammar Lerdahl and [[Ray Jackendoff]] created a theory of musical cognition, ''[[Generative theory of tonal music|A Generative Theory of Tonal Music]]'' (1983; {{ISBN|0-262-62107-X}}). That theory is outlined in the essay. Lerdahl's constraints on artificial compositional grammars are:

==Constraints on event sequences==

*''Constraint 1'': The musical surface must be capable of being parsed into a sequence of discrete events.
**[counterexample: Ligeti, computer music]
*''Constraint 2'': The musical surface must be available for [[hierarchical]] structuring by the listening grammar.
**[through grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction, and prolongational reduction. "Associational" factors such as [[Motif (music)|motivic]] development and [[timbre|timbral]] relations are ignored, but for "Timbral Hierarchies" see Lerdahl 1987]
*''Constraint 3'': The establishment of local grouping boundaries requires the presence of salient distinctive transitions at the musical surface.
**[counterexample: [[minimal music]]]
*''Constraint 4'': Projections of groups, especially at larger levels, depends on [[symmetry]] and on the establishment of musical [[parallelism (music)|parallelism]]s.
*''Constraint 5'': The establishment of a [[Metre (poetry)|metrical structure]] requires a degree of regularity in the placement of [[Stress (linguistics)|phenomenal accent]]s.
*''Constraint 6'': A complex time-span segmentation depends on the projection of complex grouping and metrical structures.
*''Constraint 7'': The projection of a time-span tree depends on a complex time-span segmentation in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.
*''Constraint 8'': The projection of a prolongational tree depends on a corresponding time-span tree in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.

==Constraints on underlying materials==

*''Constraint 9'': Stability conditions must operate on a fixed collection of elements.
**[usually pitches or rather fundamentals with harmonic partials]
*''Constraint 10'': [[Interval (music)|Intervals]] between elements of a collection arranged along a scale should fall within a certain range of magnitude.
*''Constraint 11'': A [[pitch (music)|pitch]] collection should recur at the [[octave]] to produce [[pitch class]]es.
**[ [[octave equivalency]] ]
*''Constraint 12'': There must be a strong [[psychoacoustic]] basis for stability conditions. For pitch collections, that requires intervals that proceed gradually from very small to comparatively large frequency [[ratio]]s.
**[ [[just intonation]] ]
*''Constraint 13'': Division of the octave into equal parts facilitates [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and reduces memory load.
**[ [[equal temperament]] ]
*''Constraint 14'': Assume pitch sets of ''n''-fold equal divisions of the octave. Then subsets that satisfy uniqueness, coherence, and simplicity will facilitate location within the overall pitch space.
**[only certain divisions of the octave, 12 and 20 included, allow uniqueness, coherence, and transpositional simplicity, and only the diatonic and pentatonic subsets of the 12-tone chromatic set follow these constraints (Balzano, 1980, 1982)]

==Pitch space==

*''Constraint 15'': Any but the most primitive stability conditions must be susceptible to multidimensional representation, where spatial distance correlates with cognitive distance.
*''Constraint 16'': Levels of pitch space must be sufficiently available from musical surfaces to be internalized.
*''Constraint 17'': A reductionally organized pitch space is needed to express the [[steps and skips]] by which cognitive distance is measured and to express degrees of melodic completeness.
**[completedness resembles implication-realization theory (Meyer, 1973 and Narmour, 1977), the ''Zug'', ''[[Urlinie]]'', and ''[[Bassbrechung]]'' (Schenker).]

He concludes, "Some of these constraints seem to me binding, others optional. Constraints 9-12 are essential for the very existence of stability conditions. Constraints 13-17, on the other hand, can be variously jettisoned." Examples given are [[Carnatic music|South Indian music]], which doesn't [[modulation (music)|modulate]] and isn't equally tempered (13 &amp; 14), and music such as that of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], and others who "have developed consonance-dissonance patterns directly from the [[total chromatic]]" (14-17).

==Comprehensibility and value==

*''Aesthetic Claim 1'': The best music utilizes the full potential of our cognitive resources.
*''Aesthetic Claim 2'': The best music arises from an alliance of a compositional grammar with the listening grammar.

To these ends he proposes the use of the terms "[[complexity]]" and "complicatedness", complexity being hierarchical structural richness, and complicatedness being "numerous non-redundant events per unit time." On Lerdahl's view complexity has aesthetic value, while complicatedness is neutral. He writes, "All sorts of music satisfy these criteria — for example, Indian [[raga]], Japanese [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[jazz]], and most Western [[art music]]. [[Rock music]] fails on grounds of insufficient complexity. Much [[contemporary music]] pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity. In short, these criteria allow for infinite variety but only along certain lines."

"I find this conclusion both exciting and — initially at least — alarming...the constraints are tighter than I bargained for."

"My second aesthetic claim in effect rejects this ["progressivist"] attitude in favor of the older view that music-making should be based on "nature". For the ancients, nature may have resided in the music of the spheres, but for us it lies in the musical mind."

'''Colleen Cavanaugh''' is an American academic [[microbiologist]] best known for her studies of [[hydrothermal vent]] [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaines|first1=Susan|last2=Eglington|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Rullkotter|first3=Jurgen|title=Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History|date=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195176193|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, she is the Edward C. Jeffrey Professor of [[Biology]] in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [[Harvard University]] and is affiliated with the [[Rowland Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colleen Cavanaugh|url=http://cavanaughlab.oeb.harvard.edu/people/colleen-cavanaugh|website=Cavanaugh Lab|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh was the first to propose that the deep-sea [[giant tube worm]], ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'', obtains its food from [[bacteria]] living within its [[Cell (biology)|cells]], an insight which she had as a [[graduate student]] at Harvard.&lt;ref name="tenure"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cromie |first1=William |title=Microbiologist-Aquanaut Colleen Cavanaugh Receives Tenure |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/11.14/Microbiologist-.html |accessdate=15 September 2016 |publisher=The Harvard University Gazette |date=November 14, 1996 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234707/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/11.14/Microbiologist-.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, she made the connection that these [[chemoautotroph]]ic bacteria were able to play this role through their use of [[chemosynthesis]], the biological oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., [[hydrogen sulfide]]) to synthesize organic matter from very simple carbon-containing molecules, thus allowing [[organism]]s such as the bacteria (and dependent organisms such as tube worms) to exist in [[ocean floor|deep ocean]] without [[sunlight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirchman|first1=David|title=Processes in Microbial Ecology|date=2012|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199586936|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cavanaugh was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=J. |title=Colleen Cavanaugh: Winner of the Ecology Institute's IRPE PRIZE 1986 in marine ecology |journal=[[Marine Ecology Progress Series]] |date=November 27, 1986 |volume=34 |issue=9–10 |doi=10.3354/meps034009 |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/34/m034p009.pdf |accessdate=15 September 2016|bibcode=1986MEPS...34....9G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavanaugh received her undergraduate degree from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1977, where she initially studied music but ultimately majored in ecology.&lt;ref name="kunzig"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kunzig |first1=R. |title=Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science |date=2000 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |isbn=9780393320633 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says her life changed direction in her sophomore year when she heard about a course in [[marine ecology]] at the [[oceanography|oceanographic]] center in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]]. There, her work involved wading out into chilly waters to study the [[sexual reproduction|mating habit]]s of [[horseshoe crab]]s, and she described herself as "[falling] in love" with the relaxed camaraderie and exchange of ideas between biologists, [[geology|geologists]], and scientists from other disciplines.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; Cavanaugh ended up stranded in the [[Greater Boston]] area looking for a job, and ultimately replaced a "no show" in a [[Boston University]] [[undergraduate]] research program, which returned her to work with local horseshoe crabs.

Cavanaugh then moved to [[Cape Cod]] to work at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at Woods Hole. During the next two years the focus of her attention shifted from [[Crustacea]] to [[bacteria]], "creatures that impressed her for their ability to live anywhere."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

==Graduate training==
[[File:Nur04505.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cavanaugh's analyses of bacterial symbioses involving [[giant tube worms]] and other [[deep sea]] [[invertebrate]]shas led to her being described as a "scientific [[Captain Nemo]]."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;{{third-party inline|date=September 2016}}]]
Cavanaugh pursued her graduate training in biology at Harvard University, in association with the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. She entered Harvard in the fall of 1979, earning an M.A. in 1981 and graduating with her PhD in biology in 1985.&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Neil|title=At Large on the Blue Frontier|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/07/at-large-on-the-blue-fro.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Harvard Magazine|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Ph.D.]] dissertation, entitled ''Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates'', was accepted in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Colleen|title=Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates|date=1985|url=http://hollis.harvard.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=HVD&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;docId=HVD_ALEPH001337169&amp;fn=permalink|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of chemosynthesis in tube worms===
By one account, Cavanaugh was attending a lecture by Meredith L. Jones, curator of worms at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], shortly after she began her [[graduate school|graduate studies]]. Jones was discussing the giant tube worm, a creature lacking both [[mouth]] and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], where the challenge was to understand how it survived. Jones mentioned elemental [[sulfur]] crystals within the worms gut; Cavanaugh states that "It was at that point that I jumped up and said, 'Well, it's perfectly clear! They must have sulphur-oxidising bacteria inside their bodies'".&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt; Jones apparently told her to sit down,&lt;ref name="kunzig"/&gt; but provided Cavanaugh with a specimen captured by a research [[submarine]] working on the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Cavanaugh eventually substantiated her case.

The ''Harvard Gazette'' describes Cavanaugh's pioneering study of these unique creatures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a first-year graduate student, she discovered what makes life possible… where the sun never shines, [where] temperatures can exceed 250 degrees F, and [where] the ocean exerts pressures of thousands of pounds on every square inch of an animal's body. Giant worms, huge [[clam]]s and [[mussel]]s, and strange [[shrimp]] thrive in such conditions because of one-celled [[bacteria]] who live on and inside them. The bacteria turn sulfur, [[methane]], and other inedibles into [[organic molecule]]s that their hosts feed on.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cavanaugh went on to publish the results of the further work that began to substantiate the discovery, writing from the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at Harvard, as first of a five author paper, a short 1981 ''Science'' report with [[Stephen L. Gardiner]] and [[Meredith L. Jones]] of the Smithsonian Institution, and [[Holgar W. Jannasch]] and [[John B. Waterbury]] at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole]] (see Significant publications).

==Career==
Cavanaugh's first appointment was as a Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at [[Harvard University]], in 1986-1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was followed by elevation to assistant professorship in 1989, and associate professor in 1993. In 1995, she was granted tenure as a full professor "for [her] discoveries and her reputation as a teacher and mentor."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

==Research and outreach highlights==
Cavanaugh has continued to build her career on the study of hydrothermal vent ecology. Cavanaugh went on to discover similar symbiotic partnerships among [[Solemyidae]] clams living in shallow [[Zostera|eelgrass]] beds and [[mudflat]]s along the [[New England]] coast, and in shrimp near sub-sea springs in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;

Cavanaugh believes that [[life|life on Earth]] may have started under similar conditions and says "the idea makes sense because some of the oldest forms of free-living [[bacteria]] show signs of being heat-loving organisms."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; Cavanaugh's work has made the scientific community rethink the "warm [[chicken soup]]" [[theory]] of life's origins in which the accumulation of organic molecules in [[coast|shallow waters]] was a result of [[lightning]] [[electricity]].
[[File:Photo of Ruth Turner and Colleen Cavanaugh dissecting clams from the deep sea.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ruth Turner]] and Cavanaugh dissecting [[DSV Alvin|Alvin]] retrieved clams from the deep sea in 1992]]
Cavanaugh's discoveries of the biology of the deep [[Pacific Ocean]] were made in a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (Harvard) [[laboratory]], and she worked on marine life in the laboratory and onboard [[ship]]s for twelve years before securing a place on the deep-diving submarine ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''; she went to the bottom of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], off the [[Florida]] coast, for the first time in 1992. According to the ''Harvard Gazette'' article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not many people have visited with 6-foot-long, bright red worms on the boiling bottom of the ocean. It sounds like a [[Jules Verne]] fantasy, but newly tenured Professor of Biology Colleen Cavanaugh has seen these and other strange creatures on voyages to the bottom of the deep sea.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She later participated in more "Extreme Expeditions"—such as a dive to a depth of 8,200 feet off the west coast of [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; to collect tube worms and their bacteria, the chemically-rich fluids that flow out of the vents, and mineral samples from the [[deep sea]] ocean floor.&lt;ref name="UofDel-worms"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cavanaugh, Colleen and UDel EDF Staff |date=2003 |title=Extreme 2003: Exploring the Deep Frontier, 'Tubeworms: The "Rose Garden" on the Sea Floor,' and 'Mystery of the "Gutless Wonder"' |website=Ocean.UDel.edu/Extreme2003 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=University of Delaware, Department of Earth, Ocean, and Environment |url=http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2003/creatures/tubeworms/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530081121/http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2003/creatures/tubeworms/index.html |archive-date=2009-05-30 |access-date=12 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh, who has been called "a scientific [[Captain Nemo]]."&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; is prominent in her field of biology.Robert Kunzig, in describing her work for a 2001 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine article, writes of her visit to "a hot crack in the Earth under the [[Indian Ocean]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Biologists who study the [[physiology]] of organisms are under time pressure: They must dissect the organisms before they deteriorate. Colleen Cavanaugh, a microbiologist from Harvard, needs animals that are alive and not starved; once they've been away from their vent too long, even if they've been sitting in a box on the ocean floor, they start to digest the symbiotic bacteria in which she is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kunzig, Robert |year=2001 |title=Expedition to the Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |issue=December 1 |pages= |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/dec/cover |access-date=12 September 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014115811/http://discovermagazine.com/2001/dec/cover |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As reported in February 2000, Cavanaugh is the discoverer of a new [[species]] of deep-dwelling mussel in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] that shares its body with symbiotic bacteria that feed on methane.&lt;ref name="tenure"/&gt; She joined Craig Smith of the University of Hawaii and other colleagues in a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' report on a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[National Undersea Research Program]] study at its West Coast and Polar Regions Center (at the [[University of Alaska, Fairbanks]]), regarding how [[whale]] [[corpse]]s that drop to the bottom of the ocean—and their [[bone]]s in particular—play an important role in [[ocean floor]] ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Jana|title=OCEANOGRAPHERS SAY DEAD WHALES PROVIDE DEEP-SEA LIVING LEGACY|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2000/feb00/noaa00r506.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=February 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oceanographers Say Dead Whales Provide Deep-Sea Living Legacy|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/02/000218055946.htm|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Science Daily|date=February 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Distel|first1=Daniel|last2=Baco|first2=Amy|last3=Chuang|first3=Ellie|last4=Morrill|first4=Wendy|last5=Cavanaugh|first5=Colleen|last6=Smith|first6=Craig|title=Marine ecology: Do mussels take wooden steps to deep-sea vents?|journal=Nature|date=February 17, 2000|volume=403|issue=725–726|pages=725–726|doi=10.1038/35001667|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6771/full/403725a0.html#a2|accessdate=15 September 2016|bibcode=2000Natur.403..725D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9335">'''Compaction of ceramic powders''' is a specific [[Ceramic forming techniques|forming technique for ceramics]]. It is  a process in which ceramic granular materials are made cohesive through  mechanical densification, involving (hot pressing) or not (cold  forming) temperature exposition.
The process permits an efficient production of parts ranging widely in  size and shape to close tolerances with low drying shrinkage. Traditional  (for instance: ceramic tiles, porcelain products) and structural (for  instance: chip carriers, spark plugs, cutting tools) ceramics are  produced.
Cold compaction of ceramic powders ends up with the realization of the  so-called green piece, which is later subject to sintering.

== The background: traditional &amp; advanced ceramics ==
[[Ceramic]] industry is broadly developed in the world, so much so that only in Europe the current investment is estimated at € 26 billion. Advanced ceramics are crucial for new technologies, addressed particularly to thermo-mechanical and bio-medical applications, while traditional ceramics have a worldwide market and have been suggested as materials minimizing the impact on the environment (when compared to other finishing materials).

== The production process of ceramics ==
Up-to-date ceramic technology involves invention and design of new components and optimization of production process of complex structures. Ceramics can be formed by a variety of different methods which can be divided into three main groups, depending on whether the starting materials involve a gas, a liquid or a solid. Examples of methods involving gases are: chemical vapour deposition, directed metal oxidation and reaction bonding, whereas examples of methods involving liquids are: sol-gel process and polymer pyrolysis. Methods involving solids, and especially powder methods, dominate ceramic forming and are extensively used in the industry.

The practical realization of ceramic products by powder methods requires the following steps: ceramic powder production, powder treatment, handling and processing, cold forming, sintering and evaluation of the performance of the final product. Since this process permits an efficient production of parts ranging widely in size and shape to close tolerances, there is an evident interest from industry. For instance, metallurgical, pharmaceutical and forming of traditional and advanced structural ceramics represent common applications.

== Mechanics of forming of ceramic powders ==
[[File:Ceramic cracked piece.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fig. 1 A piece (formed with M KMS-96 alumina powder) has been broken after mold ejection.]]It is a well-established fact that the performance of a ceramic component critically depends on the manufacturing process. In particular, initial powder characteristics and processing, including cold forming and sintering, have a strong impact on the mechanical properties of the components as they may generate a defect population (microcracks, density gradients, pores, agglomerates) within the green and sintered compounds. In particular, the mechanical characteristics of the solid obtained after cold forming (the so-called ‘green body’) strongly affect the subsequent sintering process and thus the mechanical properties of the final piece.

Many technical, still unresolved difficulties arise in the forming process of ceramic materials. In fact, if on one hand the compact should result intact after ejection, should be handleable without failure and essentially free of macro defects, on the other hand, defects of various nature are always present in the green bodies, negatively affecting local shrinkage during sintering, Fig. 1. 

Defects can be caused by densification process, which may involve highly inhomogeneous strain fields, or by mold ejection. Currently, there is a high production reject, due to the fact that manufacturing technologies are mainly based on empirically engineered processes, rather than on rational and scientific methodologies.

[[File:Alumina powder.pdf|350px|thumb|left|Fig. 2 Micrographs of a M KMS-96 alumina powder. The loose state is shown on the left, while granule arrangements corresponding to Phases I and II of the compaction process are shown on the centre and on the right. Note the plastic deformation of grains visible on the right.]]

The industrial technologies involved in the production of ceramics, with particular reference to tile and sanitaryware products, are directly connected to a huge amount of waste of material and energy.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For the raw material grinding, big mills (with an installed power of up to a 1 MW) are used to refine the particle size of the slip but the major amount of power is lost just to increase the temperature of the slip itself. For the drying of the slip, big spray driers are used with up to 500 KW electrical power and 15.000.000 Kcal/h of thermal power : 80% of the thermal capacity of the machine is lost at the chimney with a not negligible percentage of the powder itself that is lost in the environment. For the forming of the powder, big presses (up to 7.500 ton of force and 250 KW of installed power) are used but only 5% of this energy is stored in the compacted final product. In the following step of drying and sintering, big burners with a consumption of 10.000.000 Kcal/h are used but the most of the energy is wasted at the chimney. A big volume of waste glaze is also produced along the glazing line and only a little part can be recycled in the plant itself. Even a small increase of the mechanical strength of the ceramic body would lead to a reduction in the weight of the ceramic article with a deep effect in the reduction of the above pollution effects.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the set-up of manufacturing processes is very costly and time consuming and not yet optimal in terms of quality of the final piece. 

There is therefore a strong interest from  the ceramic industry in the availability of tools capable of modelling and simulating: i) the powder compaction process and ii) the criticality of defects possibly present in the final piece after sintering. Recently, an EU IAPP research project [http://intercer2.unitn.it/] has been financed with the aim of enhance mechanical modelling of ceramic forming in view of industrial applications.

During cold powder compaction, a granular material is made cohesive through mechanical densification, a process which modelling requires the description of the transition from a granular to a dense and even a fully dense state (Fig. 2). 

[[File:Hardening process.gif|350px|thumb|left|Fig. 3 The hardening process during hydrostatic powder compaction described with the Bigoni &amp; Piccolroaz yield surface.]]Since granular materials are characterized by mechanical properties almost completely different from those typical of dense solids, the mechanical modelling must describe a transition between two distinctly different states of a material. This is a scientific challenge addressed by Piccolroaz et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/ A. Piccolroaz, D. Bigoni and A. Gajo, An elastoplastic framework for granular materials becoming cohesive through mechanical densification. Part I - small strain formulation. European Journal of Mechanics A: Solids, 2006, 25, 334-357.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~piccolro/ A. Piccolroaz, D. Bigoni and A. Gajo, An elastoplastic framework for granular materials becoming cohesive through mechanical densification. Part II - the formulation of elastoplastic coupling at large strain. European Journal of Mechanics A: Solids, 2006, 25, 358-369.]&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bigoni, D. Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: Bifurcation Theory and Material Instability. Cambridge University Press, 2012 . {{ISBN|9781107025417}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key point in their analysis is the use of the ‘Bigoni &amp; Piccolroaz [[yield surface]]’, previously developed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/ Bigoni and A. Piccolroaz, Yield criteria for quasibrittle and frictional materials. International Journal of Solids and Structures, 2004, 41(11-12), 2855-2878.]&lt;/ref&gt; see Fig. 3.[[File:Mechanical model v2.jpg|4000x150px|thumb|right|Fig. 4 A mechanical model of ceramic forming correctly predicts: (left) the load/displacement curve during cold pressing, (centre) the density (void ratio) map within a formed piece and (right) the dark annular region evidenced on the bottom of a formed piece.]] 

The mechanical model developed by Piccoloraz et al. (2006 a;b) permits the description of the forming process (Fig. 4).
The INTERCER2 [http://intercer2.unitn.it/] research project is aimed to develop novel constitutive descriptions for ceramic powders and more robust implementation in a numerical code.

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

'''Dam removal''' is the process of demolishing a [[dam]], leaving a river to flow freely. It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense.

All dams negatively affect the aquatic environments of rivers that they are located on, but those effects are often negated by the stated purpose of the dam, whether it is hydroelectric power, flood control, or other functions. When the [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|negative environmental effects]] outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal. This happened on the [[Elwha River]] in [[Olympic National Park]] in Washington when extraordinarily rich salmon habitat was being disrupted by an out-dated hydroelectric plant. Before dams were built on the Elwha River, 400,000 salmon returned each year to spawn, but that number dropped to fewer than 3,000 after dams were put up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/08/29/removing-dams-and-restoring-rivers/|title=Removing Dams and Restoring Rivers|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the hydroelectric power generating capacities of the dams had outlived their useful lives, the importance of this salmon habitat necessitated the removal of the dams on the Elwha River.

Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams. Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam. Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail. Around the world, a growing number of 20th-century dam construction projects are reaching the end of their design lives: as of 1996, 5,000 large dams around the world were more than 50 years old.[1]  By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country’s dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam. The cost of keeping outdated hydroelectric equipment running decades after it was installed or upgrading dam safety systems may not be worth it. Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose.

Since around 2000, most major dam removal projects, and the largest single project, the $350M removal of two [[Olympic Peninsula]] dams as part of the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]], have been driven by restoration of river habitat and fish passages.  Inspired by the Elwha project, a French group called ''SOS Loire Vivante'' successfully lobbied for the removal of two dams in the Upper [[Loire Valley]], and the re-engineering of a 1941 hydroelectric dam on the [[Allier River]] to restore habitat for [[Atlantic salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xin|first1=Guo|title=French Dam Removal Opens Way for Atlantic Salmon|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/french-dam-removal-opens-way-for-atlantic-salmon-1632|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=internationalrivers.org|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States roughly 900 dams were removed between 1990 and 2015, with another 50 to 60 more every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Struck|first1=Doug|title=Setting rivers free: As dams are torn down, nature is quickly recovering|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2014/0803/Setting-rivers-free-As-dams-are-torn-down-nature-is-quickly-recovering|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  France and Canada have also completed significant removal projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhao-Yin Wang, Joseph H.W.

==Purposes and effects of dams==
[[Image:Grand Coulee Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia River, Washington, United States]]

Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for [[water diversion]], [[agriculture]], factory [[watermill]]s, and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] fish runs, such as [[Atlantic salmon]] and [[American shad]], and prevent important sediments from reaching [[estuaries]].

Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural [[water diversion]] in the arid country, with [[hydroelectric]] power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the [[Columbia Basin Project]], which diverts water at the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] manages many of these water diversion projects.

Some dams in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California]] block passage for anadromous fish species such as [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. [[Fish ladder]]s and other passage facilities have been largely ineffective{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. [[Bonneville Power Administration]] manages electricity on 11 dams on the [[Columbia River]] and 4 on the [[Snake River]], which were built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[Image:Grand Canyon Horse Shoe Bend MC.jpg|thumb|right|Clear water below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, United States]]

In the [[Desert Southwest]], dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the [[Grand Canyon]], which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including [[humpback chub]] and [[razorback sucker]].

Some dam projects, such as those on the [[Salt River Project]] in [[Arizona]], eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the [[Arizona Canal]] system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] heads out across the desert.

So much water is taken out of the [[Colorado River]] for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the [[Gulf of California]].

== Methods of removal ==
There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/hr/print/volume-31/issue-07/articles/sediment-strategies-choosing-a-sediment-management-option-for-dam-removal.html|title=Sediment Strategies: Choosing a Sediment Management Option for Dam Removal|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below.

Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure.
[[File:Notch and release approach at Glines Canyon Dam on Elwha River.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Here five notches can be seen at the Glines Canyon Dam as it was removed in a multi-year process.]]
Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notch and release approach ===
The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits. It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam. New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow. The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This method can take months or even over a year but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers. The [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration|Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project]] used the notch and release approach to great success.

=== Rapid release approach ===
The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks. In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir. The entire body of water will drain through this tunnel in a matter of minutes or hours and the massive release of water and sediment can cause severe flooding and erosion along the river downstream for miles. This can devastate the riparian ecosystem along the river as well as dangerously scour bridge pilings, buried pipes, levees, and other infrastructure. However, if the reservoir held back by the dam is relatively small and quickly drains into a larger river or lake, this approach can be carried out with minimal impact on either the ecosystem or human infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dig and dewater approach ===
The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases. It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal. It is costly and slow, but if the reservoir is located very near hydroelectric generating facilities that would be greatly impacted by released sediments, it may be necessary. Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins. Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river.

=== Retained sediment approach ===
The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is. To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging. This may be carried out in places where the dig and dewater approach makes sense, but are too remote to be cost-effective.

== Alternatives to removal ==
[[File:John Day Dam fish ladder.jpg|left|thumb|340x340px|Fish ladder at John Day Dam on the Columbia River.]]

While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing [[environmental flow]]. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, [[fish ladder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Fish ladder|s]] can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There’s debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location.

== Completed projects ==

[[File:Condit Dam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Condit Dam, Washington, United States]]

* 1973 - Lewiston Dam, [[South Fork Clearwater River]], [[Idaho]] – The {{convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam was built in 1927 as a hydroelectric facility, but lacked [[fish ladders]]. Upon completion of the [[Lower Granite Dam]] and its reservoir, the lack of gradient on the river made it obsolete. Its removal improved salmon runs on the river.
* 1997 - Marie Dorian Dam, [[Walla Walla River]], Oregon – The {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked passage to [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] into the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] from the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]].
* 1999 - [[Edwards Dam]], [[Kennebec River]], [[Maine]] – Built in 1837, the {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access to [[Atlantic Salmon]] and [[American Shad]].  This was a landmark case in which a U.S. federal agency, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], required the decommissioning and removal of a dam against the operator's wishes.
* 2004 - Embrey Dam, [[Rappahannock River]], [[Virginia]] - The 22-foot-tall, 770-foot-long, 1910 hydroelectric Embrey Dam was blown up with 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosives by the [[U.S. Army Dive team out of Ft. Eustis, VA]] on February 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrivers.org/our-work/restoring-rivers/dams/projects/embrey-dam.html|title=Dams and Hydropower|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of removal was to re-open miles of spawning grounds to aid populations of [[American Shad]], herring, catadromous American eel, and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/022006/02232006/170364|title=Embrey Dam just a memory|work=Fredericksburg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical character of the [[Nils F. Ambursen|Ambursen]]-type reinforced concrete structure required a parallel documentation and (partial) preservation project by industrial archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/bloededam/image/FINAL_BOOK_LAYOUT.pdf|title=dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 longtime U.S. Senator from Virginia [[John Warner]] described the removal of Embrey Dam as the "proudest achievement in his legislative career."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2008/092008/09232008/412067/index_html?page=2 |title=Rapids to be named for John Warner |date=2008-09-23 |first=Rusty |last=Dennen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004 - [[Cuddebackville Dam]], [[Neversink River]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - Built in two portions dating from the 1820s (for water diversion into a canal) and 1915 (for hydroelectric power), the dam had been abandoned since 1945.  The dam was removed in October 2004 by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], in a novel partnership with the [[Nature Conservancy]], to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the [[Dwarf Wedge Mussel]] and the [[American Shad]].
* 2007 - [[Marmot Dam]], [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], Oregon – The removal of this {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam by [[Portland General Electric]] has been extremely successful at improving access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] to the upper Sandy River watershed up into the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]].
* 2008 - [[Milltown Dam]], [[Clark Fork River, Blackfoot River (Montana)|Missoula]], Montana - Dam held startling levels of toxic sediments from 100 years of mining and logging. Removal improved water quality, trout habitat, and the general ecological condition of the watershed.
* 2009 - [[Savage Rapids Dam]], [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]], [[Oregon]] – Built for agricultural [[water diversion]], it was removed by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] due to its out-dated facilities and non-functioning fish ladders that prevented fish migration past the dam.
* 2011 - [[Condit Dam]], [[White Salmon River]], Washington – The {{convert|123|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] runs on {{convert|33|mi|km}} of river. [[PacifiCorp]] proposed to remove the dam, rather than paying for fish passage upgrades. Removal was proposed in 2006, but actions from [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania]] and [[Klickitat County, Washington|Klickitat]] counties held up the process. In fall 2008, salmon were trucked up above to dam to allow them to spawn higher up the river. In October 2011, PacifiCorp contractors used explosives to blow a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the dam to drain its reservoir and allow young salmon to enter the [[Columbia River]] and head to sea.
* 2012 - [[Elwha Dam|Elwha]] and [[Glines Canyon Dam]]s, [[Elwha River]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] – The largest dam removal project in history is the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]] project on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. Starting in 2012, and finishing in 2014, the {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Elwha Dam]] and the {{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glines Canyon Dam]] were removed to restore stocks of [[Pacific Salmon]] and trout species to the [[Elwha River]] watershed. The removal of these blockades allows migratory salmon to travel past the dam sites and upriver, an event that has not occurred since the dams' creation in 1913.

==Proposed removals==

===Lower Snake River Dams, Washington, US===

[[File:LGLandDam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little Goose Dam]], Washington, USA]]

Four dams along the lower [[Snake River]], built and still operated by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], serve as hydroelectric power sources as well as maintaining an inland port at [[Lewiston, Idaho]] for agricultural barge traffic.  The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities.  They include:  the 1975 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Granite Dam]], the 1970 {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Little Goose Dam]], the 1969 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Monumental Dam]], and the 1962 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Ice Harbor Dam]].

Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, E. (2007, February 16). Corps of engineers gets earful about sediment problems. Lewiston Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.  As of 2011, two feet remained.  As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised.  The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Restore Wild Salmon?"

The Corps began dredging behind Lower Granite Dam in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://portoflewiston.com/facts/dredging/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rindge Dam and Matilija Dam, Southern California===

[[File:Rindge Dam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rindge Dam]] near [[Malibu, California]], built in 1924, completely silted and abandoned by the 1950s]]

The {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} privately owned [[Rindge Dam]] on [[Malibu Creek]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] of California was built in 1924 and has been allowed to completely fill with sediment, making it functionally obsolete but still a potential hazard.  Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] population in the world. But today, steelhead no longer occupy the creek.

The similar 1947 [[Matilija Dam]] near [[Ojai, California]] was built against the advice of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], among others, and also blocked steelhead trout spawning grounds.  After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost.  As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Cheri|title=Delayed plan to remove Matilija Dam near Ojai will get new studies|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/delayed-plan-to-remove-matilija-dam-near-ojai-will-get-new-studies-ep-293034957-351781061.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=Ventura County Star|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klamath River Dams, California / Oregon border===

{{main|Klamath River Hydroelectric Project}}

[[File:Klamath tribes dam removal demo.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators calling for removal of dams on the [[Klamath River]] in Oregon and California, USA]]

As resolution of several long-range issues centered on water rights in the [[Klamath Basin]], the multi-party [[Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement]] was signed in early 2008.  Parties to the agreement included the state of [[California]], the state of [[Oregon]], three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement|url=http://klamathrestoration.gov/sites/klamathrestoration.gov/files/Klamath-Agreements/Klamath-Basin-Restoration-Agreement-2-18-10signed.pdf|website=Klamath Restoration|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement called for the removal of four of the [[Klamath River Hydroelectric Project]] dams: the 1958 [[John C. Boyle Dam]], the 1922 [[Copco Number 1 Dam|Copco Number 1]] and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 [[Iron Gate Dam (California)|Iron Gate Dam]].  All four are privately owned by [[PacifiCorp]].  At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa]]'' in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs.

On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Fimrite | first=P. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/30/MNMM19UDKH.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Deal to raze 4 Klamath dams | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date= 30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/New-plan-to-remove-Klamath-River-dams-without-6801869.php|title=New plan to remove Klamath River dams without help from Congress|first=Carolyn |last=Lochhead|date=3 February 2016|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29738226/klamath-river-dam-removal-deal-signed-by-top|title=Klamath River dam removal deal signed by top federal, state officials|first=Will | last=Houston |date=7 April 2016|publisher=Eureka Times-Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glen Canyon Dam, northern Arizona ===

[[Image:Glencanyondam.jpg|thumb|right|Glen Canyon Dam]]

The {{convert|710|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glen Canyon Dam]] has been proposed for removal because of the negative effects it has on the water quality and riparian habitat of the [[Colorado River]] in [[Grand Canyon National Park]]. In addition, the reservoir impounded behind it, [[Lake Powell]] has filled all of the canyons for up to {{convert|160|mi|km}} above the dam. This lake, while providing recreational opportunities, has eliminated more than {{convert|160|mi|km}} of habitat for endangered [[Colorado River]] fish species.

The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Glen Canyon?|url=http://www.glencanyon.org/glen_canyon/why-glen-canyon|work=Glen Canyon Institute|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of dam removal such as the [[Glen Canyon Institute]] also cite these losses of stored water as reason to decommission the dam.   If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history.

===O'Shaughnessy (Hetch Hetchy) Dam, California===

The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout. The Kinnickinnic River is officially designated as a Class I [[trout]] stream by the WI DNR, indicating it is a "high quality" trout water that has sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carrying capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/trout/streamclassification.html|title=Trout stream classifications - Wisconsin DNR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kinnickinnic is also designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) by the WI DNR both above State HWY 35, and below the Powell Falls Dam, however, the stretch of the Kinni through the City of River Falls is not included in this designation where the river is impounded into two reservoirs which do not support a fishery.  This ORW designation indicates the Kinni provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities.&lt;ref name="dnr.wi.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/surfacewater/orwerw.html|title=Use Designations - Wisconsin DNR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.&lt;ref name="dnr.wi.gov"/&gt;

Local stakeholder organizations in the FERC relicensing process include [http://www.friendsofthekinni.org/ the Friends of the Kinni], [http://www.kiaptuwish.org/ the Kiap-TU-Wish Chapter of Trout Unlimited], [http://kinniriver.org/ the Kinnickinnic River Land Trust], and [https://www.wisconsinrivers.org/ the River Alliance of Wisconsin]. Government agencies also serving as stakeholder organizations include the Wisconsin DNR, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4211">In [[population ecology]] '''delayed density dependence''' describes a situation where [[population growth]] is controlled by [[negative feedback]] operating with a time [[lag]].&lt;ref&gt;BONSALL, M.B., HASAN, N. and NAKAMURA, K., 2007. Density dependence and noise determine the long-term dynamics of two species of lady beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae: Epilachninae) in the Indonesian tropics. Ecological Entomology, 32(1), pp. 28-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population cycles==

Delayed [[density dependence]] has been used by [[ecology|ecologists]] to explain [[population cycle]]s.&lt;ref name="Turchin"&gt;TURCHIN, P., TAYLOR, A.D. and REEVE, J.D., 1999. Dynamical role of predators in population cycles of a forest insect: An experimental test. Science, 285(5430), pp. 1068-1071.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists have been unable to successfully explain regular population cycles for many decades; delayed density dependence may hold the answer.&lt;ref name="Turchin"/&gt; Here populations are allowed to increase above their normal [[Carrying capacity|capacity]] because there is a time [[lag]] until [[negative feedback]] mechanisms bring the population back down. This effect has been used to explain the widely fluctuating population cycles of [[lemmings]],&lt;ref name="framstad"&gt;FRAMSTAD, E., STENSETH, N.C., BJORNSTAD, O.N. and FALCK, W., 1997. Limit cycles in Norwegian lemmings: Tensions between phase-dependence and density-dependence. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 264(1378), pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt; forest [[insects]] as well as the population cycles of larger [[mammals]] such as [[moose]] and [[wolves]].&lt;ref&gt;POST, E., STENSETH, N.C., PETERSON, R.O., VUCETICH, J.A. and ELLIS, A.M., 2002. Phase dependence and population cycles in a large-mammal predator-prey system. Ecology, 83(11), pp. 2997-3002.&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of population cycles include cycling [[abiotic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;HUNTER, M.D. and PRICE, P.W., 2000. Detecting cycles and delayed density dependence: A reply to Turchin and Berryman. Ecological Entomology, 25(1), pp. 122-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

The causes of delayed density dependence vary in each situation. In lemmings, food supply and [[predation]] are the most important factors that lead to delayed density dependence.&lt;ref name="framstad"/&gt; 
[[Competition]] between life stages is another cause. In some species of [[moth]] the practice of [[Egg (biology)|egg]] [[cannibalism]] takes place where older moths eat eggs of their own species.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;BRIGGS, C.J., SAIT, S.M., BEGON, M., THOMPSON, D.J. and GODFRAY, H.C.J., 2000. What causes generation cycles in populations of stored-product moths? Journal of Animal Ecology, 69(2), pp. 352-366.&lt;/ref&gt; This produces imbalances in the population levels of different [[Generation|generations]] leading to delayed density dependence.&lt;ref name="briggs"/&gt; 
[[Disease]] is another causative factor. The delay is introduced because of the time it takes for enough [[susceptible individual]]s to be present for the disease to spread again.&lt;ref&gt;BJØRNSTAD, O.N., SAIT, S.M., STENSETH, N.C., THOMPSON, D.J. and BEGON, M., 2001. The impact of specialized enemies on the dimensionality of host dynamics. Nature, 409(6823), pp. 1001-1006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The delay to [[sexual maturity]] introduces delayed density dependence in many instances. In this case there is density dependent inhibition applied to organisms when they are sexually immature.&lt;ref&gt;COOKE, K.L., ELDERKIN, R.H. and HUANG, W., 2006. Predator-prey interactions with delays due to juvenile maturation. SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, 66(3), pp. 1050-1079.&lt;/ref&gt; When this generation reaches sexual maturity there are fewer [[offspring]], continuing the pattern.

==Methods of detection==

[[Autocorrelation]] is the principal method by which delayed density dependence can be detected. [[Time series]] are analysed for repeating patterns.&lt;ref&gt;(1998). Insect populations in theory and in practice: 19th Symposium of the Royal Entomological Society 10–11 September 1997 at the University of Newcastle. Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Einstein protocol''' is a [[Technical standard|standard]] used for precisely [[measuring]] the [[distance]] between two objects in [[outer space|space]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://physicsworld.com/a/improving-measurements-of-space-and-time/ Improving measurements of space and time]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Einstein protocol of finding the distance between two points is sending light from point {{var|a}} to point {{var|b}} and then immediately sending a signal, using light, from point {{var|b}} to point {{var|a}}. The calculations done with this data uses the formula &lt;math&gt;
D = c {{t_3 - t_1} \over 2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

== The protocol ==
Because there are many factors in measuring the distance of space a protocol was set up to determine order of importance when measuring a distance, using light, from {{var|a}} to {{var|b}} and back.

== References ==
&lt;references /&gt;

==Footnotes==
Because space is not linear we can attribute one factor to the curvature of space and time when light is sent from one area to the next.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16548">'''Elevational diversity gradient''' (EDG) is an ecological pattern where trends in [[biodiversity]] occur at different [[elevation]]s. The EDG states that [[species richness]] tends to increase as elevation increases, up to a certain point, creating a "diversity bulge" at middle elevations. There have been multiple hypotheses proposed for explaining the EDG, none of which accurately describe the phenomenon in full.

[[File:MontanaMountains.jpeg|thumb|View of Mont LeConte in Great Smokey Mountains National Park, Tennessee]]

A similar pattern, known as the [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradient]], describes an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the [[equator]]. While the EDG generally follows the LDG (i.e., high elevations in tropical regions have greater biodiversity than high elevations in temperate regions), the LDG does not account for elevational changes.

==Origin==
The first recorded observation of the elevational diversity gradient was by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his treatise ''On the growth of the habitable earth''. In this document, Linnaeus based his predictions on [[flood geology]], assuming most of the world was at one point inundated, leaving only the highest elevations available for terrestrial life. Since, by Linnaeus’ hypothesis, all life was concentrated at high elevations, a higher species diversity would be observed there even as life re-populated lower elevations.

In 1799, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]] described elevational changes along the [[Andes|Andean]] slopes, noting how climatic changes impacted plant and animal communities. These observations contributed to [[Leslie Holdridge|Leslie R. Holdridge’s]] "life zone concept" (1947). Climatic variables shaping life zones include mean potential temperature, total annual precipitation, and the ratio of mean annual [[evapotranspiration]] to mean annual precipitation. These variables, most notably precipitation and temperature, vary along an elevational gradient, resulting in the distribution of different ecosystems.&lt;ref name=kricher2011&gt;Kricher, J. C. (2011) What and where are the tropics? Tropical Ecology, pp. 7-25. Princeton UP, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the current literature correlates elevational diversity to gradients in single climatic or biotic variables including "rainfall, temperature, productivity, competition, resource abundance, habitat complexity, or habitat diversity".&lt;ref name=mccain2005&gt;McCain &amp; Christy M. (2005) Elevational gradients in diversity of small mammals. Ecology, 86.2, 366-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Mid-domain effect===
A pattern in species richness is also observed as one moves along an elevational gradient; generally, species richness is thought to decline with increasing elevation. Whether this decline is monotonic or if it assumes different shapes based on the [[taxa]] or region being studied is still a topic of debate. In a review of previous studies looking at elevational diversity gradients, Rahbek noted the importance of other factors contributing to the shape of a gradient, distinguishing elevational patterns from those described by the latitudinal diversity gradient.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995&gt;Rahbek, C. (1995) The elevational gradient of species richness – a uniform pattern. Ecography, 18, 200–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

For certain taxa and regions, there is a mid elevational peak in species richness. This pattern has received empirical support for small mammals,&lt;ref name=mccain2004&gt;McCain, C. M. (2004) The mid-domain effect applied to elevational gradients: species richness of small mammals in Costa Rica.

(2008) Microbes on mountainsides: contrasting elevational patterns of bacterial and plant diversity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105, 11505–11511.&lt;/ref&gt; but also increasing, hump-shaped, and U-shaped elevational patterns in diversity.&lt;ref name="WangMeier2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Jianjun|last2=Meier|first2=Sandra|last3=Soininen|first3=Janne|last4=Casamayor|first4=Emilio O.|last5=Pan|first5=Feiyan|last6=Tang|first6=Xiangming|last7=Yang|first7=Xiangdong|last8=Zhang|first8=Yunlin|last9=Wu|first9=Qinglong|last10=Zhou|first10=Jizhong|last11=Shen|first11=Ji|title=Regional and global elevational patterns of microbial species richness and evenness|journal=Ecography|volume=40|issue=3|year=2016|pages=393-402|issn=09067590|doi=10.1111/ecog.02216|hdl=10261/131604}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One explanation for a mid elevational peak includes mid elevational [[condensation]] zones.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; Under the assumption that natural boundaries can limit species distributions in varying degrees (for example, a mountain can present absolute elevational limits), Collwell and Lees explained the mid domain effect with geometric theory.&lt;ref name=colwell2000&gt;Colwell, R.K. &amp; Lees, D.C. (2000) The mid-domain effect: geometric constraints on the geography of species richness. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, 70–76.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a mountain, geometric boundary constraints will naturally result in the increasing overlap of species ranges nearing the midpoint of the mountain. Using [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[epiphyte]]s in [[Costa Rica]], Cardelus et al. (2008) noted that the elevational species richness pattern observed was substantially due to the mid domain effect; there was a bulge in epiphyte species richness at 1000m (The [[cloud forest]]).
&lt;!--
[[File:Tropical Ecology Epiphytes.jpg|thumb|Virola with epiphytes (left) and a Virola branch with large bromeliads, ''Werhauia kupperiana'', and fern, ''Phlebodium auretum'']]
--&gt;

This elevational pattern, however, was less consistent for species with small ranges, suggesting that environmental factors may be more clearly accounted for when constraints on domain boundary are loosened. In cases where geometric models fail to explain the location of the midpoint or the trend in species richness, other explanations need to be explored. An example of this can be seen with microbes, which have been shown to exhibit monotonically decreasing diversity when moving from low to high elevations.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;

===Mountain-mass effect===
The mountain-mass effect (also known as the [[Massenerhebung effect]] or mass-elevation effect) was proposed in 1904 by [[A. de Quarvain]]. This phenomenon recognizes the correlation between mountain mass and the occurrence of physiognomically similar vegetation types; similarity in vegetation type is observed at higher elevations on large mountain masses.&lt;ref name=flenley1994&gt;Flenley, J. R. (1994) Tropical mon-tane cloud forests. Cloud forest, the Massenerhebung effect, and ultraviolet insolation  (eds L. S. Hamil-ton, J. O. Juvik &amp; E N. Scatena), pp. 150-155. Spring-er-Verlag, New York, New York, USA. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, under a climatically driven mountain–mass effect, there is a “positive linear trend observed in the elevation of highest diversity with mountain height”.&lt;ref name=mccain2005 /&gt; This trend is most evident on isolated mountain peaks.

==Hypotheses==

===Area Hypothesis===
Another hypothesis that is cited to explain the upper limit of the elevational diversity gradient is the area hypothesis, which states that larger areas are able to support more species. As elevation increases, total area decreases; thus, there are more species present at middle elevations than high elevations.

However, this hypothesis does not account for differences between [[lowland]] areas and middle elevations, as lowlands tend to have more area than middle elevations and thus would be expected by this hypothesis to have higher species diversity, an assertion that runs counter to the EDG. Additionally, the area hypothesis does not take climatic conditions or resource availability into account.

===Rainfall hypothesis===
This hypothesis states that diversity increases with increasing [[rainfall]],&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; however the correlation between rainfall and plant diversity varies from region to region.  The consistency of rainfall seems to correlate more with species richness than total annual rainfall. Species diversity appears to level off when annual rainfall reaches about 4,000mm, however this could be due to sampling limitations. Rainfall and soil richness affect productivity trends which are also believed to affect diversity.&lt;ref name=gentry1988&gt;Gentry, A.H. (1988) Changes in plant community diversity and floristic composition on environmental and geographical gradients. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 75.1, 1-34. 
&lt;/ref&gt; A mid elevation peak is usually seen in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992&gt;Rosenzweig, M.L. (1992) Species diversity gradients: we know more and less than we thought. Journal of Mammalogy, 73.4, 715-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource diversity hypothesis===
The resource diversity hypothesis states an increase in diversity can be seen when an increase in the diversity of available resources such as soil and food is present.&lt;ref name=gentry1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanchez2001&gt;SÁnchez-Cordero, V. (2001) Elevation gradients of diversity for rodents and bats in Oaxaca, Mexico. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In this hypothesis diversity increases in an area of higher resource diversity even when resource abundance is constant. However resource diversity, especially pertaining to food, could be a result of other influences, such as rainfall and [[productivity]]; as such, it may be inappropriate to consider the resource diversity hypothesis as a mechanism acting independently of other factors influencing diversity gradients.&lt;ref name=heaney2001&gt;Heaney, L. R. (2001) Small mammal diversity along elevational gradients in the Philippines: an assessment of patterns and hypotheses. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 15–39.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity hypothesis===
The productivity hypothesis states that diversity increases with increased productivity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; There is some contradiction to this as other research suggests that after a certain point increasing productivity actually correlates with a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=sanders2007&gt;Sanders, N.J., Lessard, J.P., Fitzpatrick, M.C. &amp; Dunn, R.R. (2007) Temperature, but not productivity or geometry, predicts elevational diversity gradients in ants across spatial grains. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16, 640–649.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally thought that productivity decreases with an increase in elevation, however there is some research that shows a peak in productivity at mid elevation which may be related to a peak in rainfall within the same area.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt;

===Temperature hypothesis===
The temperature hypothesis correlates increasing temperature with an increase in species diversity, mainly because of temperature's effect on productivity.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; However increasing temperatures due to [[climate change]] have begun to be linked to the spread of [[chytrid]] among frogs in the Tropics. Another concern is that higher-elevation species will become extinct as their ranges become more and more restricted with an increase in temperature.&lt;ref name=pounds2006&gt;Pounds, J. A., Martín R. Bustamante, Luis A. Coloma, Jamie A. Consuegra, Michael P. L. Fogden, Pru N. Foster, Enrique La Marca, Karen L. Masters, Andrés Merino-Viteri, Robert Puschendorf, Santiago R. Ron, G. Arturo Sánchez-Azofeifa, Christopher J. Still, and Bruce E. Young. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Disease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.7073 (2006): 161-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is an important factor in considering the [[effects of global warming]].

===Competition===
There are conflicting views on the effect of [[competition (biology)|competition]] on species diversity. Some hold the view that an increase in interspecies competition leads to local [[extinction]]s and a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; Others view competition as a means of species specialization and niche partitioning, resulting in increase diversity.&lt;ref name=menge1976&gt;Menge, B. A. &amp; Sutherland, J.P. (1976) Species diversity gradients: synthesis of the roles of predation, competition, and temporal heterogeneity. The American Naturalist, 351-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other studies the competition between plant species at high elevations has been shown to facilitate the movement of plant species into high stress environments. The competition between plant species leads to hardier species spreading into the high stress environment. These founder species then provide shelter and facilitate the movement of less hardy species into the area.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=choler2001&gt;Choler, P., Michalet R. &amp; Callaway, R.M. (2001) Facilitation and competition on gradients in alpine plant communities. Ecology, 82, 3295-3308.&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the movement of plant species up a mountainside.

==State of research==
Current research illuminates a variety of mechanisms than can be used to explain elevational diversity gradients. No one factor can be used to explain the present of diversity gradients within and among taxa; in many cases, we must consider more than one hypothesis or mechanism to fully understand a pattern in elevational diversity. The emerging macroecological experiments along environmental gradients (for example, mountain elevation gradients) are an important tool in ecological research because they allow for the disentangling the effects of individual environmental drivers on biodiversity, the independent effects of which are not be easily separated due to their covariance in nature.&lt;ref name=Wang2016&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jianjun | last2 = Pan | first2 = Feiyan | last3 = Soininen | first3 = Janne | last4 = Heino | first4 = Jani | last5 = Shen | first5 = Ji | title = Nutrient enrichment modifies temperature-biodiversity relationships in large-scale field experiments | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13960 | pmid = 28000677 | pmc = 5187590 | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13960 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, microcosm experimental setups in subtropical and subarctic regions (China and Norway, respectively) showed clear segregation of bacterial species along temperature gradients, and interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on biodiversity along mountain elevation gradients.&lt;ref name=Wang2016/&gt; A more expansive research program for mountain [[biogeography]] may be extremely beneficial for conservation biologists seeking to understand factors driving biodiversity in known hot spots.&lt;ref name=lomolino2001&gt;Lomolino, M. V. (2001) Elevation gradients of species-den-sity: historical and prospective views. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research and reviews are also needed to address contradictions in the scientific literature, and to identify the extent of interactions between current explanations and hypotheses.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Elocutio''' is the term for the mastery of stylistic elements in Western classical [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''loqui'', "to speak". Although the word ''elocution'' is now associated more with eloquent speaking, it connoted "style" for the classical rhetorican.

It is the third of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing. Beginning in the [[Renaissance]], writers increasingly emphasized the stylistic aspects of rhetoric over the other divisions of rhetoric.

An orator or writer had a number of things to decide in developing a style for a particular discourse. First, there was the level of style; plain (''attenuata'' or ''subtile''), middle (''mediocris'' or ''robusta''), or high (''florida'' or ''gravis''). Writers were instructed to match the basic style to their subject matter and audience. For instance, [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' deemed the plain style suitable for instruction, the middle for moving oration, and the high for charming discourse. Today, elocution and rhetoric are associated with the last of the styles, but for rhetoricians, each style was useful in rhetoric.

The ancient authors agreed that the four ingredients necessary to achieve good style included correctness, clearness, appropriateness, and ornament.

Sometimes translated as "purity," correctness meant that rhetors should use words that were current and adhered to the grammatical rules of whatever language they wrote. Correctness rules are standards of grammar and usage drawn from traditional grammar.

In regard to clarity, most ancient teachers felt that clarity meant that rhetors should use words in their ordinary or everyday senses. The object of clarity was to allow meaning to "shine through" like light through a window.

Appropriateness probably derives from the Greek rhetorical notion to ''prepon'', meaning to say or do whatever is fitting in a given situation. Ancient teachers taught that close attention to kairos will help to determine the appropriate style.

The last and most important of the excellences of style is ornament, which is defined as extraordinary or unusual use of language. Ornamentation was divided into three broad categories: figures of speech, figures of thought, and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. Figures of speech are any artful patterning or arrangement of language. Figures of thought are artful presentations of ideas, feelings, concepts and figures of thought that depart from the ordinary patterns of argument. Tropes are any artful substitution of one term for another.

A great amount of attention was paid to [[figure of speech|figures of speech]], which were classified into various types and subtypes. One Renaissance writer, [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], enumerated 184 different figures of speech, but it could be argued that it was a manifestation of the increasing overemphasis on style that began in the Renaissance.

Also important to ''elocutio'' were subjects that would now be generally regarded as grammatical: the proper use of punctuation and conjunctions; the desirable order of words in a sentence (unlike English, many languages are not as dependent on word order to establish relationships between words and so choices of word order may revolve more around form than function); and the length of sentences.

[[File:Centre Etude Polymorphisme Humain Institut Genetique Moleculaire Paris France.jpg|thumb|200px|CEPH]]
The '''Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH''' or '''CEPH''', formerly the '''Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain''' (the ''Center for the Study of Human [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Human Molecular Genetics: Mechanisms of Inherited Diseases|author=Jack J. Pasternak|publisher=Wiley|date=2005|ISBN=9780471719175}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an international genetic research center located in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It produced a map that includes genetic markers of human [[chromosomes]] using a resource of [[biological immortality|immortalised]] cell cultures.

==Background==
In his 2005 addendum to his biography for the 1980 [[Nobel Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1980/dausset-bio.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Dausset]] noted that, thanks to his Nobel Prize and a grant from the French Téléthon, he had been able in 1984 to create the Human Polymorphism Study Centre (CEPH), which soon after became Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH. Dausset founded CEPH with the collaboration of Professors Howard Cann and Daniel Cohen.

The scientific director of CEPH is currently [[Jean-François Deleuze]] and its president is [[François d'Aubert]], a French politician, an auditor at the Cour des Comptes and a former minister delegate to research.

==Human genome==
Numerous collaborators working on the same large families as Dausset had collected for his Nobel Prize-winning studies on the [[human leukocyte antigen]] system, led to the addition of numerous gene markers and made it feasible to publish the first [[genetic map]] and, later on, the first [[physical map]] of the [[human genome]].

==New resources==
An exhaustive study of human populations around the world has also produced important publications from CEPH. Besides this, DNA samples from [[sibship]]s of people over 95 years old and a bank of [[centenarian]]s now provide a valuable research resource at the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH.

'''Forensic materials engineering''', a branch of [[forensic engineering]], focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined by the nature of the material in question, be it [[metal]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]] or [[composite material|composite]]. An important aspect is the analysis of [[trace evidence]] such as [[skid mark]]s on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of [[fractography]].

==Metals and alloys==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|[[Crankshaft]] [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] fracture]]
Metal and alloy surfaces can be analyzed in a number of ways, including by [[spectroscopy]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] used during [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The nature and composition of the metal can normally be established by sectioning and polishing the bulk, and examining the flat section using [[optical microscopy]] after [[etching]] solutions have been used to provide contrast in the section between alloy constituents. Such solutions (often an [[acid]]) attack the surface preferentially, so isolating features or inclusions of one composition, enabling them to be seen much more clearly than in the polished but untreated surface. [[Metallography]] is a routine technique for examining the [[microstructure]] of metals, but can also be applied to ceramics, glasses and polymers. [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] can often be critical in  determining failures modes by examining fracture surfaces. The origin of a crack can be found and the way it grew assessed, to distinguish, for example, [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|overload]] failure from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Often however, fatigue fractures are easy to distinguish from overload failures by the lack of ductility, and the existence of a fast crack growth region and the slow crack growth area on the fracture surface. [[Crankshaft]] fatigue for example is a common failure mode for engine parts. The example shows just two such zones, the slow crack at the base, the fast at the top.

==Ceramics and glasses==
[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|left|thumb|200px| Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
Hard products like [[ceramic]] pottery and [[glass]] [[windscreen]]s can be studied using the same [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] methods used for metals, especially [[ESEM]] conducted at low vacuum. Fracture surfaces are especially valuable sources of information because surface features like hachures can enable the origin or origins of the cracks to be found. Analysis of the surface features is carried out using [[fractography]].

The position of the origin can then be matched with likely loads on the product to show how an accident occurred, for example. Inspection of bullet holes can often show the direction of travel and energy of the impact, and the way common glass products like bottles can be analysed to show whether deliberately or accidentally broken in a crime or accident. Defects such as foreign particles will often occur near or at the origin of the critical crack, and can be readily identified by [[ESEM]].

==Polymers and composites==
[[Image:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[chlorine]] attack of [[acetal resin]] plumbing joint]]
[[Thermoplastics]], [[thermosets]], and [[Composite material|composites]] can be analyzed using [[FTIR]] and [[UV spectroscopy]] as well as [[NMR]] and [[ESEM]]. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using [[microtomy]] from the solid product. The slicing method is preferable since there are no complications from solvent absorption, and the integrity of the sample is partly preserved. Fractured products can be examined using [[fractography]], an especially useful method for all fractured components using [[macrophotography]] and [[optical microscopy]]. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like [[chlorine]], present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the [[injection moulding]]s are faulty.

[[ESEM]] is especially useful for providing [[elemental analysis]] from viewed parts of the sample being investigated. It is effectively a technique of [[microanalysis]] and valuable for examination of [[trace evidence]]. On the other hand, colour rendition is absent, and there is no information provided about the way in which those elements are bonded to one another. Specimens will be exposed to a vacuum, so any volatiles may be removed, and surfaces may be contaminated by substances used to attach the sample to the mount.

==Elastomers==
[[Image:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ozone cracking in [[Natural rubber]] tubing]]
Rubber products are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents or loss of function. Failed products can be examined with many of the generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is [[vulcanized]] or [[cross-linked]]. [[Attenuated total reflectance]] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the [[selenium]] crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific [[elastomer]] used in a product. Often the best technique is [[ESEM]] using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides [[elemental analysis]], it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of [[chlorine]] indicates [[polychloroprene]] while the presence of [[nitrogen]] indicates [[nitrile rubber]]. The method is also useful in confirming [[ozone cracking]] by the large amounts of [[oxygen]] present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]] and associated [[copolymer]]s. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during [[ozonolysis]].

The problem occurs when small concentrations of [[ozone]] gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as [[O-ring]]s and [[diaphragm seal]]s. The product must be in tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.

'''Gene therapy for color blindness''' is an experimental [[gene therapy]] aiming to convert congenitally [[color blindness|colorblind]] individuals to [[trichromacy|trichromats]] by introducing a [[photopigment]] gene that they lack.  Though partial color blindness is considered only a mild disability and is controversial whether it is even a disorder, it is a condition that affects many people, [[Sex linkage|particularly males]]. Complete color blindness, or [[achromatopsia]], is very rare but more severe. While never demonstrated in humans, animal studies have shown that it is possible to confer [[color vision]] by injecting a gene of the missing photopigment using [[gene therapy]].  As of 2018 there is no medical entity offering this treatment, and no clinical trials available for volunteers.

==Color blindness==
{{Main article|Color blindness}} 





The [[retina]] of the [[human eye]] contains photoreceptive cells called [[cone cell|cones]] that allow color vision.  A normal trichromat individual possesses three different types of cones to distinguish different colors within the [[visible spectrum]] from 380&amp;nbsp;nm to 740&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29&gt;{{Cite book| editors= Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM| chapter=Ch. 29: Color Vision |title = Principles of Neural Science| year = 2000| publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional| isbn = 978-0-8385-7701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three types of cones are designated L, M, and S cones, and each type is sensitive to a certain range of wavelength of light depending on what photopigment it contains.  More specifically, the L cone absorbs around 560&amp;nbsp;nm, the M cone absorbs near 530&amp;nbsp;nm, and the S cone absorbs near 420&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;   Contrary to popular belief, the peak absorption frequency for L, M, and S cones do not exactly correspond to red, green, and blue wavelength.  Rather, the peak frequency for the L cone is orange, yellowish green in M cones, and blue-violet in S cones. These cones [[Transduction (physiology)|transduce]] the absorbed light into electrical information to be relayed to neurons in the retina such as [[Bipolar cell of the retina|retinal bipolar cells]] and [[retinal ganglion cells]], before reaching the [[human brain|brain]].&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

The signals from different cones are added or subtracted from each other to process the color of incoming light.  For instance, the color red stimulate L cones more than M cones, whereas the color green stimulates the L and M cones more than the S cones.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  The colors are perceived in an [[opponent process]], such that red and green are perceived in opposition, as are blue and yellow, black and white.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

The gene loci coding for the photopigments: M-[[opsin]] and L-opsin are located in close proximity within the [[X chromosome]] and are highly polymorphic.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  Among the population, some have a deleted gene for the M photopigment in the X chromosome (such as in deuteranopia), whereas others have a mutated form of the gene (such as in deuteranomaly).  Individuals who can express only two types of opsins in the cones are called [[Dichromacy|dichromats]].  Because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, dichromatism is much more prevalent among men.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  With only two types of cones, dichromats are less capable of distinguishing between two colors.  In the most common form of color blindness, deuteranopes have difficulty discriminating between red and green color.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  This is shown by their poor performance in [[Ishihara test]].  Although dichromatism poses little problem for daily life, dichromats may find some color-coded diagrams and maps difficult to read.

Less common forms of dichromacy include protoanopia (lack of L-cones), and tritanopia (lack of S-cones).  If a person lacks two types of photopigments, they are considered [[monochromats]]. People lacking the three types of photopigments are said to have complete color blindness or [[achromatopsia]]. Color blindness can also result from damages to the [[visual cortex]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

==Theory==
Experiments using a variety of mammals (including primates) demonstrated that it is possible to confer color vision to animals by introducing an opsin gene that the animal previously lacked.  Using a replication-defective recombinant [[adeno-associated virus]] (rAAV) as a vector, the [[cDNA]] of the opsin gene found in the L or M cones can be delivered to some fraction of the cones within the retina via subretinal injection.  Upon gaining the gene, the cone begins to express the new photopigment.  The effect of therapy lasts until the cones die or the inserted DNA is lost within the cones.

While gene therapy for humans has been ongoing with some success, a gene therapy for humans to gain color vision has not been attempted to date.  However, demonstrations using several mammals (including primates such as a squirrel monkey) suggest that the therapy should be feasible for humans as well.  It is also theoretically possible for trichromats to be "upgraded" to [[tetrachromats]] by introducing new opsin genes.

==Motivation==
The goal of the gene therapy is to make some of the cones in the retina of a dichromat individual to express the missing photopigment.  Although partial color blindness is considered to be a mild disability and even an advantage under certain circumstances (such as spotting camouflaged objects), it can pose challenges for many occupations such as Law Enforcement, Airline pilot, Railroad workers and military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldeyelasik.com/other-treatments/color-blindness-treatment.html |title=Colour blindness treatment |publisher=World Eye Centers Istanbul |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618113537/http://www.worldeyelasik.com/other-treatments/color-blindness-treatment.html |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, color codes in maps and figures may be difficult to read for individuals with color blindness.

Because only a single gene codes for a photopigment and the gene is only expressed in the retina, it is a relatively easy condition to treat using gene therapy compared to other genetic diseases.  However, there remains the question of whether the therapy is worthwhile, for an individual to undergo an invasive subretinal injection to temporarily treat a condition that is more of an inconvenience than a disorder.

However, complete color blindness, or [[achromatopsia]], is very rare but more severe. Indeed, achromats cannot see any color, have a strong [[photophobia]] (blindness in full sun), and a reduced visual acuity (generally 20/200 after correction).

Moreover, the research may have strong implications toward genetic therapy of other cone diseases.  Other cone diseases such as [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]], [[cone-rod dystrophy]], and certain types of [[maculopathy|maculopathies]] may be treatable using the same techniques as the gene therapy used for color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, J.-J., J. Alexander, et al. (2010). Achromatopsia as a Potential Candidate for Gene Therapy: 639-646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

==Research so far==
There has been ongoing research for gene therapy to treat [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]], a genetic disorder in photoreceptors that can lead to vision loss and blindness.  These treatments use AAV vector and is delivered in much the same way as the gene therapy for color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Bennicelli, J., J. F. Wright, et al. (2008). "Reversal of Blindness in Animal Models of Leber Congenital Amaurosis Using Optimized AAV2-mediated Gene Transfer." Mol Ther 16(3): 458-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, S. G. B., Sanford L.; Aleman, Tomas S.; Thomas J. Conlon, Caroline J. Zeiss, Alejandro J. Roman, Artur V. Cideciyan, Sharon B. Schwartz, Andras M. Komaromy, Michelle Doobrajh, Andy Y. Cheung, Alexander Sumaroka, Susan E. Pearce-Kelling, Gustavo D. Aguirre, Shalesh Kaushal, Albert M. Maguire, Terence R. Flotte, William W. Hauswirth. (2006). "Safety in Nonhuman Primates of Ocular AAV2-RPE65, a Candidate Treatment for Blindness in Leber Congenital Amaurosis." Human Gene Therapy 17(8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs et al. published their research in the journal: ''Science'' in 2007, on their work introducing a human L-cone photopigment in [[house mouse|mice]].  Since the mice possess only S cones and M cones, they are dichromats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, G. H., G. A. Williams, et al. (2007). "Emergence of Novel Color Vision in Mice Engineered to Express a Human Cone Photopigment." ''Science'' 315(5819): 1723-1725.&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers replaced M-opsin with a cDNA of L-opsin in the X chromosome of some mice.  By breeding these "knock-in" [[transgenic]] mice, they generated heterozygous females with both an M cone and an L cone.  These mice had improved range of color vision and have gained trichromacy, as tested by [[electroretinogram]] and behavioral tests.  However, this is more difficult to apply in the form of gene therapy.

In a paper published in the journal: ''Visual Neuroscience'' by Mauck et al., researchers used recombinant AAV vector to introduce the [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) gene in the cones of [[gerbils]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauck, M. C., K. Mancuso, et al. (2008). "Longitudinal evaluation of expression of virally delivered transgenes in gerbil cone photoreceptors." Visual Neuroscience 25(03): 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;  The genetic insert was designed to only be expressed in S or M cones, and the study observed the expression of GFP ''in vivo'' over time.  The study characterized the time of onset of expression, and also demonstrated that gene expression could stabilize if a sufficiently high dose of the viral vector is given.

Mancuso et al. published their research in the journal: ''Nature'' in 2009, on converting adult dichromat [[squirrel monkeys]] into trichromats using gene therapy.&lt;ref name=Mancuso&gt;Mancuso, K., W. W. Hauswirth, et al. (2009). "Gene therapy for red‚ and green colour blindness in adult primates." ''Nature'' 461(7265): 784-787.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[New world monkeys]] such as squirrel monkeys lack the L-opsin gene and are incapable of discriminating between certain shades of red and green.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  The researchers used recombinant AAV vector to deliver a human L-opsin gene into the monkey’s retina.  Cones that gained the missing genes began expressing the new photopigment.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

The researchers raised two possibilities if the therapy worked—that the monkeys would either remain dichromatic with greater sensitivity for longer wavelength of light, or they would become trichromats.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  Electroretinogram recordings demonstrated that they are able to discriminate blue-green from red-violet, and have indeed gained trichromacy.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  The treated monkeys were also more successful when their color vision was tested with a modified Ishihara test.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

In 2007, Alexander JJ et al.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander JJ, et al. (2007). "Restoration of cone vision in a mouse model of achromatopsia." Nat. Med. Jun;13(6):685-7. Epub 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; used gene therapy to restore some of the sight of mice with [[achromatopsia]]. The results were positive for 80% of the mice treated.
Moreover, a paper by Komáromy et al.,&lt;ref name="Komáromy"&gt;Komáromy, K., et al. (2010). "Gene therapy rescues cone function in congenital achromatopsia." Human Molecular Genetics {{doi|10.1093/hmg/ddq136}} .&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010, deals with gene therapy for a form of [[achromatopsia]] in dogs. Cone function and day vision have been restored for at least 33 months in two young dogs with achromatopsia. However, this therapy was less efficient for older dogs.

==Theoretical questions==
According to research by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]], suturing shut one eye of monkeys at an early age resulted in an irreversible [[ocular dominance|loss of vision]] in that eye, even after the suture was removed.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Hubel, T. N. Wiesel, and S. LeVay. Plasticity of Ocular Dominance Columns in Monkey Striate CortexPhil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B April 26, 1977 278:377-409; {{doi|10.1098/rstb.1977.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concluded that the [[neural circuitry]] for vision is wired during a "critical period" in childhood, after which the visual circuitry can no longer be rewired to process new sensory input.  Contrary to this finding, Mancuso et al.’s success in conferring trichromacy to adult squirrel monkeys suggests that it is possible to adapt the preexisting circuit to allow greater acuity in color vision.  The researchers concluded that integrating the stimulus from the new photopigment as an adult was not analogous to vision loss following visual deprivation.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

It is yet unknown how the animals that gain a new photopigment are perceiving the new color.  While the article by Mancuso et al. states that the monkey has indeed gained trichromacy and gained the ability to discriminate between red and green, they claim no knowledge of how the animal internally perceives the sensation.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

While red/green color blindness among deuteranopes can be treated by introducing M-opsin genes, rarer forms of color blindness such as tritanopia can in principle be treated as well.  For tritanopia, the S-opsin gene must be introduced instead of M-opsin gene.

==Challenges==
Despite the success in animals, there still remain challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans for treating color blindness.

===Safety===
How to deliver the viral vector into the retina is probably the main obstacle to making gene therapy a practical treatment for color blindness.  Because the virus has to be injected directly by using a needle to penetrate the [[sclera]] of the eye, the treatment may be highly unpleasant and is a risk for eye infection.  Without a way to deliver the virus noninvasively, the treatment is rather risky for the benefit gained.

It is not known yet how frequently the gene needs to be injected to maintain trichromacy among congenitally colorblind individuals.  At the time of publication, Mancuso et al. reports that the treated squirrel monkeys have maintained 2 years of color vision after the treatment.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  If repeat injections are needed, there is also the concern of the body developing an immune reaction to the virus.  If a body develops sensitivity to the viral vector, the success of the therapy could be jeopardized and/or the body may respond unfavorably. An editorial by J. Bennett points to Mancuso et al.'s use of an "unspecified postinjection corticosteroid therapy".&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett J. Gene Therapy for Color Blindness. N Engl J Med. 17 December 2009, 2009;361(25):2483-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bennett suggests that the monkeys may have experienced inflammation due to the injection.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;  However, the AAV virus that is commonly used for this study is non-pathogenic, and the body is less likely to develop an immune reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Grieger JC, Samulski RJ (2005). "Adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector: vector development, production and clinical applications". Advances in Biochemical Engineering/biotechnology 99: 119–45. {{doi|10.1007/10_005}}. {{PMID|16568890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, an extensive review of the safety of the treatment must precede any human trials.

The subject should first be evaluated to identify which photopigment they need to gain trichromacy.  Also, while gene therapy may treat congenital color blindness (such as dichromacy), it is not intended to treat non-retinal forms of color blindness such as damage to the visual cortex of the brain.

===Ethics===
As a way to introduce new genetic information to change a person’s phenotype, a gene therapy for color blindness is open to the same [[Gene therapy#Problems and ethics|ethical questions]] and criticisms as gene therapy in general.  Given the large number of people with color blindness, there is also the question of whether color blindness is a disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan MJ, Adam A, Mollon JD. "Dichromats detect colour-camouflaged objects that are not detected by trichromats." ''Proc Biol Sci.'' 22 June 1992;248 (1323):291-5. {{PMID|1354367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, even if gene therapy succeeds in converting incomplete colorblind individuals to trichromats, the degree of satisfaction among the subjects is unknown. It is uncertain how the quality of life will improve (or worsen) after the therapy.

'''Himiko''' is a [[interstellar cloud|large gas cloud]] found at [[redshift]] of z=6.6 that predates similar [[Lyman-alpha blob]]s. At time of discovery, researchers said it "may represent the most massive object ever discovered in the early universe."&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090422-space-blob.html|title=Giant Mystery Blob Discovered Near Dawn of Time|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|date=2009-04-22|publisher=[[SPACE.com]]|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]] at [[redshift]] z=6.595, about 12.9 billion [[light years]] from Earth, or about {{val|75|e=21}} miles ({{val|122|e=21}} kilometers).

==Characteristics==
This nebular gas cloud is thought to be a [[protogalaxy]], caught in the act of formation. There have been no spectroscopic signatures of anything other than hydrogen or helium, and its luminance cannot be ascribed to gravitational lensing, black holes or exterior excitation. The lack of any chemical signatures other than hydrogen and helium illustrate the extreme primitiveness of the object, and early enough so as not to be polluted by carbon signatures from young stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116113517.htm |title= Astronomers Probe the Primitive Nature of a Distant 'Space Blob' |date= 16 January 2014 |publisher= [[Science Daily]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
It is 55,000 light years across (half the diameter of our galaxy), and at the time of discovery, said to "hold more than 10 times as much mass as the next largest object found in the early universe, or roughly the equivalent mass of 40 billion Suns".&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

==Discovery==
Masami Ouchi, a researcher at the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena, California, stated "I have never heard about any [similar] objects that could be resolved at this distance...[i]t's kind of record-breaking."

==Name==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11201">'''Human-computer information retrieval''' ('''HCIR''') is the study and engineering of [[information retrieval]] techniques that bring human intelligence into the [[search engine|search]] process. It combines the fields of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and information retrieval (IR) and creates systems that improve search by taking into account the human context, or through a multi-step search process that provides the opportunity for human feedback.

== History ==

This term ''human–computer information retrieval'' was coined by [[Gary Marchionini]] in a series of lectures delivered between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name=march2006&gt;[http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Jun-06/marchionini.html Marchionini, G. (2006). Toward Human-Computer Information Retrieval Bulletin, in June/July 2006 Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Marchionini’s main thesis is that "HCIR aims to empower people to explore large-scale information bases but demands that people also take responsibility for this control by expending cognitive and physical energy."

In 1996 and 1998, a pair of workshops at the [[University of Glasgow]] on [[information retrieval]] and [[human–computer interaction]] sought to address the overlap between these two fields. Marchionini notes the impact of the [[World Wide Web]] and the sudden increase in [[information literacy]] – changes that were only embryonic in the late 1990s.

A few workshops have focused on the intersection of IR and HCI. The Workshop on Exploratory Search, initiated by the [[University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab]] in 2005, alternates between the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval]] (SIGIR) and [[CHI (conference)|Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction]] (CHI) conferences. Also in 2005, the [[European Science Foundation]] held an Exploratory Workshop on Information Retrieval in Context. Then, the first Workshop on Human Computer Information Retrieval was held in 2007 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

== Description ==

HCIR includes various aspects of IR and HCI. These include [[exploratory search]], in which users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation; information retrieval in context (i.e., taking into account aspects of the user or environment that are typically not reflected in a query); and interactive information retrieval, which Peter Ingwersen defines as "the interactive communication processes that occur during the retrieval of information by involving all the major participants in information retrieval (IR), i.e. the user, the intermediary, and the IR system."&lt;ref name=ingwer1992&gt;[http://vip.db.dk/pi/iri/index.htm Ingwersen, P. (1992). Information Retrieval Interaction. London: Taylor Graham.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key concern of HCIR is that IR systems intended for human users be implemented and evaluated in a way that reflects the needs of those users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mira working group (1996). Evaluation Frameworks for Interactive Multimedia Information Retrieval Applications |url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mira/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201153227/http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mira/ |archivedate=2008-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern IR systems employ a [[ranking|ranked]] retrieval model, in which the documents are scored based on the [[probability]] of the document's [[relevance]] to the query.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, D. and Frieder, O. (2004). Information Retrieval Algorithms and Heuristics. &lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the system only presents the top-ranked documents to the user. This systems are typically evaluated based on their [[Information retrieval#Average precision of precision and recall|mean average precision]] over a set of benchmark queries from organizations like the [[Text Retrieval Conference]] (TREC).

Because of its emphasis in using human intelligence in the information retrieval process, HCIR requires different evaluation models – one that combines evaluation of the IR and HCI components of the system. A key area of research in HCIR involves evaluation of these systems. Early work on interactive information retrieval, such as Juergen Koenemann and [[Nicholas J. Belkin]]'s 1996 study of different levels of interaction for automatic query reformulation, leverage the standard IR measures of [[Information retrieval#Precision|precision]] and [[Information retrieval#Recall|recall]] but apply them to the results of multiple iterations of user interaction, rather than to a single query response.&lt;ref name=koene1996&gt;[http://prior.sigchi.org/chi96/proceedings/papers/Koenemann/jk1_txt.htm Koenemann, J. and Belkin, N. J. (1996). A case for interaction: a study of interactive information retrieval behavior and effectiveness. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Common Ground (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, April 13–18, 1996). M. J. Tauber, Ed. CHI '96. ACM Press, New York, NY, 205-212]&lt;/ref&gt; Other HCIR research, such as Pia Borlund's IIR evaluation model, applies a methodology more reminiscent of HCI, focusing on the characteristics of users, the details of experimental design, etc.&lt;ref name=borlund2003&gt;[http://informationr.net/ir/8-3/paper152.html Borlund, P. (2003). The IIR evaluation model: a framework for evaluation of interactive information retrieval systems. Information Research, 8(3), Paper 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
HCIR researchers have put forth the following goals towards a system where the user has more control in determining relevant results.&lt;ref name=march2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ipm2013&gt;[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2504017 White, R., Capra, R., Golovchinsky, G., Kules, B., Smith, C., and Tunkelang, D. (2013). Introduction to Special Issue on Human-computer Information Retrieval. Journal of Information Processing and Management 49(5), 1053-1057]&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems should
*no longer only deliver the relevant documents, but must also provide semantic information along with those documents
*increase user responsibility as well as control; that is, information systems require human intellectual effort
*have flexible architectures so they may evolve and adapt to increasingly more demanding and knowledgeable user bases
*aim to be part of information ecology of personal and [[Collective memory|shared memories]] and tools rather than discrete standalone services
*support the entire information life cycle (from creation to preservation) rather than only the dissemination or use phase
*support tuning by end users and especially by information professionals who add value to information resources
*be engaging and fun to use

In short, information retrieval systems are expected to operate in the way that good libraries do. Systems should help users to bridge the gap between data or information (in the very narrow, granular sense of these terms) and knowledge (processed data or information that provides the context necessary to inform the next iteration of an information seeking process). That is, good libraries provide both the information a patron needs as well as a partner in the learning process — the [[information professional]] — to navigate that information, make sense of it, preserve it, and turn it into knowledge (which in turn creates new, more informed information needs).

== Techniques ==

The techniques associated with HCIR emphasize representations of information that use human intelligence to lead the user to relevant results. These techniques also strive to allow users to explore and digest the dataset without penalty, i.e., without expending unnecessary costs of time, mouse clicks, or context shift.

Many [[search engines]] have features that incorporate HCIR techniques. [[Spelling suggestion]]s and [[query expansion|automatic query reformulation]] provide mechanisms for suggesting potential search paths that can lead the user to relevant results. These suggestions are presented to the user, putting control of selection and interpretation in the user’s hands.

[[Faceted search]] enables users to navigate information [[hierarchy|hierarchically]], going from a category to its sub-categories, but choosing the order in which the categories are presented. This contrasts with traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. [[Faceted classification|Faceted navigation]], like taxonomic navigation, guides users by showing them available categories (or facets), but does not require them to browse through a hierarchy that may not precisely suit their needs or way of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst, M. (1999). User Interfaces and Visualization, Chapter 10 of Baeza-Yates, R. and Ribeiro-Neto, B., Modern Information Retrieval.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorial search#Lookahead|Lookahead]] provides a general approach to penalty-free exploration. For example, various [[web applications]] employ [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] to automatically complete query terms and suggest popular searches. Another common example of lookahead is the way in which search engines annotate results with summary information about those results, including both static information (e.g., [[metadata]] about the objects) and "snippets" of document text that are most pertinent to the words in the search query.

[[Relevance feedback]] allows users to guide an IR system by indicating whether particular results are more or less relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, J. (1971). Relevance feedback in information retrieval. In: Salton, G (ed), The SMART Retrieval System.&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarization and [[analytics]] help users digest the results that come back from the query. Summarization here is intended to encompass any means of [[aggregate data|aggregating]] or [[data compression|compressing]] the query results into a more human-consumable form. Faceted search, described above, is one such form of summarization. Another is [[cluster analysis|clustering]], which analyzes a set of documents by grouping similar or co-occurring documents or terms. Clustering allows the results to be partitioned into groups of related documents. For example, a search for "java" might return clusters for [[Java (programming language)]], [[Java|Java (island)]], or [[Java (coffee)]].

[[information visualization|Visual representation of data]] is also considered a key aspect of HCIR. The representation of summarization or analytics may be displayed as tables, charts, or summaries of aggregated data. Other kinds of [[information visualization]] that allow users access to summary views of search results include [[tag clouds]] and [[treemapping]].

'''Irruptive growth''', sometimes called '''Malthusian growth''', is a growth pattern over time, defined by [[Human overpopulation|population explosions]] and subsequent sharp population crashes, or diebacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Population Genetics and Evolutionary Ecology|first=J.|last= Roughgarden|authorlink=Joan Roughgarden|year=1996|publisher= Prentice-Hall, Inc.|isbn=0-13-441965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension of the [[Malthusian growth model]], specifically the growth pattern that causes a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], and can occur when populations overshoot their [[carrying capacity]], a phenomenon typically associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]]. Populations which exhibit irruptive growth do not stabilize around their carrying capacity, a feature of [[logistic function|logistic growth]]. Irruptive growth occurs when a species reproduces more rapidly than the environment is capable of supporting with the available resources.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate= 26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irruptive growth is studied in [[population ecology]].

An '''irruption''' is any sudden change in the population density of an organism.

==K-strategist and r-strategist species==
{{main|r/K selection theory}}
r-strategist species (species that evolve according to r-selection) are characterized by rapid development, early reproduction, small body size, and shorter lifespans, whereas [[r/K selection theory|K-strategist]] species (species that evolve according to K-selection) exhibit slow development, delayed reproduction, large body size, and longer lifespans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Ecology: First Principles|author=John H. Vandermeer and Deborah E. Goldberg|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the main two [[evolution]]ary strategies for ensuring the continuation of the species by passing down its [[Genetics|genetic code]]. 

r-strategist species have variable population sizes and are more likely to exhibit irruptive growth than K-strategist species, whose populations are usually constant and remain at or close to the carrying capacity of the environment. r-selection leads to high productivity, while K-selection leads to high efficiency. Productivity refers to the number of offspring produced, whereas efficiency refers to the quality and the probability of survival of individual offspring. 

The [[Human|human species]] is K-strategist; that is, each mating pair has a small number of offspring, of which the majority will survive to adulthood and reach reproductive age. Reproductive age is later in life for K-strategists. r-strategist species, such as some [[insect]]s, have very large numbers of offspring, the majority of which will die before reaching physical maturity. If there is a change in their environment, more of these offspring may survive than is typical, leading to irruptive growth. 

Because of these differences in the number of offspring produced between K- and r-strategists, K-strategist species are more likely to have stable populations and less likely to exhibit irruptive growth.

==Malthusian growth==
{{main|Malthusian growth model}}
One exception to the general rule of K-strategists being less likely to exhibit irruptive growth is people. As Thomas Malthus described in his essay on the [[An Essay on the Principle of Population|Principle of Population]], human overpopulation is a serious issue, and one which can only become more pressing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Essay on the Principle of Population|author=Thomas Malthus|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our advanced mental capacity, humans have succeeded in maximizing the carrying capacity of the environment through the invention of higher-yielding crops and transportation to get food from where it is produced to where it is needed for consumption&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11520695 |title=The Malthus Blues|accessdate=26 September 2011 | work=The Economist|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the world's population continues to rise, and the capacity of the current food supply to adequately provide for all the people on earth is called ever more into doubt. Thus, we may become one of the few K-strategist species to experience a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

==In mammal populations==
Populations of some species tend to initially show a lack of response to density-dependent factors that limit population size as it nears carrying capacity. The exhibition of Malthusian growth is dependent on a number of elements including resource availability, degree of both interspecific and intraspecific competition, and strength of [[predator-prey]] relationships.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irruptive growth patterns are seen in a few mammal species, often in specific locations, and they are usually herbivores with relatively small body size. In cases where a single herbivore prey species is dominant in an ecosystem, there is likely to be a strong link with predator species, which serves to prevent un-checked population growth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing predator-prey theory by studying fluctuating populations of small mammals|author=S. Boutin|year=1995|journal=Wildl. Res.|volume=22|pp=89–100 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.575.6975&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.575.6975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits and house mice of Australia tend to show irruptive growth, likely because when a drought ends, they reproduce at a rapid rate and continue to breed at that rate while predator reproduction is still seasonal in occurrence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; This allows for the population to explode and to be limited more by a return of dry conditions than by predators.

Larger herbivores like [[pronghorn]] and [[Cervidae|deer]] are also known to exhibit irruptive growth; this occurs in populations with high reproduction and delayed density dependent inhibition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; The time that a species is most likely to irrupt in population growth is when a population is first inhabiting an area or when predators are first removed, and both weather and food supplies are in the species' favor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; When an area is being colonized, populations of species can grow rapidly and predator species are often not present to limit growth. Resource availability is not an issue either for colonizing populations, which will also experience little intraspecific and interspecific competition in early settlement of a location.

Similar to white-tailed deer in North America, roe deer in European locations have shown increases in abundance even in the face of already extremely high densities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Irruptive potential in roe deer: Density-dependent effects on body mass and fertility|author=R. Andersen |author2=D. C. L. John|year=2000|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|volume= 64|issue=3|pp=698–706|doi=10.2307/3802739|jstor=3802739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer are able to irrupt and continue to increase in density over their carrying capacity because in particular areas especially, populations show delayed response to density dependent factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;  The mammal species that exhibit Malthusian growth are the ones that, under certain conditions, act more like r-strategists than K-strategists compared to surrounding populations.

'''Lucideon (formerly Ceram)''' is an independent materials development, testing and assurance company based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and in the US. Lucideon owns testing facilities around the world.

==History==
The British Refractories Research Association was formed in 1920. The pottery industry was required by the [[Import Duties Act 1932|Import Duties Advisory Committee]] in 1937 to create a [[research association]], so the British Pottery Research Association was formed in 1937. The two combined in April 1948 as the '''British Ceramic Research Association'''.

The main building on Queens Road in [[Penkhull]] was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in December 1951. In May 1986 it changed its name to British Ceramic Research Ltd, having been incorporated as a company on 18 November 1985.

From the late 1990s the company traded under the abbreviated name Ceram. On 1 February 2014 the company name changed to Lucideon Limited.

==Structure==
Lucideon is situated south of the [[University Hospital of North Staffordshire]].

Lucideon incorporates:
* [https://www.lucideon.com UK Headquarters] - (formerly CERAM Research Ltd)
* [https://www.lucideon.com/assurance Assurance Services] - Lucideon CICS Limited
* [https://www.lucideon.com US Laboratories] - (formerly M+P Labs) based in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]] and offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]

Lucideon's laboratories and techniques are accredited by the [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS).

==Function==
Lucideon provides materials development, technologies, consultancy and testing and analysis to a diverse range of industries; principally healthcare, construction, ceramics, aerospace, nuclear and power generation.

''[[Siglo Veintiuno]]'', one of the biggest newspapers in Guatemala, chose him as the person of the year in 2009. In 2011, [[Foreign Policy Magazine]] in Spanish named him the most influential intellectual of Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los 10 nuevos rostros del pensiamento iberoamericano|url=http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=FP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529100941/http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|archivedate=29 May 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Ahn's early research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis von Ahn|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=luis+von+ahn|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in the field of [[cryptography]]. With Nicholas J. Hopper and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]], he was the first to provide rigorous definitions of [[steganography]] and to prove that private-key steganography is possible.

In 2000, he did early pioneering work with [[Manuel Blum]] on CAPTCHAs,&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis; Blum, Manuel; Hopper, Nicholas J.; Langford, John (May 2003). "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; computer-generated tests that humans are routinely able to pass but that computers have not yet mastered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Blum | first2 = M. | last3 = Langford | first3 = J. | doi = 10.1145/966389.966390 | title = Telling humans and computers apart automatically | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices are used by web sites to prevent automated programs, or bots, from perpetrating large-scale abuse, such as automatically registering for large numbers of accounts or purchasing huge numbers of tickets for resale by scalpers. CAPTCHAs brought von Ahn his first widespread fame among the general public due to their coverage in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' and on the [[Discovery Channel]], [[NOVA scienceNOW]], and other mainstream outlets.

Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis, completed in 2005, was the first publication to use the term "[[Human-based computation|human computation]]" that he had coined, referring to methods that combine human brainpower with computers to solve problems that neither could solve alone. Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis is also the first work on [[Game with a purpose|Games With A Purpose]], or GWAPs, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as a side effect. The most famous example is the [[ESP Game]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Dabbish | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1145/985692.985733 | chapter = Labeling images with a computer game | title = Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '04 | pages = 319–326 | year = 2004 | isbn = 1581137028 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; an online game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | title = Games with a Purpose | doi = 10.1109/MC.2006.196 | journal = Computer | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 92–94 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which two randomly paired people are simultaneously shown the same picture, with no way to communicate. Each then lists a number of words or phrases that describe the picture within a time limit, and are rewarded with points for a match. This match turns out to be an accurate description of the picture, and can be successfully used in a database for more accurate image search technology. The ESP Game was licensed by Google in the form of the [[Google Image Labeler]], and is used to improve the accuracy of the [[Google Image Search]]. Von Ahn's games brought him further coverage in the mainstream media. His thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
In July 2006, von Ahn gave a tech talk at Google on "Human Computation" (i.e., crowdsourcing) which was watched by over one million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx082gDwGcM Google Tech Talk on human computation by Luis von Ahn]. youtube.com (2006-07-26). Retrieved on 2015-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, von Ahn invented [[reCAPTCHA]], a new form of [[CAPTCHA]] that also helps digitize books. In reCAPTCHA, the images of words displayed to the user come directly from old books that are being digitized; they are words that [[optical character recognition]] could not identify and are sent to people throughout the web to be identified. ReCAPTCHA is currently in use by over 100,000 web sites and is transcribing over 40 million words per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/techtonicshifts/archive/2009/11/13/recaptcha-a-k-a-those-infernal-squiggly-words-almost-done-digitizing-the-new-york-times-archive.aspx reCAPTCHA (a.k.a.

Retrieved on 2012-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; which is awarded every three years to a junior faculty member of unusual promise in the School of Computer Science.

In 2018, von Ahn was awarded the [[Lemelson-MIT Program|Lemelson-MIT]] prize for his "dedication to improving the world through technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://triblive.com/local/allegheny/14071844-74/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-wins-500k-lemelson-prize-from-mit|title=Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn wins $500K Lemelson prize from MIT|last=Federoff|first=Stacey|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Marine Institute (Foras na Mara)''' is the national agency responsible to the Irish government for advice on and implementation of marine research, technology, development and innovation policy, and marine research services.  Its official vision is of &lt;br /&gt;''“A thriving maritime economy in harmony with the ecosystem and supported by the delivery of excellence in our services."''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Locations==
The institute is headquartered at Rinville, near [[Oranmore]], [[County Galway]] while its [http://www.imdo.ie/imdo/, ''Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)''] is located in Harcourt Street, Dublin. The Marine Institute also operates an [[aquaculture]] and catchment management laboratory and office facility at Furnace, near [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]], [[County Mayo]], as well as offices and laboratories in a number of Ireland's fishing ports.

==Vessels==
The Marine Institute oversees the operation of Ireland's two purpose-built research vessels, the [[RV Celtic Explorer]] and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] and the [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''] as well as co-ordinating Sea Change – a seven-year Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007 – 2013.

==History==
[[Image:Marine Institute Headquarters Galway.jpg|thumb|The Marine Institute Headquarters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfo6 jx5LZ0], Rinville, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland]]
Following the recommendation of the 1974 National Science Council report ''Ireland, Science and the Sea'', the Marine Institute was established by the Irish government under the Marine Institute Act of 1991
''to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services that, in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment and protect the marine environment''.

Starting with the appointment of its chief executive officer – Dr Peter Heffernan – followed by four Programme Managers in Marine Environment, Marine Food, Marine Technology and Marine Leisure and Tourism in 1995, the Marine Institute grew rapidly, to include the Irish Marine Data Centre and existing marine research facilities at Abbotstown, County Dublin and the Salmon Research Agency at Newport.

1998 saw the arrival of Ireland's first purpose-built research vessel, the 31-metre long [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. This was followed in 2000 by the announcement that the Institute would be moving from Dublin to new premises in Galway, and the arrival of the larger 65-metre deepwater research vessel [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] in 2002. The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Deepwater Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''], was delivered in 2008.

2006 saw the Marine Institute move into its purpose-built headquarters and laboratory complex at Rinville, Oranmore, Galway. This building, which has won several architectural awards, houses 54 dedicated research laboratories, an auditorium capable of seating 150 people, a marine science library and an office crescent.

In 2006 the Institute also embarked on the planning and execution of Sea Change-A Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007–2013, aimed at applying state-of-the-art technology and innovation to the sustainable economic development of Ireland's oceans and seas in such a way as to increase their economic return from an annual €3 billion in 2007 to €4.5 billion by the end of the programme.

==Staff and structure==
The Marine Institute employs approximately 180 staff including specialists in fisheries, marine environment, technology, aquaculture, catchment management, ocean energy, functional foods and marine climate change, as well as experts in information technology, communications and logistical support.

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/aboutus/organisationstaff/OfficeoftheCEO.htm Office of the CEO] provides overall direction and co-ordination of foresight, strategic and research planning activities at national and international level. It works in association with the Marine Institute's five service areas and other national and international organisations.  The service areas are:

===Marine Environment and Food Safety Services (MEFS)===
[[Image:Environmental Food Symbol.jpg|thumb|Marine Environment and Food Safety Services(MEFS)Logo]]

Marine Environment &amp; Food Safety Services (MEFS) provides essential scientific advice and a range of marine [[environmental monitoring]] services to help ensure Irish [[seafood products]] meet approved standards. It also provides expert integrated advice to, and on behalf of, government departments and agencies, including the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine], [http://www.environ.ie/en/ Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government], and [http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/ the Department of Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources].

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishhealth/ '''Fish Health Team'''] works with the marine food industry to protect the health status of Irish farmed salmon, trout and shellfish. The Fish Health Unit is the Irish National Reference Laboratory for finfish, mollusc and crustacean diseases. The team tests aquatic animal samples, as required under EU and national legislation, and supports the aquaculture industry and the inland fisheries sector in maintaining Ireland's superior fish and shellfish health status. The Fish Health Unit is also the National Competent Authority for the implementation of aquatic animal health legislation under EU and national legislation and monitors the movement of finfish and shellfish into and within Ireland.

[http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/seafood/ '''Food Safety Monitoring'''] ensures that Irish marine fish, shellfish and seafood products remain safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. The programmes in this area include monitoring of Irish fish, shellfish and seafood products to assure that they are safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. This complies with a range of EU Directives as well as with national requirements. The programme monitors naturally occurring species of plankton and the toxins they produce which can be concentrated in filter-feeding shellfish. This information is provided directly to the seafood industry to allow harvesting. Research is also carried out on developing new methods of testing for identifying emerging phytoplankton species and ensuring that they can be identified and analysed effectively, and also monitoring of microbiological contaminants in shellfish.

The Marine Institute runs a national [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/data/Habs+Search+Database/ '''Harmful Algal Bloom (HABS)]''' monitoring service that warns producers and consumers of concentrations of toxic plankton in Irish coastal waters that could contaminate shellfish or cause fish deaths.

'''Environmental Monitoring''' is designed to assess levels, distribution and trends of man-made contaminants and naturally occurring biotoxins. Pollution may adversely affect the health of the seas and ultimately limit man's ability, or that of future generations, to use the seas as a sustainable resource.

The '''Aquaculture &amp; Rearing''' teams located in Galway and Newport provide research, monitoring, analyses and advice on finfish aquaculture, salmonid rearing and freshwater catchment studies. The team also implements the National Sea Lice Monitoring programme on behalf of the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine].

The Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services unit researches, assesses and advises on the sustainable exploitation of the marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland, and on the impacts of fisheries on the ecosystem. Irish waters contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. These waters are important fish spawning and nursery grounds and their [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishstock/Biologically+Sensitive+Area.htm ‘Biological Sensitivity ’] is recognised internationally. To ensure the sustainable exploitation of this valuable fisheries resource and to protect the sensitive habitats in which they live, fisheries science is becoming a more 'broader based' science that will link into the concept of 'ocean management' and not just 'fisheries management'.

Linking fisheries data with '''oceanographic''', '''sea bed mapping''' and '''climate change data''', examining predator prey relationships, and interacting with stakeholders are all important components of a new form of 'ocean management advice' which comes under the umbrella of the 'ecosystem approach'. This approach considers all marine related activities such as fishing, gravel extraction and leisure use in a specific area (e.g. [[Irish Sea|the Irish Sea]]) and provides advice in this context. Much of the work of the unit in this area is also used as input to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which seeks to ensure Ireland's marine area achieves a good environmental status by 2020.

Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services are charged with meeting Ireland's obligations under the EU Data Collection Framework. The Framework supports the scientific advice needed to underpin the Common Fisheries Policy. As such, the unit carries out [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/fisheries/ '''fisheries surveys'''] in the waters around Ireland using the research vessels [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] &lt;br /&gt; and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. These surveys collect extensive data for both national and international stock assessments of the main commercial species of fish and shellfish. Survey work is also conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels and unit staff collect data on the age and length profile of landings and examine fleet activity and fishing patterns. This information is used to produce the annual [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/publications/The+Stock+Book/ '''‘Stock Book’'''] which is the primary source of scientific advice on marine fisheries to the Irish Government and the Industry and is used to support fisheries negotiations with the [[European Union]].

Participation in '''applied research projects''' is critical to the evolution of scientific advice. The unit's flagship research project is the Beaufort Ecosystem Project, that links the third level sector on a broad range of ecosystem projects including fisheries seal interactions, marine birds, cetaceans, size based modelling and stakeholder engagement. Unit staff are also co-supervising a range of PhD projects and are active partners in many EU funded research projects.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research''' was founded in [[Müncheberg]], Germany in 1928 as part of the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft]]. The founding director, [[Erwin Baur]], initiated breeding programmes with fruits and berries, and basic research on ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'' and the domestication of [[lupin]]s. After the Second World War, the institute moved west to [[Voldagsen]], and was relocated to new buildings on the present site in [[Cologne]] in 1955. 

·The modern era of the Institute began in 1978 with the appointment of [[Jeff Schell]] and the development of plant transformation technologies and plant [[molecular genetics]]. The focus on molecular genetics was extended in 1980 with the appointment of Heinz Saedler. The appointment in 1983 of Klaus Hahlbrock broadened the expertise of the Institute in the area of plant biochemistry, and the arrival of Francesco Salamini in 1985 added a focus on crop genetics. During the period 1978-1990, the Institute was greatly expanded and new buildings were constructed for the departments led by Schell, Hahlbrock and Salamini, in addition to a new lecture hall and the [[Max Delbrück]] Laboratory building that housed independent research groups over a period of 10 years.

A new generation of directors was appointed from 2000 with the approaching retirements of Klaus Hahlbrock and Jeff Schell. [[Paul Schulze-Lefert]] and [[George Coupland]] were appointed in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and [[Maarten Koornneef]] arrived three years later upon the retirement of Francesco Salamini. The new scientific departments brought a strong focus on utilising model species to understand the regulatory principles and molecular mechanisms underlying selected traits. The longer-term aim is to translate these discoveries to breeding programmes through the development of rational breeding concepts. The arrival of a new generation of Directors also required modernisation of the infrastructure. So far, this has involved complete refurbishment of the building that houses the Plant Developmental Biology laboratory (2004), construction of a new guesthouse and library (2005), planning of new buildings for the administration and technical workshops (2009), and a new laboratory building completed in May 2012. The new laboratory building includes a section that links the three scientific departments, offices and the Bioinformatics Research Group.

{{Asof|May 2015}}, the institute had four scientific departments: Department of Plant Developmental Biology (George Coupland), Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics (Maarten Koornneef), Department of Plant Microbe Interactions (Paul Schulze-Lefert), and Department of Comparative Development and Genetics ([[Miltos Tsiantis]]), and a number of independent research groups.

== Graduate program ==
Beginning in 1999 the [[Max Planck Society]] initiated the implementation of International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) as a new way to cooperate with partner universities in Germany. The intention of this ambitious plan is twofold. On the one hand, the [[Max Planck Society]] tries to intensify the collaboration with university affiliated research groups and faculty at home. On the other hand, due to the great demand of junior scientists, one was trying to attract qualified students from Germany and abroad to help train a new generation of scientists. It seemed reasonable to combine scientific leadership and technical expertise on a local scale by jointly offering this new way to train promising scientists from around the world. The Ph.D. program provides a true interdisciplinary approach for highly motivated students to receive a Ph.D. degree and to participate in cutting edge research. Major changes and adjustments were necessary to put this idea into reality. First, because of the international character, teaching and practical training had to be offered in English to make the program attractive for foreign students. Second, the training should target a very specific area of research for which the existing faculty is internationally known. Third, the research schools are intended to represent centres of excellence. The IMPRS at the Max Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Research together with the [[University of Cologne]] represent such a centre of excellence in the area of molecular plant science, and was formed in 2001. Currently,{{when|date=October 2014}} this IMPRS has about 40 Ph.D. students, where half come from countries outside of Germany. Admission is entirely linked to scientific merit and achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4463">There are three [[metropolitan planning organization]]s (MPO) in New Jersey. The organizations are the main decision-making forums for selecting projects for the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) in deliberations involving the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), the [[New Jersey Transit Corporation]] (NJT), county and municipal transportation planners and engineers, other transportation implementing agencies, the public and elected officials at the state, county, and municipal levels.&lt;ref name = NJDOT&gt;{{Cite web   | last =    | first =    | authorlink =    | coauthors =    | title = STIP   | work =    | publisher = New Jersey Department of Transportation   | date = 2007   | url = http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/capital/stip0918/pdf/stip_vol1.pdf   | format =    | doi =    | accessdate = 2011-05-19   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state’s three MPO are:

*The [[North Jersey Transportation Planning  Authority]] (NJTPA), MPO ID# 34198200, includes [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon]], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]],  [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Ocean County|Ocean]], [[Passaic County|Passaic]], [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union]], and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] counties in the [[Gateway Region]], [[Skylands Region]], and on northern [[Jersey Shore]].
*The [[Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission]] (DVRPC), MPO ID# 42196501, includes [[Burlington County|Burlington]], [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester]] and [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]] counties in New Jersey as well [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Monthomery]], and [[Philadelphia]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[Delaware Valley]]
*The South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization (SJTPO),  MPO ID# 34199300, covering [[Atlantic County|Atlantic]], [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] and [[Salem County|Salem]] counties in [[South Jersey]].

Projects that are identified as potential candidates for inclusion in the regional 
transportation improvement programs of each of the three MPOs are subject to 
intensive screening to verify project scope, status, schedule, and cost.  The resulting “pool”
of projects is analyzed independently by NJDOT, NJ TRANSIT, and the MPOs to assign 
each project a priority based on the extent to which it would advance identified regional and 
statewide objectives, such as objectives set forth in the state and regional long-range 
transportation plans, the New Jersey Capital Investment Strategy, air quality objectives, and 
the broad social and economic goals of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.&lt;ref name = NJDOT/&gt;
  
NJDOT develops and circulates revenue projections for planning purposes to each of the 
MPOs, based on the best current assessment of available state, federal, and other funds.  
NJDOT, NJ TRANSIT and each of the three MPOs after intensive discussions and forums
negotiate a list of deliverable transportation projects that best fit the composite statewide and 
regional priorities within a financially constrained program.&lt;ref name = NJDOT/&gt;

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

The '''Mycenaean chamber tomb''' is the type of [[chamber tomb]] that was built by ancient [[Mycenaeans]]. This form of mortuary architecture was in use in the Late [[Bronze Age]] in the areas under the cultural influence of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]].  

The tombs are cut from rock and have a tripartite structure (chamber, ''stomion'' and ''dromos''), often with additional niches and side chambers in which primary or secondary burials took place. Extensive cemeteries have been found in every part of Greece having [[Mycenae]]an influences, including the islands. Such tombs were also built in parts of ancient [[Anatolia]]. For about 500 years from 1600 BC to 1100 BC they were the most widespread of mortuary structures.

'''Nesting behaviour''' refers to an instinct or urge in [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] animals caused by the increase of [[Estradiol|estradiol (E2)]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meurisse, J.

In these cases the behaviour is more for temperature control [[Thermoregulation|(thermoregulation]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

==In animals==
Female [[dog]]s may show signs of nesting behaviour about one week before they’re due&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kustritz, M|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64|pages=734–746|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include pacing and building a nest with items from around the house such as blankets, [[clothing]], and stuffed animals. Things which are able to be laundered or are disposable should be made available to the dam. Items which can be ingested by the dam should be placed out of reach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (They also sometimes do this in cases of [[false pregnancy]], or pseudocyesis). [[Domestic cat]]s often make nests by bringing straw, cloth scraps, and other soft materials to a selected nook or box; they particularly are attracted to [[hayloft]]s as nest sites. Commercial [[Whelping box|Whelping]] and queening boxes are available however, children's wading pools (dogs) and plastic dishpans (cats) work just as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In birds it is known as "going broody", and is characterized by the insistence to stay on the nest as much as possible, and by cessation of laying new eggs. [[Marsupial]]s do not exhibit a nesting instinct per se, because the mother's pouch fulfills the function of housing the newborns. Nest building is performed in order to provide sufficient shelter and comfort to the arriving offspring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Wischner, D. Kemper, N. Krieter, J.|year=2009|title=Nest-building behvaiour in sows and consequences for pig husbandry|url=http://www.prairieswine.com/pdf/39825.pdf|journal=Livestock Science|volume=124|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2009.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats, such as predators, that decrease the chance of survival will increase care of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-01|title=Paternal investment with an uncertain future: effects of predator exposure on filial cannibalism and nesting behaviour|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347217302476|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=132|pages=81–90|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.07.024|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sand goby (''[[Sand goby|Pomatoschistus minutus]])'' the males are the ones who build the nests. When males exhibit increased paternal care to eggs, they build nests with smaller entrances in comparison to males who provide less parental care. This helps prevent predators from entering the nest and consuming the offspring or developing eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-01|title=Paternal investment with an uncertain future: effects of predator exposure on filial cannibalism and nesting behaviour|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347217302476|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=132|pages=81–90|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.07.024|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Pig|Pigs]]====
Under natural conditions, sows will leave the herd and travel up to 6.5&amp;nbsp;km &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a day prior to [[parturition]] in order to find the appropriate spot for a nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Yun, K. Valros, A.|year=2015|title=Benefits of prepartum nest-building behaviour on parturition and lactating sows|journal=Asian-Australian Journal of Animal Science|volume=28|pages=1519–1524|via=|doi=10.5713/ajas.15.0174|pmid=26333669|pmc=4647089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sows will use their forelimbs and snouts in order to create excavated depressions within the ground and to gather/transport nesting materials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Mayer, J. Martin, D. Brisbin, I. Jr.|year=2002|title=Characteristics of wild pig farrowing nests and bed in the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina|url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(02)00114-4/fulltext|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour|volume=78|pages=1–17|via=|doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nests vary in radius dependent on the age of the sow, the nests are generally a round to oval shape and are usually located near trees, uprooted stumps or logs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The shelter provided by the nest built in sows is of utmost importance to [[thermoregulation]]. For the first two weeks of the piglets life their physiological thermoregulation is still developing, and due to a lack of amount of brown fat tissue, piglets require an increased surrounding temperature. Without the protection of the nest, the piglets will be subjected to climatic influences causing their internal temperature to drop to life-threatening levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Farrowing crate]]s have been widely implemented into modern pig husbandry in order to reduce piglet mortality via crushing. However, this type of housing disturbs the sows natural instinct to nest build due to lack of space. Thus, it is necessary for the sows to farrow without the performance of this natural pre-partum activity which results in high stress for the animal.

==== [[Rodent|Rodents]] ====
[[File:Wood rat (Neotoma lepida) midden.jpg|thumb|Wood rat (''Neotoma lepida'') nest at [[Joshua Tree National Park]]]]
In [[rodent]]s and [[lagomorph]]s, the nesting instinct is typically characterized by the urge to seek the lowest sheltered spot available; this is where these [[mammals]] give birth. Rats, for example, prefer to burrow amongst dense areas of vegetation or around human settlements which they come into contact with often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triunveri|first=Alfeo|date=24 May 2012|title=Rodents: Habitat, Pathology and Environmental Impact|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=3020359&amp;ppg=3|journal=Animal Science, Issues and Professions|volume=|pages=1-194|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often some rodent species create burrows that develop microclimates. This is another way that nesting instinct aids in [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=The evolution of nesting behaviour in Peromyscus mice|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347218300897|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=139|pages=103–115|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.03.008|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alzheimer's disease in rats has been observed to impair the nesting ability, especially in females. These impairments become exaggerated with age and progression of disease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Hormones and nesting behavior===
Maternal nest-building is regulated by the hormonal actions of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin. Given the importance of shelter to offspring survival and reproductive success, it is no wonder that a set of common hormonal signals has evolved. However, the exact timing and features of nest building vary among species, depending on endocrine and external factors.

The initial drive to perform this behaviour is stimulated internally via [[hormone]]s specifically a rise in prolactin levels. This increase is driven by an increase in prostaglandin and a decrease in progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Algers, B. Uvnas-Moberg, K.|year=2007|title=Maternal behaviour in pigs|url=http://fulltext.study/preview/pdf/322972.pdf|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=52|pages=78–85|via=|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of nest building is driven by external stimuli, this phase is also known as the material-oriented phase. In this stage it is said that external stimuli such as the proper nest building materials must be present. Both internal and external stimuli must exist in conjunction with one another for nest building to commence. The cessation of the nesting building is correlated with a rise in [[oxytocin]] which is the hormone responsible for the contraction of the [[uterus]]. Shortly after this, parturition will commence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[rabbit]]s, nest building occurs towards the last third of pregnancy. The mother digs and builds a nest of straw and grass, which she lines with hair plucked from her body. This sequential motor pattern is produced by changes in estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin levels. Six to eight days pre-partum, high levels of [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] lead to a peak in digging behavior. Both estradiol and progesterone are produced and released by the ovaries. One to three days pre-partum, straw-carrying behavior is expressed as a function of decreasing progesterone levels, maintenance of high estradiol levels, and increasing prolactin levels. This release of prolactin (from the [[anterior pituitary]]) is likely caused by the increase in estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. One day pre-partum to four days post-partum, hair loosening and plucking occur as a result of low progesterone and high prolactin levels, together with a decrease in testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.1996.tb00818.x |title=Estradiol, Progesterone, and Prolactin Regulate Maternal Nest-Building in Rabbits |year=1996 |last1=González-Mariscal |first1=G. |last2=Melo |first2=A. I. |last3=Jiménez |first3=P. |last4=Beyer |first4=C. |last5=Rosenblatt |first5=J. S. |journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=901–7 |pmid=8953467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In house mice and golden hamsters, nest-building takes place earlier, at the start or middle of pregnancy. For these species, nest-building coincides with high levels of estrogen and progestin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(71)80118-5 |title=Oestrogen and progesterone synergism and elicitation of maternal nest-building in the mouse (Mus musculus) |year=1971 |last1=Lisk |first1=Robert D. |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=606–10 |pmid=5156617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(69)90022-0 |title=Effects of oestrogen and progesterone on nest building in the golden hamster |year=1969 |last1=Richards |first1=M.P.M. |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=17 |pages=356–61 |pmid=5388889 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External factors also interact with hormones to influence maternal nest-building behavior. Pregnant rabbits that have been shaved will line their straw nest with available alternatives, such as male rabbit hair or synthetic hair. If given both straw and hair, mothers prefer straw during the straw-carrying period, and prefer hair during the nest-lining period. If given hair as the only material, shaved mothers collect the hair even when it is the straw-carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/hbeh.1997.1425 |title=Hormones and External Factors: Are They "On/Off" Signals for Maternal Nest-Building in Rabbits? |year=1998 |last1=González-Mariscal |first1=G. |last2=Cuamatzi |first2=E. |last3=Rosenblatt |first3=J.S. |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=33 |pages=1–8 |pmid=9571007 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on avian paternal behavior shows that nest-building is triggered by different stimuli in the two sexes. Unlike the case for females, male nest-building among ring doves depends on the behavior of the prospective mate rather than on hormonal mechanisms. Males that are castrated and injected daily with testosterone either court females or build nests, depending purely on the behavior of the female. Hence, the male avian transition from courtship to nest-building is prompted by social cues and not by changes in hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=27848517 |last=Silver |first1=Rae |year=1978 |title=The Parental Behavior of Ring Doves: The intricately coordinated behavior of the male and female is based on distinct physiological mechanisms in the sexes |journal=American Scientist |publisher=Sigma Xi |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=209–15 |bibcode=1978AmSci..66..209S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In insects==
[[File:Tawny Mining Bee nest - Andrena Fulva 2d.jpg|thumb|Tawny Mining Bee (''Andrena fulva'') nest entrance]]
Nesting behavior is also present in many invertebrates. The best known example of nesting behavior in insects is that of the domestic [[honey bee]]. Most [[bee]]s build nests. Solitary bees, like honey bees, make nests. However, solitary bees make individual nests for larvae and are not always in colonies.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxleas.com/make-a-bee-hotel.asp|title=Make a Bee Hotel - The Pollinator Garden|website=www.foxleas.com|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary bees will burrow into the ground, dead wood and plants.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://xerces.org/enhancing-habitat-for-native-bees/|title=Enhancing Habitat for Bees - The Xerces Society|work=The Xerces Society|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==

In '''packed pixel''' or '''chunky''' [[framebuffer]] organization, the bits defining each [[pixel]] are grouped together. For example, if there are 16 bits per pixel, each pixel is represented in two consecutive (contiguous) 8-bit bytes in the framebuffer (a.k.a. [[screen buffer]]).  If there are 4 bits per pixel (16 colors), each frame buffer byte defines two pixels, one in each [[nibble]].  The latter example is as opposed to storing perhaps half of the bits—2 bits—for each of four pixels in one byte and the other two bits for each of those four pixels in another byte or bytes.  It is also as opposed to interleaving the bits of the two pixels within the byte.  As this illustrates, packed pixel organization can be directly contrasted with [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] organization.

==Electron excitation==
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|210px|right| After absorbing energy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited state.]]

[[Electron excitation]] is the movement of an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy state]]. This can either be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the original electron absorbs the photon and gains all the photon's energy or by electrical [[Excited state|excitation]] (EE), where the original electron absorbs the energy of another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to move electrons to a higher [[energy band]]. When an excited electron falls back to a lower energy state again, it is called electron relaxation. This can be done by radiation of a photon or giving the energy to a third spectator particle as well.&lt;ref name=2-electron&gt;

In physics there is a specific technical definition for [[energy level]] which is often associated with an atom being excited to an [[excited state]]. The excited state, in general, is in relation to the [[ground state]], where the excited state is at a higher [[energy level]] than the ground state.

==Photoexcitation==
{{See also|Photoelectric effect}}

[[Photoexcitation]] is the mechanism of [[electron excitation]] by [[photon]] absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory.

Photoexcitation plays role in photoisomerization. Photoexcitation is exploited in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s, [[photochemistry]], [[luminescence]], optically [[laser pumping|pumped]] lasers, and in some [[photochromic]] applications.

==Photoisomerization==
[[File:Azobenzene isomerization.svg|thumb|Photoisomerization of azobenzene]]
In [[chemistry]], '''photoisomerization''' is [[molecule|molecular]] behavior in which structural change between [[isomer]]s is caused by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerization reactions exist. However, the word "photoisomerization" usually indicates a reversible process. Photoisomerizable molecules are already put to practical use, for instance, in [[pigment]]s for [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]], [[DVD-RW|DVDs]], and [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. In addition, recent interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular electronics.

Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are ''trans-cis'' (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include [[stilbene]] and [[azobenzene]]. This type of compounds has a double [[chemical bond|bond]], and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include [[fulgide]] and [[diarylethene]]. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the [[Di-pi-methane rearrangement]].

==Photoionization==
{{See also|Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}}

[[Photoionization]] is the physical process in which an incident [[photon]] ejects one or more [[electron]]s from an [[atom]], [[ion]] or [[molecule]]. This is essentially the same process that occurs with the photoelectric effect with metals. In the case of a gas or single atoms, the term photoionization is more common.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"&gt;
{{Cite web

 | accessdate =2009-11-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ejected electrons, known as [[photoelectron]]s, carry information about their pre-ionized states. For example, a single electron can have a [[kinetic energy]] equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the [[electron binding energy]] of the state it left. Photons with energies less than the electron binding energy may be absorbed or [[scattering|scattered]] but will not photoionize the atom or ion.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

For example, to ionize [[hydrogen]], photons need an energy greater than 13.6 [[electronvolt]]s, which corresponds to a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometer|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For photons with greater energy than this, the energy of the emitted photoelectron is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; { mv^2 \over 2 } = h \nu - 13.6 eV&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the photon.

This formula defines the [[photoelectric effect]].

Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the [[Photoionisation cross section|photoionization cross-section]], which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of infrared or visible light), [[non-perturbative]] phenomena such as ''barrier suppression ionization''&lt;ref&gt;

===Multi-photon ionization===
{{See also|Fluorescence spectroscopy| Fluorescence| Photoionization mode}}

Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing ''N'' photons depends on the laser-light intensity ''I'' as ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

The excess energy gives the released electron higher [[kinetic energy]] than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its [[photoelectron spectrum]] which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.

{{Main|Photo-Dember}}

In semiconductor physics the [[Photo-Dember]] effect (named after its discoverer H. Dember) consists in the formation of a charge [[dipole]] in the vicinity of a [[semiconductor]] surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface.&lt;ref name=photodember&gt;

==Grotthuss–Draper law==
The '''Grotthuss–Draper law''' (also called the '''Principle of Photochemical Activation''') states that only that light which is absorbed by a system can bring about a photochemical change. Materials such as [[dye]]s and [[phosphor]]s must be able to absorb "light" at optical frequencies. This law provides a basis for [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]]. The law was first proposed in 1817 by [[Theodor Grotthuss]] and in 1842, independently, by [[John William Draper]].&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

This is considered to be one of the two basic laws of [[photochemistry]]. The second law is the [[Photoelectrochemical processes#Stark–Einstein law|Stark–Einstein law]], which says that primary chemical or physical reactions occur with each [[photon]] absorbed.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

==Stark–Einstein law==
The '''Stark–Einstein law''' is named after German-born physicists [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who independently formulated the law between 1908 and 1913. It is also known as the '''photochemical equivalence law''' or '''photoequivalence law'''. In essence it says that every photon that is absorbed will cause a (primary) chemical or physical reaction.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw&gt;
{{Cite web
 |title=Photochemical equivalence law
 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/457732/photochemical-equivalence-law
 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]
 |accessdate=2009-11-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photon is a quantum of radiation, or one unit of radiation. Therefore, this is a single unit of EM radiation that is equal to Planck's constant (h) times the frequency of light. This quantity is symbolized by γ, hν, or ħω.

The photochemical equivalence law is also restated as follows: for every [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance that reacts, an equivalent mole of quanta of light are absorbed. The formula is:&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{mol} = N_A h \nu &lt;/math&gt;

where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]].

The photochemical equivalence law applies to the part of a light-induced reaction that is referred to as the primary process (i.e. [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[fluorescence]]).&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

In most photochemical reactions the primary process is usually followed by so-called secondary photochemical processes that are normal interactions between reactants not requiring absorption of light. As a result, such reactions do not appear to obey the one quantum–one molecule reactant relationship.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

The law is further restricted to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light sources such as those used in [[flash photolysis]] and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

==Absorption==
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}

In [[physics]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of electromagnetic radiation is the way by which the [[energy]] of a [[photon]] is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. Thus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy, for example, to heat. The absorption of light during [[wave propagation]] is often called [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in [[optics]]), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and the [[Saturable absorption]] (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

==Photosensitization==
[[Photosensitization]] is a process of transferring the [[energy]] of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) [[reactant]]s. This is part of the work of [[photochemistry]] in general. In particular this process is commonly employed where reactions require light sources of certain [[wavelength]]s that are not readily available.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] absorbs radiation at 1849 and 2537 [[angstrom]]s, and the source is often high-intensity [[arc lamp|mercury lamps]]. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with [[ethylene]], and the compound is [[irradiated]] with a mercury lamp, this results in the photodecomposition of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

[[Cadmium]]; some of the [[noble gas]]es, for example [[xenon]]; [[zinc]]; [[benzophenone]]; and a large number of organic dyes, are also used as sensitizers.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization&gt;
{{Cite web
 |title =Photosensitization
 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/458153/photosensitization

 |accessdate =2009-11-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photosensitiser]]s are a key component of [[photodynamic therapy]] used to treat cancers.

==Sensitizer==
{{For|the particulate material used to create voids that aid in the initiation or propagation of an explosive's detonation wave|Explosive sensitiser}}

A '''sensitizer''' in [[chemiluminescence]] is a chemical compound, capable of [[light emission]] after it has received energy from a molecule, which became excited previously in the chemical reaction. A good example is this:

When an alkaline solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] and a concentrated solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are mixed, a reaction occurs:

:ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*(g) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*is excited oxygen&amp;nbsp;– meaning, one or more electrons in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule have been promoted to higher-energy [[molecular orbital]]s. Hence, oxygen produced by this chemical reaction somehow 'absorbed' the energy released by the reaction and became excited. This energy state is unstable, therefore it will return to the [[ground state]] by lowering its energy. It can do that in more than one way:

*it can react further, without any light emission
*it can lose energy without emission, for example, giving off heat to the surroundings or transferring energy to another molecule
*it can emit light

The intensity, duration and color of emitted light depend on [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetical]] factors. However, excited molecules are frequently less capable of light emission in terms of brightness and duration when compared to sensitizers. This is because sensitizers can store energy (that is, be excited) for longer periods of time than other excited molecules. The energy is stored through means of [[quantum vibration]], so sensitizers are usually compounds which either include systems of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] rings or many conjugated double and triple [[covalent bond|bonds]] in their structure. Hence, if an excited molecule transfers its energy to a sensitizer thus exciting it, longer and easier to quantify light emission is often observed.

The color (that is, the [[wavelength]]), brightness and duration of emission depend upon the sensitizer used. Usually, for a certain chemical reaction, many different sensitizers can be used.

==Fluorescence spectroscopy==
[[Fluorescence spectroscopy]] aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sym-spectroscopy/&gt;

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Absorption spectroscopy==
[[Absorption spectroscopy]] refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy&gt;

'''Procuring''' or '''pandering''' is the facilitation or provision of a [[prostitute]] or [[sex worker]] in the arrangement of a [[sex act]] with a customer.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, B. &amp; Black, H. (2004). [[Black's Law Dictionary]]. Belmont: Thomson/West.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''procurer''', colloquially called a '''pimp''' (if male) or a '''madam''' (if female), is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] for [[prostitution|prostitutes]] who collects part of their [[income|earnings]]. The procurer may receive this money in return for advertising services, physical protection, or for providing, and possibly monopolizing, a location where the prostitute may engage clients. Like prostitution, the legality of certain actions of a madam or a pimp vary from one region to the next.

Examples of procuring include:
*[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] a person into a country for the purpose of soliciting sex
*operating a prostitution business
*transporting a prostitute to the location of their arrangement
*deriving financial gain from the prostitution of another

== Overview ==
Procuring can often take abusive forms. Pimps may punish clients for physical abuse or failure to pay, and enforce exclusive rights to 'turf' where their prostitutes may advertise and operate with less competition.&lt;ref name="Figueroa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/13/local/me-figueroa13|title=L.A. seeks to thwart sex trade on Figueroa|last=Zahniser|first=David|date=13 May 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the many places where prostitution is outlawed, sex workers have decreased incentive to report abuse for fear of [[self-incrimination]], and increased motivation to seek any physical protection from clients and law enforcement that a pimp might provide.

The pimp–prostitute relationship is widely understood to be abusive and possessive, with the pimp/madam using techniques such as psychological intimidation, manipulation, starvation, rape and/or gang rape, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victim's family, forced drug use and the shame from these acts.&lt;ref name="55facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facts.randomhistory.com/human-trafficking-facts.html|title=55 Little Known Facts About...

== Legal status and debates about legality ==
In most places where prostitution is illegal, so is procuring, no matter if the relationship between the procurer and prostitute is {{clarify |text=formal or informal.|date=September 2017}} Where [[Decriminalizing sex work|prostitution is decriminalized]] or [[regulated]], procuring may or may not be legal. In [[jurisdictions]] where procuring is allowed, however, the only{{dubious |date=September 2017}} forms permitted do not involve threats or other forms of [[non-consensual acts]] towards the prostitute or other persons; all procuring regulations differ widely from place to place.

[[Legality of prostitution|Procuring and brothels are legal]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[New Zealand]], most of [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]] and [[Prostitution in Nevada|Nevada]], among other places.{{citation needed |date=September 2017}}

===Canada===
{{Main|Bedford v. Canada}}
In [[Canada]], there was a legal challenge to prostitution laws, which ended in the 2013 ruling of ''[[Bedford v. Canada]]''. In 2010,  [[Ontario]] Superior Court Judge Susan Himel overturned the national laws banning brothels and procuring, arguing that they violated the constitution guaranteeing "the right to life, liberty and security".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11432138 Canadian judge overturns brothel ban in Ontario], [[BBC]]. 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ontario [[Appeal Court]] reaffirmed the unconstitutionality of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/03/26/ontario-appeal-court-sex-trade-laws-monday.html Ontario Appeal Court strikes down ban on brothels], [[CBC News]]. 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed by the [[Canadian government]], and was under trial in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-top-court-to-hear-prostitution-challenge-today-1.1323766 |title=Canada's top court to hear prostitution challenge today &amp;#124; |website=[[CTV News]] |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the remaining prostitution laws. {{As of |2014}}, the Canadian government began working on replacing those regulations with ones that don't violate the Canadian constitution.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] 1949 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] requires state signatories to ban pimping and brothels, and to abolish regulation of individual prostitutes. It states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/trafficpersons.pdf |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others
 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 1

The Parties to the present Convention agree to punish any person who, to gratify the passions of another:

(1) Procures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person;

(2) Exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person.

Article 2

The Parties to the present Convention further agree to punish any person who:

(1) Keeps or manages, or knowingly finances or takes part in the financing of a brothel;

(2) Knowingly lets or rents a building or other place or any part thereof for the purpose of the prostitution of others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various UN commissions however have differing positions on the issue. For example, in 2012, a [[UNAIDS]] commission convened by Ban Ki-moon and backed by [[UNDP]] and UNAIDS, recommended the [[Decriminalizing sex work|decriminalization of brothels and procuring]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/4128420.html Decriminalisation integral to the fight against HIV], Michael Kirby &amp; Michael Wong, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnsnews.com/news/article/un-commission-calls-legalizing-prostitution-worldwide U.N.

== Etymology ==
{{wikt|procurer}}
=== ''Procurer'' ===

The term ''procurer'' derives from the French ''procureur''.

=== ''Pimping'' ===
The word ''pimp'' first appeared in English in 1607 in a [[Thomas Middleton]] play entitled ''[[Your Five Gallants]].'' Of unknown origin, but may have stemmed from the French infinitive ''pimper'' meaning to dress up elegantly and from the present participle ''pimpant'' meaning alluring in seductive dress. ''Pimp'' used as a verb, meaning to act as a pimp, first appeared in 1636 in [[Philip Massinger]]'s play, ''[[The Bashful Lover]]''.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term was commonly used to refer to [[informant|informers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsoniansource.org/display/primarysource/viewdetails.aspx?PrimarySourceId=1004 |title=Pennsylvania Gazette, Nov 7, 1765, transcription |publisher=Smithsonian Source |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pimp can also mean "a despicable person".&lt;ref&gt;"Webster's College Dictionary", Random House, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be applied to a person who is considered a [[:wikt:ladies' man|ladies' man]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;
[[Jesse Sheidlower]]: [http://www.slate.com/id/2184211/ A History of Pimping. What the word meant and what it means now.] [[Slate.com]], 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb "pimping" came up in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Rapper [[Nelly]] tried to redefine the word "pimp" by saying that it is an [[acronym]] for "positive, intellectual, motivated person." He created a [[college scholarship]] with the name "P.I.M.P. Juice Scholarship". Dawn Turner Trice of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' argues that there is "something truly unsettling, to say the least, about attaching such a vile word to a scholarship" and expresses concern about the glamorization of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Trice, Dawn Turner. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-04-27/news/0504270140_1_rap-word-frat "Scholarship is soured by unsavory name"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 27 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of the 21st century, a new meaning of the word has emerged in the form of a transitive verb ''pimp'', which means "to decorate" or "to [[wiktionary : gussy up|gussy up]]" (compare ''[[primping|primp]]'', especially in Scottish usage). This new definition was made popular by ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', an [[MTV]] television show.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Although this new definition paid homage to [[hip-hop]] culture and its connection to street culture, it has now entered common, even mainstream commercial, use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2007/09/20/NEWS-PimpMyFeetVerb-F.rtf.aspx | title= Feet pimping | date=20 September 2007 | accessdate=26 September 2007 |publisher=[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical contexts, the verb means "to ask (a student) a question for the purpose of testing her or his knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brancati|first=Frederick L.|title=The Art of Pimping|journal=JAMA|date=7 July 1989|volume=262|issue=1|page=89|url=http://www.neonatology.org/pearls/pimping.html|doi=10.1001/jama.1989.03430010101039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Pandering'' ===
The word "pander", meaning to "pimp" is derived from [[Pandarus]], a licentious figure who facilitates the affair between the protagonists in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laughter in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Times: Epistemology of a Fundamental Human Behavior, Its Meaning, and Consequences  |last=Classen |first=Albrecht |year=2010 |isbn=978-3110245479 |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandarus appears with a similar role in [[Shakespeare]]'s interpretation of the story, ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

{{criminal law}}
Pimping is sometimes operated like a business.&lt;ref name="reallyreallypimping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/really_really_pimpin_in_da_south/|title=Really Really Pimpin' in Da South|author=|date=|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pimp may have a [[bottom girl]] who serves as office manager, keeping the pimp apprised of law-enforcement activity and collecting money from the prostitutes.&lt;ref name="pipkins"&gt;[http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200214306.pdf U.S. v. Pipkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911145823/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200214306.pdf |date=2012-09-11 }}, 378 F.3d 1281, (11th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Pimps recognize a [[hierarchy]] among themselves. The least respected, or newer pimps, are the "popcorn pimps" and "wannabes". "Popcorn pimps" was a phenomenon which occurred among adolescent cocaine users of both sexes who utilized children younger than themselves to support their habits.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro, Ann Marie and Pagliaro, Louis A. (1996). Substance abuse among children and adolescents : its nature, extent, and effects from conception to adulthood. New York: Wiley, p. 19. {{ISBN|9780471580423}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A pimp who uses violence and intimidation to control his prostitutes is called a "guerrilla pimp", while those who use psychological trickery to deceive younger prostitutes into becoming hooked into the system are called "finesse pimps".&lt;ref&gt;378 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004). http://openjurist.org/378/f3d/1281/united-states-v-pipkins&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the business is obtaining and maintaining a selection of prostitutes. Losing one's prostitute to another pimp is known as being "peeled". Informing a pimp that one of his prostitutes has switched pimps is a professional courtesy, and any attempt to respond to this courtesy with violence will quickly get the violent pimp labeled a "Gorilla" or "Godzilla". Prostitutes who move between pimps often are labeled as a "Choosey Susie". In addition, a prostitute may "bounce" from pimp to pimp without paying the "pimp moving" tax.&lt;ref&gt;
Western Michigan University, [http://www.wmich.edu/destinys-end/pimping%20game.htm ''The Pimping Game'']. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113021452/http://www.wmich.edu/destinys-end/pimping%20game.htm |date=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large percentage of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as a major source of funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While selling drugs may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentencing]] laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence of gangs (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used to go after the more serious and violent offenders.&lt;ref name="Prostitution &amp; Gangs"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Deane|first=Matthew|title=Prostitution &amp; Gangs. Techniques for going after violent offenders|url=http://www.lawofficer.com/article/prostitution-gangs|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pimp business has an internal structure – built around violence – for dealing with rule breakers. For example, pimps have been known to employ a "[[pimp stick]]", which is two coat hangers wrapped together, in order to subdue unruly prostitutes.&lt;ref name="pipkins"/&gt; A variation is a "pimp cane", used for similar purposes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Another punishment for disobedient prostitutes is to "trunk" them, where the pimp locks the prostitute in the trunk of a car. Although prostitutes are supposedly free to move between pimps, this movement sometimes leads to violence. For example, a prostitute could be punished for merely looking at another pimp; this is considered "reckless eyeballing".&lt;ref name="pipkins"/&gt; Violence is also used on customers, for example if the customer attempts to evade payment or becomes unruly with a prostitute.

=== Use of tattoos ===
Many pimps tattoo prostitutes as a mark of "ownership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27runaways.html?pagewanted=all|title=RUNNING IN THE SHADOWS; For Runaways on the Street, Sex Buys Survival|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=27 October 2009|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Julie, [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=humtrafconf2 "The Intersection of Law, Theology, and Human Trafficking in the Narrative of Joseph: Linking the Past to the Present"] (2010). Second Annual Interdisciplinary Conference on Human Trafficking, 2010. Paper 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tattoo will often be the pimp's street name or even his likeness. The mark might be as discreet as ankle tattoo, or blatant as a neck tattoo, or large scale font across the prostitute's lower back, thigh, chest, or buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowe|first=Claudia|title=No way out: Teen girls sell bodies in Seattle|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/No-way-out-Teen-girls-sell-bodies-in-Seattle-1277746.php|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet effect ===
Since the Internet became widely available, it has become the preferred medium for prostitution. Prostitutes increasingly use websites to solicit sexual encounters. In turn, pimps have used these sites to broker their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=Pimps Go Online to Lure Kids Into Prostitution|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/02/pimping/|newspaper=Wired|date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of portrayals ===
Some [[sex workers rights]] advocates and activists dispute the portrayal of third-party agents as "violent pimps" to be an inaccurate exaggeration used to foster harmful policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNeill|first=Maggie|title=The Honest Courtesan: Bogeymen|url=https://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/bogeymen/|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pornography and procuring ==
Attempts have been made in the U.S. to charge pornographic-film producers with pandering under state law. The case of ''California v. Freeman'' in 1989 is one of the most prominent examples where a producer/director of pornographic films was charged with pandering under the argument that paying porn actors to perform sex on camera was a form of prostitution covered by a state anti-pandering statute. The State Supreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the California pandering statute was not intended to cover the hiring of actors who would be engaging in sexually-explicit but non-obscene performances. It also stated that only in cases where the producer paid the actors for the purpose of sexually gratifying themselves or other actors, could the producer be charged with pandering under state law. This case effectively legalized pornography in the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=488&amp;invol=1311 |title=California v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">The word '''psychosophy''' has etymological roots in the Greek words ψυχή (''psychē'') and σοφίᾱ (''sophiā''), which are often interpreted as "soul" and "wisdom", respectively. It was used in a wide variety of contexts from 1743 to the 1920s but fell out of use in the 20th century.

There are several distinct contexts in which the word has been employed, including:
# Early historical uses
# [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[neo-theosophical]] and [[Anthroposophical]]
# The contemporary school of psychology founded by the American teacher, Scott Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosophy.com See Psychosophy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historical usages and references==
* [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–1769) was an Italian writer on [[philosophy]] and political economy. His first works were ''Elementa Melaphysicae'' (1743) and ''Lógica'' (1745). The former is divided into four parts: Ontosophy, Cosmosophy, Theosophy, and Psychosophy, and is supplemented by a treatise on ethics and a dissertation on first causes.
* In 1913, the term was employed by the American philosopher and developmental psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] in his book ''History of Psychology: A Sketch and Interpretation'' (Volume I, Chapter II). Baldwin referenced the use of the word psychosophy in the 17th to 18th century as a "catch-all" term for early pre-scientific approaches to exploring the psyche (i.e., magic and mythic approaches preceding the rise of Western [[psychology]] as a formal scientific discipline). The term was similarly referenced in multiple subsequent psychological texts (e.g., Jared Sparks Moore's "Foundations of Psychology") in the '10s and early '20s, presumably employing the word in a manner similar to that of Baldwin.
* ''A History of Psychology'', by Otto Klemm, Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, translated by Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, published by C. Scribner's Sons, 1914, original from the University of Michigan, digitized Oct 3, 2006, 380 pages, Psychosophy reference on p.&amp;nbsp;147:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The word psychology does not occur previous to the sixteenth century. Melanchthon employed the term as a title of academic lectures. R. Gockel used it in 1590 as a collective title for the works of various authors. The term became generally known through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754), who did so much for the establishment of philosophical terminology. Up to Wolff's time the term "psychosophy", apparently introduced by J. J. Becker, seems to have been in use. The term pneumatology is also found in the writings of Leibniz.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the philosopher [[:es:Julio Ozan Lavoisier|Julio Ozan Lavoisier]], ''Psychosophy'': "it is a knowledge of the first causes, which aims at the plenitude of human beings and their integration in the World through the unification of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;-''The Return to the Sources, Chapter Philosophy, Religion and Psychosophy''- Ed. Rueda, Madrid España, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  A basic principle of this discipline is that "psychic balance and moral balance are consecutive." Nevertheless, it does not deal with personal or subjective problems, as it may only bloom in mature spirits. Therefore, "psychosophy starts where psychology ends." "Psychosophy starts from an essential perspective (for which the author has developed a theory of perspective within his theory of knowledge), not from what has been revealed but from what is revealing" (Op. Cit.).

Eleven years later, Ozan Lavoisier published ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on the nature of human beings'',&lt;ref&gt;Julio Ozan Lavoisier, ''Psychosophy'', Ed. Dunquen, Buenos Aires, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; a thick volume in which he elaborates upon his method of knowledge in detail. He make clear that his discipline is not in search of news, but "perennial truths found in ancient traditions."  It is essentially ''"a philosophy that makes use of transcendental psychology in order to provide grounds for a metaphysics, ethics, esthetics, a theory of knowledge and a philosophy of history, that is to say, a philosophical system."'' This system has been developed in the following treatises:
* ''Return to the Sources'' (Ed. Rueda, Madrid 1993)
* ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on Human nature'' (Dunken, Bs.As. 2004)
* ''Origin and Destiny of Man'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2008)
* ''The Evolution of Spirit'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2009)
* ''The Evolution of the Spirit. From Greece to  the West, from India to the East.'' (Har-Anand Publishers, Delhi, 2017)
* ''The Spirit in History'' (Dunken, Bs. As.)
* ''The Spirit in the Moral''. The author's next book.
* ''The Spirit in the Arts.'' The author's next book.
Therefore, the concept of Psychosophy, according to Ozán Lavoisier, should be interpreted in the context of this system, independently of other views or schools that have adopted this concept.

==Theosophical and neo-theosophical==
The word psychosophy was utilized in several articles published in the Theosophical journal ''The Theosophist'':
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (1), William Oxley, an index to ''The Theosophist'', September, 1882, v3, p298
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (2), [[Tallapragada Subba Row|T Subba Row]], an index to ''The Theosophist'', October, 1882 v4, p18

The term was also used by William Wilberforce Juvenal Colville in an obscure 1914 publication entitled "The New Psychosophy." The following year, in 1915, [[Cora L. V. Scott|Cora L.V. (Scott) Richmond]] employed the word as the title of her 436-page book exploring various metaphysical subjects. These two writings are examples of the approach that could broadly be considered neo-theosophical.

The term was used by the Austrian philosopher and scholar Rudolf Steiner in a three part series of twelve lectures given in Berlin in 1910, two years before he left the Theosophical Society, but was not apparently used again in Steiner's extensive published works. The lectures lay almost dormant for nearly 90 years until their publication. The four lectures on psychosophy discuss Steiner's perspective on the primary aspects of the human soul, the activities and interactions of various soul forces, the dynamics of love and hate, and the process of judging. Steiner distinguished psychosophy from [[anthroposophy]] (wisdom of the human being) and [[pneumatosophy]] (wisdom of the spirit).&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner states; "''Psychosophy'' is to be a deliberation on the human soul, beginning with the soul's experiences here in the physical world. It then rises to higher realms to demonstrate that whatever we encounter in the physical as the manifest soul-life leads to the perspective where the light of Theosophy comes to meet us."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999, p77&lt;/ref&gt; He continues; "every aspect of the soul is either a making of judgments or a life in love or hate. Basically, these are the only concepts that pertain to the soul; all others refer to a vehicle for something coming into the soul, either from without through the body, or (due to causes we will learn later) from the spirit within. Thus, on the one hand, we have judgment, and, on the other, love and hate ... My characterization is not about logic, but about the psychosophic nature &amp;ndash; strictly from the perspective of inner activity, or soul processes &amp;ndash; of judging. Everything you can learn about judgment through logic is ruled out. I am not speaking of 'judgment' but of ''judging'', the ''activity'' of judging, using the word as a verb."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999 pp 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scott Hamilton==
The American teacher Scott Hamilton has trademarked the United States for his contemporary school of psychology offering coaching, consulting and education and synthesizes psychology, philosophy, spirituality, growth technology, and creative actualization. The synthesis unites common elements of past schools of psychology with new research methodology and models of human nature, development, relationships, creativity, coaching, consulting and education. Placing these in causal sequence, psychosophy can be viewed as:

# A new interior research method generating
# An experimentally verified model of inner human nature, which leads to
# A new understanding of human development,
# A new understanding of human relationships, and
# A new understanding of human creativity, all of which are integrated into
# New coaching, consulting and educational systems

Hamilton began developing and sharing the central principles and techniques underlying psychosophy in 1987, following a vision experience of the project. In 1994 he combined the first part of psychology with the second part of philosophy to create the term psychosophy. It was only years later that he discovered that the term had been used in a variety of other contexts in the early 20th and prior centuries. In 1999 Hamilton began formally offering Psychosophy Coaching and Consulting Services. He trained the first group of Psychosophy coaches and consultants from 2005–10, all of whom have launched private practices. In 2008 peer-reviewed research into one of psychosophy's foundational practices—Holding Loving Space—was conducted by Nicholas Hedlund and published in [[Ken Wilber]]'s and [[Sean Esbjörn-Hargens]]' ''Journal of Integral Theory and Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integralresearchcenter.org/source under Vol. 3 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 psychosophy's model of human consciousness, the Consciousness Coordinate System, was presented at the Integral Theory Conference at [[John F. Kennedy University]] in Northern California.

In [[data structures]], the '''range searching''' problem most generally consists of [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]] a set ''S'' of objects, in order to determine which objects from ''S'' intersect with a query object, called a ''range''. For example, if ''S'' is a set of points corresponding to the coordinates of several cities, a geometric variant of the problem is to find cities within a certain [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] range.

The range searching problem and the [[data structure|data structures]] that solve it are a fundamental topic of [[computational geometry]]. Applications of the problem arise in areas including [[Geographic information system|geographical information systems]] (GIS) and [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided design]] (CAD), and [[database|databases]].

== Variations ==

There are several variations of the problem, and different data structures may be necessary for different variations.&lt;ref name="Agarwal99"&gt;{{citation|first1=P. K.|last1=Agarwal|author1-link=Pankaj K. Agarwal|first2=J.|last2=Erickson|year=1999|contribution=Geometric Range Searching and Its Relatives|title=Advances in Discrete and Computational Geometry: proceedings of the 1996 AMS-IMS-SIAM joint summer research conference, Discrete and Computational Geometry--Ten Years Later, July 14-18, 1996, Mount Holyoke College|series=Contemporary Mathematics|volume=223|publisher=American Mathematical Society Press|pages=1–56|editor1-first=Bernard|editor1-last=Chazelle|editor1-link=Bernard Chazelle|editor2-first=Jacob|editor2-last=Goodman|editor2-link=Jacob E. Goodman|editor3-first=Richard|editor3-last=Pollack|contribution-url=http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/pubs/pdf/survey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain an efficient solution, several aspects of the problem need to be specified:

* Object types: Algorithms depend on whether ''S'' consists of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[line segment]]s, [[rectangle|box]]es, [[polygon]]s.... The simplest and most studied objects to search are points.
* Range types: The query ranges also need to be drawn from a predetermined set. Some well-studied sets of ranges, and the names of the respective problems are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (orthogonal range searching), [[simplex|simplices]], [[Half-space (geometry)|halfspace]]s, and [[sphere]]s/[[circle]]s.
* Query types: If the list of all objects that intersect the query range must be reported, the problem is called [[range reporting]], and the query is called a ''reporting query''. Sometimes, only the number of objects that intersect the range is required. In this case, the problem is called ''range counting'', and the query is called a ''counting query''. The ''emptiness query'' reports whether there is at least one object that intersects the range. In the ''semigroup version'', a [[commutative]] [[semigroup]] ('''S''',+) is specified, each point is assigned a weight from '''S''', and it is required to report the semigroup sum of the weights of the points that intersect the range.
* [[Dynamization|Dynamic]] range searching vs. static range searching: In the static setting the set ''S'' is known in advance. In dynamic setting objects may be inserted or deleted between queries.
* Offline range searching: Both the set of objects and the whole set of queries are known in advance.

== Data structures ==

=== Orthogonal range searching ===
[[File:Orthogonal range query.svg|thumb|A 2D orthogonal range query. In this case, a range reporting query would return the two circled points, a range counting query would return 2, and an emptiness query would return false.]]
In orthogonal range searching, the set ''S'' consists of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, and the query consists of intervals in each of those dimensions. Thus, the query consists of a multi-dimensional [[axis-aligned rectangle]]. With an output size of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Jon Bentley]] used a [[k-d tree]] to achieve (in [[Big O notation]]) &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O\big(n^{1 - \frac{1}{d}} + k\big)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Bentley75"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bentley|first1= Jon|author1-link = Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|date= 1975|title= Multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching |journal= [[Communications of the ACM]]|volume= 18|issue= 9|pages= 509–517 |doi=10.1145/361002.361007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley also proposed using [[Range tree#Range queries|range trees]], which improved query time to &lt;math&gt;O(\log^d n + k)&lt;/math&gt; but increased space to &lt;math&gt;O(n\log^{d - 1} n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bentley80"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bentley|first1= Jon|author1-link = Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|date= 1980|title= Multidimensional divide-and-conquer |journal= [[Communications of the ACM]]|volume= 23|issue= 4|pages= 214–229 |doi=10.1145/358841.358850}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Willard]] used downpointers, a special case of [[fractional cascading]] to reduce the query time further to &lt;math&gt;O(\log^{d - 1} n + k)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref
name="Willard85"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Willard|first1= Dan|author1-link = Dan Willard|date= 1985|title= New data structures for orthogonal range queries |journal= [[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume= 14|issue= 1|pages= 232–253 |doi=10.1137/0214019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above results were achieved in the [[pointer machine]] model, further improvements have been made in the [[word RAM]] [[model of computation]]. [[Bernard Chazelle]] used compress range trees to achieve &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; query time and &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space for range counting.&lt;ref name="Chazelle88"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chazelle|first1= Bernard|author1-link = Bernard Chazelle|date= 1988|title= A functional approach to data structures and its use in multidimensional searching |journal= [[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume= 17|issue= 3|pages= 427–462 |doi=10.1137/0217026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph JaJa and others later improved this query time to &lt;math&gt;O\left(\dfrac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for range counting, which matches a lower bound and is thus [[asymptotically optimal]].&lt;ref name="JaJa05"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= JaJa|first1= Joseph|last2= Mortensen|first2= Christian|last3 = Shi|first3 = Qingmin|date= 2005|title= Space-efficient and fast algorithms for multidimensional dominance reporting and counting |journal= [[International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation]]|pages= 558–568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the best results for range reporting found by [[Timothy M. Chan]], Kasper Larsen, and [[Mihai Pătrașcu]], also using compressed range trees in the word RAM model of computation, are one of the following:&lt;ref name="Chan11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chan|first1= Timothy|author1-link=Timothy M. Chan|last2= Larsen|first2= Kasper|last3 = Pătrașcu|first3 = Mihai|author3-link = Mihai Pătrașcu|date= 2011|title= Orthogonal range searching on the RAM, revisited |journal= [[Symposium on Computational Geometry]]|pages= 1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log ^\epsilon n + k \log ^\epsilon n)&lt;/math&gt; query time
* &lt;math&gt;O(n \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log n + k \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt; query time
* &lt;math&gt;O(n \log ^\epsilon n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time

In the orthogonal case, if one of the bounds is [[infinity]], the query is called three-sided. If two of the bounds are infinity, the query is two-sided, and if none of the bounds are infinity, then the query is four-sided.

=== Dynamic range searching ===
While in static range searching the set ''S'' is known in advance, [[Dynamization|dynamic]] range searching, insertions and deletions of points are allowed. In the incremental version of the problem, only insertions are allowed, whereas the decremental version only allows deletions. For the orthogonal case, [[Kurt Mehlhorn]] and Stefan Näher created a data structure for dynamic range searching which uses [[fractional cascading#Dynamic fractional cascading|dynamic fractional cascading]] to achieve &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O(\log n \log \log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn90"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mehlhorn|first1= Kurt|author1-link=Kurt Mehlhorn|last2= Näher|first2= Stefan|date= 1990|title= Dynamic fractional cascading |journal= [[Algorithmica]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages= 215–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both incremental and decremental versions of the problem can be solved with &lt;math&gt;O(\log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time, but it is unknown whether general dynamic range searching can be done with that query time.

=== Colored range searching ===
The problem of colored range counting considers the case where points have [[categorical variable|categorical]] attributes. If the categories are considered as colors of points in geometric space, then a query is for how many colors appear in a particular range. Prosenjit Gupta and others described a data structure in 1995 which solved 2D orthogonal colored range counting in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2\log ^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O(\log ^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Gupta95"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gupta|first1= Prosenjit|last2= Janardan|first2= Ravi|last3=Smid|first3=Michiel|date= 1995|title= Further results on generalized intersection searching problems: Counting, reporting, and dynamization |journal= [[Journal of Algorithms]]|volume=19|issue=2|pages= 282–317 |doi=10.1006/jagm.1995.1038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
In addition to being considered in [[computational geometry]], range searching, and orthogonal range searching in particular, has applications for [[range query (database)|range queries]] in [[database|databases]]. Colored range searching is also used for and motivated by searching through categorical data. For example, determining the rows in a database of bank accounts which represent people whose age is between 25 and 40 and who have between $10000 and $20000 might be an orthogonal range reporting problem where age and money are two dimensions.

In [[computer science]], the '''sleeping barber problem''' is a classic [[inter-process communication]] and [[synchronization]] problem between multiple [[operating system]] [[Process (computing)|processes]]. The problem is analogous to that of keeping a barber working when there are customers, resting when there are none, and doing so in an orderly manner.

The analogy is based upon a hypothetical barber shop with one barber. The barber has one barber's chair in a cutting room and a waiting room containing a number of chairs in it. When the barber finishes cutting a customer's hair, he dismisses the customer and goes to the waiting room to see if there are others waiting. If there are, he brings one of them back to the chair and cuts their hair. If there are none, he returns to the chair and sleeps in it.

Each customer, when they arrive, looks to see what the barber is doing. If the barber is sleeping, the customer wakes him up and sits in the cutting room chair. If the barber is cutting hair, the customer stays in the waiting room. If there is a free chair in the waiting room, the customer sits in it and waits their turn. If there is no free chair, the customer leaves. 

Based on a naïve analysis, the above decisions should ensure that the shop functions correctly, with the barber cutting the hair of anyone who arrives until there are no more customers, and then sleeping until the next customer arrives. In practice, there are a number of problems that can occur that are illustrative of general scheduling problems.

The problems are all related to the fact that the actions by both the barber and the customer (checking the waiting room, entering the shop, taking a waiting room chair, etc.) all take an unknown amount of time.  For example, a customer may arrive and observe that the barber is cutting hair, so he goes to the waiting room. While they're on their way, the barber finishes their current haircut and goes to check the waiting room. Since there is no one there (the customer not having arrived yet), he goes back to their chair and sleeps. The barber is now waiting for a customer, but the customer is waiting for the barber. In another example, two customers may arrive at the same time when there happens to be a single seat in the waiting room. They observe that the barber is cutting hair, go to the waiting room, and both attempt to occupy the single chair.

The Sleeping Barber Problem is often attributed to [[Edsger Dijkstra]] (1965), one of the pioneers in computer science.

Many possible solutions are available. The key element of each is a [[mutex]], which ensures that only one of the participants can change state at once. The barber must acquire/enforce this mutual exclusion (of room status) before checking for customers and release it when they begin either to sleep or cut hair. A customer must acquire it before entering the shop and release it once they are sitting in either a waiting room chair or the barber chair, and also when they leave the shop because no seats were available. This eliminates both of the problems mentioned in the previous section. A number of [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] is also required to indicate the state of the system. For example, one might store the number of people in the waiting room.

A ''multiple sleeping barbers problem'' has the additional complexity of coordinating several barbers among the waiting customers.

== Implementation ==
*The following [[pseudocode]] guarantees synchronization between barber and customer and is [[deadlock]] free, but may lead to [[Resource starvation |starvation]] of a customer. The problem of starvation can be solved by utilizing a queue where customers are added as they arrive, so that barber can serve them on a first come first served basis (FIFO =&gt; First In, First Out) The functions wait() and signal() are functions provided by the [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]]. In c-code notation, a wait() is a P() and a signal() is a V().

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
# The first two are mutexes (only 0 or 1 possible)
Semaphore barberReady = 0
Semaphore accessWRSeats = 1     # if 1, the number of seats in the waiting room can be incremented or decremented
Semaphore custReady = 0         # the number of customers currently in the waiting room, ready to be served
int numberOfFreeWRSeats = N     # total number of seats in the waiting room

def Barber():
  while true:                   # Run in an infinite loop.
    wait(custReady)             # Try to acquire a customer - if none is available, go to sleep.
    wait(accessWRSeats)         # Awake - try to get access to modify # of available seats, otherwise sleep.
    numberOfFreeWRSeats += 1    # One waiting room chair becomes free.
    signal(barberReady)         # I am ready to cut.
    signal(accessWRSeats)       # Don't need the lock on the chairs anymore.
    # (Cut hair here.)

def Customer():
  while true:                   # Run in an infinite loop to simulate multiple customers.
    wait(accessWRSeats)         # Try to get access to the waiting room chairs.
    if numberOfFreeWRSeats &gt; 0: # If there are any free seats:
      numberOfFreeWRSeats -= 1  #   sit down in a chair
      signal(custReady)         #   notify the barber, who's waiting until there is a customer
      signal(accessWRSeats)     #   don't need to lock the chairs anymore
      wait(barberReady)         #   wait until the barber is ready
      # (Have hair cut here.)
    else:                       # otherwise, there are no free seats; tough luck --
      signal(accessWRSeats)     #   but don't forget to release the lock on the seats!
      # (Leave without a haircut.)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Stand level modelling''' is a type of modelling in the [[forest sciences]] in which the main unit is a forested stand.

A '''forest stand''' is a contiguous [[Plant community|community]] of [[tree]]s sufficiently uniform in composition, structure, [[Forest inventory#Timber metrics|age and size class]] distribution, spatial arrangement, site quality, condition, or location to distinguish it from adjacent communities.&lt;ref&gt;Nyland, Ralph D. (2007). ''Silviculture: concepts and applications'', 2nd ed. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forest]] is a "collection of stands".&lt;ref&gt;Nyland, Ralph D. (2007). ''Silviculture: concepts and applications'',pg 5, 2nd ed. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stand description==

A forest stand is commonly described as in 10ths or 10%s. Thus a ratio could be given of: 3 Ponderosa pines, 2 mangrove trees, 5 silver spruces. If there was a mixed stand that stand mix could be described as mixed up to 10%, mixed 10–40% and a mixed stand over that amount.

The form of mixing of the tree types is commonly given as:

* individuals – when there are a few unconnected trees of a type.
* troop – up to 5 trees connected of one type.
* group – when there are more than 5 trees, but they are shorter than a harvestable tree.
* thicket – when there are more than 5 trees, but they are taller than a harvestable tree to around 0.5 ha.
* rotten group (cluster) –  a packed together standing aggregate of trees, trees in the rotten group have different heights and different depths or a stripwise arrangement. Rotten is from German, ''Rotte'' and means pack. These trees are linked together in small rotten groups separated by bigger interstices. This means they are ideal for mountain [[afforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waldwissen.net/waldwirtschaft/waldbau/bergwald/wsl_rottenaufforstung/index_DE&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stand spacing==

A stand's spacing may be described by the [[Crown closure|crown cover]] of the trees. It can thus be delimited as:

*Packed – the crowns all overlap when looked at from above
*Closed – the crowns all touch, but do not overlap
*Light – when there is space between the crowns that is even
*Spacey/gappy – when a few trees are close and yet there are many clearings between these little groups

==Purpose==

Stands are not logical, ecologically defined management units. Instead they have evolved from the Normalwald concept, which was predicated on the idea of harvesting efficiency and thus that forest land was primarily to generate income from timber production. Stands allow easier [[forest inventory]] and [[Forest management|planning]]. The concept has by way of extension been applied across all forestry practice in the world, but originated in the ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' of the late 18th and early 19th century with the [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] tradition, [[Prussian education system|Prussian education]] and emergence of [[Forestry#History|modern silviculture]].

Along with the Normalwald concept has come the idea that stands are standardized in terms of size, species mix, [[Silviculture#Classification by age|age class]] and other [[Forest inventory#Timber metrics|tree metrics]] and that forestry should aim to impose this on nature where it has not existed up till now.&lt;ref&gt;A Ctitique of Silviculture Managing for Complexity K.J. Puettmann, K D. Coates and C. Messier 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

As stand is from an economic timber forestry perspective, it is very focused on the tree element of forests. It is not considerate of the other elements within a forest such as shrubs, animals or topography and alternative terms may better fit ecological or other land value purposes within forests. The English term [[Grove (nature)|grove]] is one example. Also proposed is ''eco-unit''.&lt;ref&gt;Forests: Elements of Silvology by Roelof A.A. Oldeman 624pp 2012 {{ISBN|9783642752117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms may also work, but be on different scales, such as [[coppicing|copse]] or [[woodland]]. To be useful in [[silviculture]] such terms must be clearly defined and consistently applied. Lacking that stand is likely to remain the preferred unit to be used by [[forester]]s and others managing forests, despite its limitations.

The '''Swiss Nanoscience Institute''' (SNI) at the University of Basel is a center of excellence for nanosciences and nanotechnology. In the SNI network, interdisciplinary teams of scientists conduct basic and applied research and actively support knowledge and technology transfer to industry. Within the study of nanoscience and the PhD School, the SNI trains young scientists and prepares them for careers in industry and academia.

The SNI was founded in 2006 by the Canton of Aargau and the University of Basel to promote research and training in the nanosciences and nanotechnology in Northwestern Switzerland. Since then, numerous research projects have been successfully initiated in which researchers from various disciplines and institutions work together in one network. In addition to research and training, the SNI is also involved in public relations and provides targeted support for various initiatives, particularly those aiming to interest children and young people in the natural sciences.

== SNI network ==

The success of the SNI is based on the interdisciplinary network that has been built up and consolidated over the years. This network includes various departments at the University of Basel, the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Department for Biosystems Science and Engineering at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Basel (D-BSSE) and the CSEM (Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique) in Muttenz. Membership of the SNI, which is earned by participating in SNI projects, and regular academic conferences involving its members constantly stimulate and encourage the exchange of information within the network.

== Bachelor and Master Program ==

In 2002, the University of Basel – under the leadership of the SNI’s predecessor institution – launched the Bachelor’s and master's degree programs in nanosciences. Today, this demanding degree program is firmly established. Around 40 students who begin the Bachelor’s program each year receive a solid basic education in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and can subsequently choose from a wide range of courses that allow the students to focus on specific topics. Early on in their education, they have the opportunity to participate in various research groups, an activity that always proves particularly motivating.

== PhD School ==
 
To promote the further training of young scientists and a wide spectrum of basic scientific research, the SNI initiated a PhD School in 2013. At the end of 2014, 24 doctoral students were enrolled. Within the SNI PhD School, each doctoral student is supervised by two members of the SNI network. They also become involved in internal events such as the Winter School and the Annual Meeting and take part in various courses to gain insights into areas such as intellectual property, communication and rhetoric.

== Leaders in their field ==
 
Basic sciences form the foundation of research work at the SNI. In addition to the various projects funded as part of the PhD School, the SNI also supports the basic scientific research performed by Argovia professors Roderick Lim and Martino Poggio. Both were promoted to associate professor in 2014 and their research successes in nanobiology and nanotechnology have contributed to the SNI’s outstanding international reputation. The SNI also supports titular professors Frithjof Nolting and Thomas Jung, who work in the Department of Physics at the University of Basel and at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and, from the end of 2014, Michel Kenzelmann who also works for the PSI and the Department of Physics.

== Practical application ==

Since it was founded, the SNI has placed great value on the transfer of academic findings to industry. To optimize this process, the SNI started an annual call for applied research projects. This program entitled Nano Argovia supports about ten projects each year from broad ranging areas of nanotechnology in close collaboration with industrial companies in Northwestern Switzerland and has a total budget of around 1.5 million Swiss francs. With the Nano Argovia program, the SNI is building an important bridge between research and application. In several cases, this collaboration has led to Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) and other follow-on projects.

== Services ==

The SNI views itself not only as a pure research institution, but also provides various services to industrial companies. In excellently equipped workshops for technology, electronics and mechanics, internal groups and industrial companies can harness the in-depth knowledge of the staff and the outstanding technical resources of the SNI and the affiliated departments.

== Sharing the fascination with others ==

The SNI wishes to involve the public in its fascination with the natural sciences through active communication and participation in various events. For example, the SNI team is actively involved in science festivals and fairs both at home and abroad, provides schools and groups of interested visitors with an insight into everyday laboratory life, and strives to make scientific achievement

The '''Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation (Fedoruk Centre)''' is an institute located in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] that was established by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in 2011 as the Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation (CCNI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Canadian_nuclear_research_centre_secures_funding-2302124.html|title=World Nuclear News - Canadian nuclear research centre secures funding |date=23 February 2012|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fedoruk Centre does not have a mandate to conduct research itself. Instead, it acts as a conduit to fund nuclear released research projects in Saskatchewan and to oversee the operation of nuclear facilities on the University campus such as the universities cyclotron facility.&lt;ref name="on_camp_news"&gt;{{Cite journal

The centre builds on other nuclear and accelerator related facilities already on the university campus that include the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]], [[Canadian Light Source]], [[SLOWPOKE reactor]] operated by the [[Saskatchewan Research Council]], and the [[Plasma Physics Laboratory (Saskatchewan)|STOR-M tokamak]].

The centre received an initial $30 million (CDN) in funding to advance research, innovation and training in four areas:
* Advance nuclear medicine and knowledge,
* Develop better materials for widespread applications (energy, health, environment, manufacturing, etc.),
* Improve safety and other engineering of nuclear energy systems, and
* Managing the risks and benefits of nuclear technology for society and our environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/about/impact.php|title=Fedoruk Centre About Us: Impact Areas| accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fedoruk Centre will be responsible for the operations of a $25 million  cyclotron facility being installed in a renovated a building between the Canadian Light Source and the [[Western College of Veterinary Medicine]] to be completed in 2014. The 24 MeV cyclotron will produce radioisotopes for medical imaging research and clinical use, including the province's PET-CT scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/facilities/cyclotron-facility.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210636/http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/facilities/cyclotron-facility.php |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the centre was formed some controversy existed over the governance and independence of the organization with only two board members appointed by the university while the other members have strong ties to the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/follow-the-yellowcake-road|title=Briar Patch Magazine - Follow the yellowcake road| date= Feb 28, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, all members of the Fedoruk Centre's Board of Directors are appointed by the University of Saskatchewan's Board of Governors. Two members are nominated by the Province of Saskatchewan, two by the University of Saskatchewan, with the remainder sought out by the Fedoruk Centre's Board and elected by the Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/about/governance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity''' ('''TEEB''') is a study led by [[Pavan Sukhdev]]. It is an international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of [[biodiversity]]. Its objective is to highlight the growing cost of [[biodiversity loss]] and [[environmental degradation|ecosystem degradation]] and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions. TEEB aims to assess, communicate and mainstream the urgency of actions through its five deliverables&amp;mdash;D0: science and economic foundations, policy costs and costs of inaction, D1: policy opportunities for national and international policy-makers, D2: decision support for local administrators, D3: business risks, opportunities and metrics and D4: citizen and consumer ownership.

One motive for the study was to establish an objective global standard basis for [[natural capital accounting]]. Estimates establish the cost of biodiversity and ecosystem damage expected to cost 18% of global economic output by 2050&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11606228|title=Nature's gift: The economic benefits of preserving the natural world|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently at over US$2T (for the largest 3000 companies according to [[Trucost]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11495812|title=Nature's sting: The real cost of damaging Planet Earth|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=12 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some estimates as high as US$6T/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10103179|title=Nature loss 'to damage economies'|first=Richard|last=Black|date=10 May 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Bank]] in particular has led recent efforts to include the cost of biodiversity and climate harm in national accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11642538|title=World Bank to account for nature|first=Richard|last=Black|date=28 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its sponsors declare TEEB to be a "major international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, to highlight the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teebweb.org|title=The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity - TEEB|website=TEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2010 it released its report "Mainstreaming the Economics of Nature: a synthesis of the approach, conclusions and recommendations of TEEB"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teebweb.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=bYhDohL_TuM=&amp;tabid=924&amp;mid=1813|title=Page Not Found|website=TEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched the [[Bank of Natural Capital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankofnaturalcapital.com|title=Bank of natural – Capital|website=bankofnaturalcapital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to communicate its findings to the general public.

==History==
The TEEB study was launched by Germany and the [[European Commission]] in response to a proposal by the [[G8+5]] Environment Ministers in Potsdam, Germany in 2007, to develop a global study on the [[economics of biodiversity]] loss. The second phase of the TEEB study is hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) with support from a number of organizations, including the European Commission, German [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] and the UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].

Pavan Sukhdev, a senior banker from [[Deutsche Bank]], and founder-director of the [[green accounting]] project GIST (Green Indian States Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gistindia.org/|title=gist|website=gist}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in India. The TEEB Advisory Board includes experts from the fields of science and economics.

The TEEB Interim Report was released in May 2008 under Phase I. The report provided evidence for significant global and local [[economic loss]]es and human welfare impacts due to the ongoing losses of biodiversity and degradation of [[ecosystem]]s. It focused largely on forests and looked at the extent of losses of [[natural capital]] taking place as a result of [[deforestation]] and degradation. TEEB estimates that this is US$2–4.5 trillion per year, every year.

Phase II of the study set out to expand on the work begun in Phase I. It was completed in 2010 and presented in [[Nagoya]], Japan, at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) in October 2010. The final volumes of TEEB are being published by Earthscan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/ Earthscan]&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume published in October 2010: The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Ecological and Economic Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=102480|title=Environment &amp; Sustainability - Routledge|website=Routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, third and fourth volumes will be published over the course of 2011.

==Phase i: key messages==
The world has already lost much of its biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Novacek, M.J. and Cleland, E.E. (2001). "The current biodiversity extinction event: Scenarios for mitigation and recovery". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' (98):11, 5466–5470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, R.J. and Biggs, R. (2005). "A biodiversity intactness index". ''Nature'' 434, 45–49&lt;/ref&gt; TEEB indicates that pressure on [[commodity]] and food prices shows the consequences of this loss to society. TEEB recommends that urgent remedial action is essential because [[species loss]] and ecosystem degradation are inextricably linked to human well-being. Economic growth and the conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural production are forecasted to continue, but TEEB feels that it is essential to ensure that such development takes proper account of the real value of natural ecosystems. This is central to both economic and [[environmental management]].

The findings of TEEB (Interim Report) were largely in three areas&amp;mdash;the economic size and welfare impact of losses of ecosystems and biodiversity, the strong links between biodiversity [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and ecosystem health on the one hand and poverty elimination and the achievement of Millennium Development Goals on the other, and the ethical choices involved in selecting a social discount rate for discounting the benefits of ecosystems and biodiversity.

===Main findings===
* 11% of the natural areas remaining in 2000 could be lost, chiefly as a result of conversion for agriculture, the expansion of infrastructure, and climate change.
* Almost 40% of the land currently under low-impact forms of agriculture could be converted to intensive agricultural use, with further biodiversity losses.
* It is estimated that for an annual investment of US$45 billion into protected areas alone, the delivery of [[ecosystem services]] worth some US$5 trillion a year could be secured.

TEEB finds that sound [[ecosystem management|ecosystem]] and biodiversity management, and the inclusion of natural capital in governmental and business accounting can start to redress inaction and reduce the cost of future losses.

==Phase II==
TEEB Phase II, currently underway, takes an economic approach that is spatially specific and builds on knowledge of how ecosystems function and deliver [[Service (economics)|services]]. It examines how ecosystems and their associated services are likely to respond to particular policy actions. A fundamental focus of TEEB is on developing an economic yardstick that is more effective than [[GDP]] for assessing the performance of an economy. TEEB recommends that [[national accounting]] systems need to be more inclusive in order to measure the significant human welfare benefits that ecosystems and biodiversity provide. Such systems can help policy makers adopt the right measures and design appropriate financing mechanisms for conservation.

In Phase II TEEB aims to:

* Integrate [[ecology|ecological]] and economic knowledge to structure the evaluation of [[ecosystem services]] under different scenarios.
* Recommend appropriate [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] methodologies for different contexts.
* Examine the economic costs of biodiversity decline and the costs and benefits of actions to reduce these losses.
* Develop ‘toolkits’ for policy makers at international, regional and local levels to foster [[sustainable development]] and better conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.
* Enable easy access to leading information and tools for improved biodiversity practice for the business community&amp;mdash;from the perspective of managing risks, addressing opportunities, and measuring impacts.
* Raise public awareness of the individual’s impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, and areas where individual action can make a positive difference.

==Climate issues update==
TEEB's Climate Update stated that an agreement on funding for forests was a key priority for governments attending the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen.

An estimated 5 gigatonnes or 15% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed or 'sequestrated' by forests every year, making them the "mitigation engine" of the natural world.

TEEB finds that investing in ecosystem-based measures such as financing [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) can thus assist in combating [[climate change]] and can also be a key anti-poverty and adaptation measure.

The Update also underlines a 'Coral Reef Emergency' that is already here as a result of the current build-up of greenhouse gases. Scientists contributing to the TEEB process indicate that irreversible damage to coral reefs can occur at atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations of over 350 parts per million (ppm). This is linked with rising temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. Concentrations are above this threshold and rising. It raises concerns that stabilizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at 450 ppm, or some 16% above the current levels, may condemn this critical, multibillion-dollar ecosystem to extinction and take with it the livelihoods of 500 million people within a matter of decades.

==Green economy initiative==
The UNEP's [[green economy]] initiative is a project designed to communicate that the [[green economy|greening of economies]] is not a burden on growth but rather a new engine for growth, employment, and the reduction of persistent global poverty. The [[green economy]] report, published in February 2011, used economic analysis and modelling approaches to provide an in-depth assessment of identified economic sectors where "greening" might lead to prosperity and job creation (i.e. traditional economic growth). This promotes sectors regarded as necessary for a [[green economy]] such as: agriculture, buildings, cities, fishery, forests, industry, [[renewable energy]], transport, tourism, [[waste management]], and water as well as the enabling conditions in finance, domestic and international policy architecture.

==Criticism==
The approach to valuing ecosystems encapsulated by the TEEB project has been criticized and is open to the same problems as affect all mainstream [[economic value]] theories.  More specifically the argument is that prices need to be corrected for [[market failure]] and simple adjustments can be made to correct the price system so resources will be allocated efficiently. The basis for this recalculation is human preferences for nature, ecosystems, bugs and plants.  One critique concerns the irrelevance of human preferences for determining what is ecologically essential for the maintenance of life support systems. Human preferences may be a good guide to choosing ice cream flavors but not the mix of species or gases in the atmosphere necessary to sustain life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_Ecosystem_Value_EV_2008.pdf|title=Spash, C.L. 2008. How much is that ecosystem in the window? The one with the bio-diverse trail. Environmental Values, vol. 17, no. 2, 259-284|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond criticism of the actual calculations being used in these TEEB studies and associated work there is the institutional implications.  Pavan Sukdev argues for a financial and banking sector response which will 'capture values'. This basically means making [[Profit (economics)|profits]] for those prepared to develop and trade new financial instruments and fund financial initiatives which will trade biodiversity and ecosystem assets as new [[financial asset]]s. This is seen by some as the hidden agenda of TEEB as it has been backed by financial interests including being headed by a former [[Deutsche Bank]] financier. Clive Spash refers to TEEB as "terrible economics, ecosystems and banking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spash, C. L.|year=2011|title=Terrible economics, ecosystems and banking|journal=Environmental Values|volume=20|issue=2|pages=141–145|doi=10.3197/096327111X12997574391562}}&lt;/ref&gt;
