{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}
An '''acceleration clause''' —or '''acceleration covenant'''— in the [[law]] of [[contracts]], is a term that fully matures the performance due from a party upon a breach of the contract. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/acceleration_clause&lt;/ref&gt; Such clauses are most prevalent in [[mortgages]] and similar contracts to purchase [[real estate]] in installments.

Suppose, for example, the contract was for A to purchase [[Blackacre]] from B for $100,000, to be paid in 5 monthly installments of $20,000. If A makes the first two payments, but fails to make the third payment, an acceleration clause would require that A must immediately pay B the entire balance of $60,000, or lose his right to purchase Blackacre (without getting a refund of his $40,000).

An example of an acceleration clause is examined in the 1971 Rhode Island Supreme Court case of ''Scullian v. Petrucci'':&lt;ref&gt;''Scullian v. Petrucci'', 276 A.2d 277, 108 R.I. 406 (R.I., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; There, the clause stated: "In the event Purchaser defaults on any payment or fails to comply with any condition of this contract [...] the full amount shall be immediately due and payable[...]". The court in that case found that the language of the clause required that default on the payment triggered the [[statute of limitations]] for the clause to be enforced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9995">'''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly''' is a registered [[certification mark]] operated by Allergy Standards Limited in association with not-for-profit [[asthma]] and/or [[allergy]] organizations, labeling products which have been put through and have passed standardised testing. 
The ''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly'' Certification Program was created to scientifically test and identify consumer products that are more suitable for people with asthma and allergies.

==Background==
The avoidance of [[asthma]] triggers and/or [[allergens]] has been recognised by many clinicians and researchers as being an integral part of an asthma management plan.&lt;ref&gt;Walshaw and Evans, Q J Med, 1986{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capristo et al, Allergy, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platts-Mills, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;O'Connor, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2005{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan et al, NEJM, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been some discussion as to whether [[dust mite]] avoidance measures will result in a clinically relevant outcome&lt;ref&gt;Gotzsche, Lancet, 2007{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock et al, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Platts-Mills, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2008{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting debate has given rise to a recommendation by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] that an asthma management plan should include avoidance of as many allergens as possible to which the individual is sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Third International Workshop. JACI vol. 100: no.6, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; This report and others&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; also assert that no single specific measure is sufficient to reduce allergens: An allergen reduction plan, which encompasses a variety of approaches is necessary to address management of asthma symptoms.

==The Certification Mark==
''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly'' is a registered certification mark operated by Allergy Standards Limited&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt; in association with not-for-profit asthma and/or allergy organizations in the country of operation. Products are subjected to standardised testing and if they pass, are deemed ''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly''. The Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly Certification Program has been implemented in a number of countries, such as: 
* The United States (in association with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]]), 
&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:US-General-mark.jpg|thumb|asthma &amp; allergy friendly® US mark]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Canada (in association with [[Asthma Canada]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asthma.ca/adults/ asthma.ca/adults/ "Asthma Canada"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004323/http://asthma.ca/adults/ |date=2009-02-13 }}. asthma.ca  Asthma Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:Canada general-mark.jpg|thumb|asthma &amp; allergy friendly® Canadian mark]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Internationally (operated by Allergy Standards&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The allergen immunoassay sampling and analysis for the certification program is carried out by various accredited partner laboratories such as Berkeley Analytical, [[Testex]] and Airmid Healthgroup specialised in environmental testings and in particular for allergy and asthma,  [[microbiology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[aerobiology]]. Testing is conducted at a uniquely integrated testing facility which combines molecular biology, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) with state of the art air sampling and particle counting in a highly sophisticated [[Environmental test chambers|environmental test chamber]] facility with a microbiological aerosol capability.

==The Certification Process==
=== Overview of the standards ===
Products bearing the certification mark must come through our rigorous testing standards. Standards assess products for the presence of allergenic dyes and sensitizing chemicals &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26708986_Chemical_allergens-What_are_the_issues “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?”]. Kimber, Ian, David A. Basketter, and Rebecca J. Dearman. 2010. “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?” Toxicology 268(3): 139–42. access-date=2018-08-28 &lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the capacity for allergen retention and ability to withstand eradication techniques such as repeated washing machine cycles &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:6330:ed-3:v1:en "ISO 6330:2012(en) Textiles — Domestic washing and drying procedures for textile testing"]. iso.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Product areas that have been certified include textile materials, electrical appliances, building products and kids toys &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/INT/certified-products "Certified Products"]. asthmaandallergyfriendly.com &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Objective ===
The Certification Program aims to help consumers make an informed choice when buying products. When consumers see the distinctive mark on a product, they know they are buying an asthma &amp; allergy friendly® product that has come through stringent testing to a series of standards developed by medical and healthcare experts and peer-reviewed by practicing allergology clinicians &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergy standards.com &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aafa.org "Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America"]. aafa.org &lt;/ref&gt;. The number of Certification Standards continues to grow in order to encompass a wide range of products, and help manufacturers to develop healthier products for people with asthma and allergies.

=== Prerequisites ===
Products seeking to be certified ''asthma &amp; allergy friendly'' must pass Allergy Standards rigorous testing standards.  Manufacturers must submit their products for testing to Allergy Standards Ltd approved third party laboratories &lt;ref&gt;[https://berkeleyanalytical.com  "Berkeley Analytical"]. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airmidhealthgroup.com  "Airmid Health Group"]. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://ibr-usa.com   "IBR USA"]. &lt;/ref&gt;. Products must be  submitted from current production and consumer ready. In order to pass the standards, products must meet the criteria of the standard relevant to the product category. 

=== Laboratory tests ===
Certification Standards are tailored to the specific product categories. Criteria in the standards may include low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, free from banned dyes and allergens according to best international practice&lt;ref&gt;[https://echa.europa.eu/home "European Chemicals Agency"]. &lt;/ref&gt;, and capable of either providing a barrier to allergens or effectively removing allergen from the environment. Importantly, products must also demonstrate that they are capable of carrying out their function effectively and are of acceptable quality and construction. For example textiles must be evaluated for barrier function, but must also demonstrate barrier function after washing.  Vacuum cleaners must demonstrate effective allergen removal, but this is also assessed when the bag is near capacity, demonstrating no significant loss of power and no redistribution of dust and allergens.


==Allergy Standards Limited==
Allergy Standards Limited is an International Standards and Certification Body that prepares independent standards for a wide range of products to declare their suitability for people whose lives are affected by allergies and asthma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com  Allergy Standards Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Their headquarters are based in Dublin, Ireland.

==Certified Companies==
[[Dyson (company)]] has been certified since 2015 with the launch of their Dyson Humidifier and have also certified several of their floor care products with their vacuum cleaners, both full-size upright and canister vacuums as well as the cord free vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/allergy.html "Dyson Allergy"]. dyson.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[True Value]] Company has been certified since July 2018 with the EasyCare range of paints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/27/1543404/0/en/Low-Odor-Paint-Offers-a-Healthier-Solution-for-Your-Home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The multinational company [[Tarkett]] specialised in the production of floor has also passed the scientific standards to be certified and offers various ranges of flooring certified asthma &amp; allergy friendly®.&lt;ref&gt; https://residential.tarkett.com/en_US/node/asthma-allergy-friendly-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LG]] has also get the asthma &amp; allergy friendly® certification for a large range of products including washing machines, air purifiers and clothing steam systems. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lg.com/us/aafa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business acumen''' ("Business savvy" and "business sense" are often used as synonyms) is keenness and quickness in understanding and dealing with a "business situation" ([[risk management|risks]] and [[Opportunity management|opportunities]]) in a manner that is likely to lead to a good outcome.&lt;ref name=reilly&gt;Reilly, Dr. Raymond R and Reilly, Dr. Gregory P. [http://www.acumenlearning.com/public/images/uploaded/reilly-building_business_acumen-hrwest1209.pdf "Building Business Acumen"], ''HR West'', December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, business acumen has emerged as a vehicle for improving financial performance and [[leadership development]].&lt;ref name=summerfield&gt;Summerfield, Brian. [http://www.clomedia.com/executive-briefings/2008/April/2175/index.php "A Crisis in Leadership"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623215033/http://www.clomedia.com/executive-briefings/2008/April/2175/index.php |date=June 23, 2009 }}, ''Chief Learning Officer Magazine'', April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, several different types of strategies have developed around improving business acumen.

== Characteristics ==

=== Executive level thinking ===

In his 2012 work, ''[[Seeing the Big Picture]], Business Acumen to Build Your Credibility, Career, and Company'', [[Kevin R. Cope]] put forward that an individual who possesses business acumen views the business with an "executive mentality" - they understand how the moving parts of a company work together to make it successful and how financial metrics like [[profit margin]], [[cash flow]], and [[stock price]] reflect how well each of those moving parts is doing its job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing the Big Picture|publisher=Greenleaf Book Group|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60832-246-6|location=USA|page=2|last1=Cope|first1=Kevin}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2012-06-25--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cope proposes that an individual who has the following five abilities could be described as someone having a strong sense of business acumen: 
#See the “big picture” of the organization—how the key drivers of the business relate to each other, work together to produce profitable growth, and relate to the job
#Understand important company communications and data, including [[financial statement]]s
#Use knowledge to make good decisions
#Understand how actions and decisions impact key company measures and leadership objectives 
#Effectively communicate ideas to other employees, managers, executives, [[public relations|and the public]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing the Big Picture|publisher=Greenleaf Book Group|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60832-246-6|location=USA|page=3|last1=Cope|first1=Kevin}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2012-06-25--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinguishing traits ===

Raymond R. Reilly of the [[Ross School of Business]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and Gregory P. Reilly of the University of Connecticut document traits that individuals with business acumen possess: 
* An acute perception of the dimensions of business issues
* Ability to make sense out of complexity and an uncertain future
* Cognizance of the implications of a choice for all the affected parties
* Decisive
* Flexibility for further change if warranted in the future
Thus, developing stronger business acumen means a more thoughtful analysis, clearer logic underlying business decisions, closer attention to key dimensions of implementation and operation, and more disciplined performance management.&lt;ref name="reilly"/&gt;

=== Financial literacy ===

[[Financial literacy]] is a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of growth, profitability, and cash flow; an organization's financial statements; key performance measures; and the implications of decisions on value creation. In a [[SHRM]] article entitled, "Business Acumen Involves More Than Numbers"&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;Hastings, Rebecca R. [http://www.shrmindia.org/business-acumen-involves-more-numbers "Business Acumen Involves More Than Numbers"], ''SHRM'', April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Berger, member of human resources at CTPartners,&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2015/06/28/troubled-ctpartners-set-to-file-for-bankruptcy/&lt;/ref&gt; explains that business acumen starts with the ability to understand how a company makes decisions, and that leaders must be financially literate and be able to understand numbers on company financial statements. It entails the ability to take the knowledge of business fundamentals and use it to think strategically and then take appropriate action.

According to [[E. Ted Prince]], "Financial literacy is almost never the need for senior managers and high potentials. Most already possess degrees in business, including [[MBA]]s, and many have also had experience in the business sides of their professional roles. The need for these managers is to understand how their actions and their behavior impact their financial decision-making and how this in turn affects financial outcomes at the unit and the corporate level." It's evident that an individual with business acumen has some level of financial understanding and knowledge - but someone who is financially literate doesn't necessarily possess strong business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perthleadership.org/documents/Business_Acumen_WP_Updated.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business management and leadership ===

Bob Selden, faculty member of Mobilizing People, a [[leadership development]] program based in Switzerland, observes a complementary relationship between business acumen and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, Bob. [http://www.management-issues.com/2008/2/26/opinion/is-business-acumen-a-substitute-for-leadership.asp "Is Business Acumen a Substitute for Leadership?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719105324/http://www.management-issues.com/2008/2/26/opinion/is-business-acumen-a-substitute-for-leadership.asp |date=July 19, 2008 }}, 26 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Selden states the importance of nurturing both the development of strategic skills and that of good leadership and management skills in order for business leaders to achieve effectiveness.

A study published in Human Resource Management International Digest titled, Business acumen: a critical concern of modern leadership development: Global trends accelerate the move away from traditional approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prince |first1=Ted |year=2008 |title=Business acumen: a critical concern of modern leadership development: Global trends accelerate the move away from traditional approaches |journal=Human Resource Management International Digest |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=6–9 |publisher= |doi= |url= http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1741949&amp;show=abstract |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveals why traditional leadership development approaches, which rely on personality and competency assessments as the scientific core of their approach, are failing. The paper demonstrates the importance of business acumen in leadership-development approaches and contends that business acumen will have an increasing impact on leadership development and HR agendas. Research into this relationship resulted in the creation of the [[Perth Leadership Outcome Model]], which links [http://www.perthleadership.org/index.php/business-acumen-training/assessments/financial-outcome-assessment financial outcomes] to individual leadership traits.

In a study that interviewed 55 global business leaders, business acumen was cited as the most critical competency area for global leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leadership Without Borders|last=Cohen|first=Ed|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-82227-2|location=USA|page=14}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2011-02-18--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2011 work, ''The Leadership Pipeline'', [[Ram Charan (consultant)|Ram Charan]], Stephen Drotter, and James Noel study the process and criteria for selecting a group manager, and suggest that the process and criteria are similar for selecting a CEO. According to them an obvious criterium for selecting a leader is well-developed business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Leadership Pipeline|last2=Noel|first2=James|last3=Drotter|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-89456-9|location=USA|page=139|last1=Charan|first1=Ram}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2011-02-18--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization full of high business acumen individuals can expect to see leaders with a heightened perspective that translates into an ability to inspire and excite the organization to achieve its potential.&lt;ref name="reilly"/&gt;

==Development==
Programs designed to improve an individual or group's business acumen have supported the recognition of the concept as a significant topic in the corporate world. Executive Development Associates' 2009/2010 survey of Chief Learning Officers, Senior Vice Presidents of Human Resources, and Heads of Executive and Leadership Development listed business acumen as the second most significant trend in executive development.&lt;ref name=hagemann&gt;Hagemann, Bonnie [http://www.hreonline.com/pdfs/02012010Extra_LeadershipStudy.pdf "2009/2010 Trends in Executive Development"], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 report explores the impact of business acumen training on an organization in terms of intangibles and more tangible expressions of value.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;Anderson, Dr. Merrill C. [http://www.acumenlearning.com/public/images/uploaded/roi-business-acumen.pdf "MetrixGlobal Study of Business Acumen Training"], March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings support the notion that business acumen is a learned skill - developed on the job by learning the required skills from knowledge mentors while working in different employment positions. They also suggest that the learning process ranges widely, from structured internal company training programs, to an individual's self-chosen moves from one position to another.&lt;ref name="reilly"/&gt;

The combination of these reports and surveys indicate that business acumen is a learned skill of increasing importance within the corporate world. There are different types of business acumen development programs available:

=== Business simulations ===

A [[business simulation]] is another corporate development tool used to increase business acumen. Several companies offer business simulations as a way to educate mid-level managers and non-financial leaders within their organization on [[cash flow]] and financial-decision-making processes. Their forms can vary from computer simulations to boardgame-style simulations.

=== Psychological assessments ===

The advent of personal assessments for business acumen is based in the emerging theories of [[behavioral finance]] and attempts to correlate innate personality traits with positive financial outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Perth Leadership Institute White Paper:[http://www.perthleadership.org/Documents/Business_Acumen_WP_Updated.pdf ''Business Acumen and Leadership Development for CEOs and Senior Executives'']&lt;/ref&gt; This method approaches business acumen not as entirely based in either knowledge or experience, but on the combination of these and other factors which comprise an individual's financial personality or "signature". The results from this research have been limited, but noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, E. Ted. "Research note: how the financial styles of managers impact financial and valuation metrics." [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1728141 ''Review of Accounting and Finance''] 7.2 (2008):193-205&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chester Irving Barnard''' (November 7, 1886 – June 7, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] business [[Senior management|executive]], public administrator, and the author of pioneering work in [[management]] theory and [[organizational studies]]. His landmark 1938 book, ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]'', sets out a [[organization theory|theory of organization]] and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in [[management]] theory and [[industrial sociology|organizational sociology]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9199394 Chester (Irving) Barnard Biography (1886 - 1961)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on biography.com. Retrieved 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[efficiency]].

== Biography ==
In his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then studied economics at [[Harvard University]], earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.&lt;ref name = "RCST"&gt;R.C.S. Trahair (1994) "Barnard's executive functions" in ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard joined the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (now AT&amp;T) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the [[New Jersey Bell Telephone Company]]. During the [[Great Depression]], he directed the New Jersey state relief system.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], 1948–52, and as chairman of the [[National Science Foundation]], 1952-54.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; End 1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].

== Work ==
Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]]. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard's meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the [[Motivation|motives]] of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last.

Barnard was a great admirer of [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard’s death in 1961.

=== The Functions of the Executive ===
{{Main|The Functions of the Executive}}
Barnard's classic 1938 book, ''The Functions of the Executive'' discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems.

Barnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: 
* Establishing and maintaining a system of communication;
* Securing essential services from other members;
* Formulating organizational purposes and objectives.
* To manage people and make sure they do their jobs

=== Authority and incentives ===
Barnard formulated two interesting theories: one of [[authority]] and the other of [[incentives]]. Both are seen in the context of a [[communication system]] grounded in seven essential rules: 
* The channels of communication should be definite;
* Everyone should know of the channels of communication;
* Everyone should have access to the formal channels of communication;
* Lines of communication should be as short and as direct as possible;
* Competence of persons serving as communication centers should be adequate;
* The line of communication should not be interrupted when the organization is functioning;
* Every communication should be authenticated.

Thus, what makes a communication [[authoritative]], rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard's perspective had affinities to that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence.

As for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and [[persuasion]]. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. 
The specific incentives were:
# Money and other material inducements;
# Personal non-material opportunities for distinction;
# Desirable physical conditions of work;
# Ideal benefactions, such as [[pride of workmanship]] etc.

The general incentives were:
# Associated attractiveness (based upon compatibility with associates)
# Adaptation of working conditions to habitual methods and attitudes
# The opportunity for the feeling of enlarged participation in the course of events
# The condition of communing with others (personal comfort with social relations, opportunity for comradeship etc., )

==Contract law==
===Common law===
In contract law the contract price is a [[Contract#Uncertainty, incompleteness and severance|material term]].  The contract price is the price for the goods or services to be received in the contract. The contract price helps to  determine whether a contract may exist.  If the contract price is not included in the written contract, then upon litigation the court may hold that a contract did not exist.

In litigation, the contract price is a factor for determining [[damages]] upon a party forsaking its contractual obligations.  The contract price as a point of reference may help determine the [[Expectation damages|expectancy interest]] of the party suffering damages as well as the [[Reliance damages|reliance interest]] along with damages under [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20428">A '''currency crisis''' is a situation in which serious doubt exists as to whether a country's [[central bank]] has sufficient [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]] reserves to maintain the country's [[fixed exchange rate]]. The crisis is often accompanied by a [[speculative attack]] in the foreign exchange market. A currency crisis  results from chronic [[balance of payments]] deficits, and thus is also called a '''balance of payments crisis'''. Often such a crisis culminates in a [[devaluation]] of the currency.

A currency crisis is a type of [[financial crisis]], and is often associated with a [[real economic crisis]]. A currency crisis raises the probability of a banking crisis or a default crisis. During a currency crisis the value of foreign denominated debt will rise drastically relative to the declining value of the home currency. Financial institutions and the government will struggle to meet debt obligations and economic crisis may ensue. Causation also runs the other way. The probability of a currency crisis rises when a country is experiencing a banking or default crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaminsky|first1=Graciela L.|last2=Reinhart|first2=Carmen M.|title=The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payment Problems|journal=American Economic Review|date=1999|volume=89 |issue=3|pages=473–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinhart|first1=Carmen M.|title=Default, Currency Crises, and Sovereign Credit Ratings|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2002|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=151–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; To offset the damage resulting from a banking or default crisis, a central bank will often increase currency issuance, which can decrease reserves to a point where a fixed exchange rate breaks. The linkage between currency, banking, and default crises increases the chance of [[twin crises]] or even triple crises, outcomes in which the economic cost of each individual crisis is enlarged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenstra|first1=Robert Christopher|last2=Taylor|first2=Alan M.|title=International Macroeconomics|date=2014|isbn=9781429278430|page=352|edition=3rd edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currency crises can be especially destructive to small [[open economy|open economies]] or bigger, but not sufficiently stable ones. Governments often take on the role of fending off such attacks by satisfying the [[excess demand]] for a given currency using the country's own currency reserves or its [[foreign reserves]] (usually in the [[United States dollar]], [[Euro]] or [[Pound sterling]]). Currency crises have large, measurable costs on an economy, but the ability to predict the timing and magnitude of crises is limited by theoretical understanding of the complex interactions between macroeconomic fundamentals, investor expectations, and government policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2011/wp11-22bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''Currency Crises'', September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; A currency crisis may also have political implications for those in power. Following a currency crisis a change in the head of government and a change in the finance minister and/or central bank governor are more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Jeffrey A.|title=Mundell-Fleming Lecture: Contractionary Currency Crashes in Developing Countries|journal=IMF Staff Papers|date=2005|volume=52 |issue=2|pages=149–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely accepted definition of a currency crisis, which is normally considered as part of a financial crisis. Kaminsky et al. (1998), for instance, define currency crises as when a weighted average of monthly percentage depreciations in the exchange rate and monthly percentage declines in exchange reserves exceeds its mean by more than three standard deviations. Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crisis as a nominal depreciation of a currency of at least 25% but it is also defined at least 10% increase in the rate of depreciation. In general, a currency crisis can be defined as a situation when the participants in an exchange market come to recognize that a pegged exchange rate is about to fail, causing speculation against the peg that hastens the failure and forces a devaluation or appreciation.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Recessions attributed to currency crises include the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], and the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)]].

== Theories ==
The currency crises and [[sovereign default|sovereign debt crises]] that have occurred with increasing frequency since the [[Latin American debt crisis]] of the 1980s have inspired a huge amount of research. There have been several 'generations' of models of currency crises.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burnside, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo (2008), '[http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/currency%20crisis%20models%20Ed.pdf Currency crisis models]', ''New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First generation===
The 'first generation' of models of currency crises began with [[Paul Krugman]]'s [http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/crises.html adaptation] of [[Stephen Salant]] and Dale Henderson's model of speculative attacks in the gold market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salant | first1 = Stephen | last2 = Henderson | first2 = Dale | year = 1978 | title = Market anticipations of government policies and the price of gold | url = | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 627–48 | doi=10.1086/260702}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krugman | first1 = Paul | year = 1979 | title = 'A model of balance-of-payments crises' | url = | journal = Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 311–25 | doi=10.2307/1991793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman argues that a sudden [[speculative attack]] on a fixed exchange rate, even though it appears to be an irrational change in expectations, can result from rational behavior by investors. This happens if investors foresee that a government is running an excessive deficit, causing it to run short of liquid assets or "harder" foreign currency which it can sell to support its currency at the fixed rate. Investors are willing to continue holding the currency as long as they expect the exchange rate to remain fixed, but they flee the currency ''en masse'' when they anticipate that the peg is about to end.

===Second generation===
The 'second generation' of models of currency crises starts with the paper of Obstfeld (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Obstfeld | first1 = Maurice | year = 1986 | title = 'Rational and self-fulfilling balance-of-payments crises' | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 76 | issue = 1| pages = 72–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these models, doubts about whether the government is willing to maintain its exchange rate peg lead to multiple [[Nash equilibrium|equilibria]], suggesting that [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] may be possible, in which the reason investors attack the currency is that they expect other investors to attack the currency.

===Third generation===
'Third generation' models of currency crises have explored how problems in the banking and financial system interact with currency crises, and how crises can have real effects on the rest of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = R. | last2 = Velasco | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = 'A model of currency crises in emerging markets' | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 116 | issue = 2| pages = 489–517 | doi=10.1162/00335530151144087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinnon &amp; Pill (1996), Krugman (1998), [[Giancarlo Corsetti|Corsetti]], Pesenti, &amp; Roubini (1998) suggested that "over borrowing" by banks to fund moral hazard lending was a form of hidden government debts (to the extent that governments would bail out failing banks).

Radelet &amp; Sachs (1998) suggested that self-fulfilling panics that hit the financial intermediaries, force liquidation of long run assets, which then "confirms" the panics.

Chang and Velasco (2000) argue that a currency crisis may cause a banking crisis if local banks have debts denominated in foreign currency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = R. | last2 = Velasco | first2 = A. | year = 2000 | title = 'Financial fragility and the exchange rate regime' | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1006/jeth.1999.2621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2001 and 2004) argue that a government guarantee of the banking system may give banks an incentive to take on foreign debt, making both the currency and the banking system vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnside | first1 = C. | last2 = Eichenbaum | first2 = M. | last3 = Rebelo | first3 = S. | year = 2001 | title = 'Hedging and financial fragility in fixed exchange rate regimes' | url = | journal = European Economic Review | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1151–93 | doi=10.1016/s0014-2921(01)00090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnside | first1 = C. | last2 = Eichenbaum | first2 = M. | last3 = Rebelo | first3 = S. | year = 2004 | title = 'Government guarantees and self-fulfilling speculative attacks' | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 31–63 | doi=10.1016/j.jet.2003.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman(1999)&lt;ref&gt;Balance Sheets, the Transfer Problem, and Financial Crises. International Finance and Financial Crises: Essays in Honor of Robert P. Flood, Jr. Bosten: Kluwer Academic, 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested another two factors, in an attempt to explain the [[Asian financial crisis]]: (1) firms' balance sheets affect their ability to spend, and (2) capital flows affect the real exchange rate. (He proposed his model as "yet another candidate for third generation crisis modeling" (p32)). However, the banking system plays no role in his model. His model led to the policy prescription: impose a curfew on [[capital flight]] which was [[Economy of Malaysia#Asian financial crisis and recovery|implemented by Malaysia]] during the Asian financial crisis.

==Eurozone crisis as a balance-of-payments crisis==
According to some economists the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Eurozone crisis]] was in fact a balance-of-payments crisis or at least can be thought of as at least as much as a [[Public finance|fiscal]] crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Selected sources on viewing the Eurozone Crisis as a balance-of-payments crisis:

Then following the global [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], came a [[Sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]] to these capital inflows that in some cases even led to a total reversal, i.e. a [[capital flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudden stops in the Eurozone|author1-first=Jean|author1-last=Pisani-Ferry|author1-link=Jean Pisani-Ferry|author2-first=Silvia|author2-last=Merler|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/public-capital-flows-replacing-private-flows-eurozone-what-it-means-policy|publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research#VoxEU.org|Vox]]|date=April 2, 2012}}

Others, like some of the followers of the [[Modern Monetary Theory]] (MMT) school, have argued that a region with its own currency cannot have a Balance of Payments crisis because there exists a mechanism, the [[TARGET2]] system, that ensures that Eurozone member countries can always fund their current account deficits.&lt;ref name="MMT1"&gt;{{cite web|title=MMT AND THE EURO: Are Current Account Imbalances to Blame for the Euro Disaster?

'''Dividing territories''' (also '''market division''') is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several [[anti-competitive practices]] outlawed under [[United States antitrust law]]s. The term is generally understood to include dividing customers as well.

For example, in 1984, [[FMC Corp.]] and Asahi Chemical agreed to divide territories for the sale of [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and later FMC attempted to eliminate all vestiges of competition by inviting smaller rivals also to collude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/12/fmc.htm|title=FTC Order Settles Charges that FMC Corp. and Japan's Asahi Chemical Co.

[[File:Louisville, Kentucky skyline - April 2011.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Louisville skyline]]
'''Downtown Louisville''' is the largest [[central business district]] in the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]] and the urban hub of the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] Metropolitan Area.  Its boundaries are the [[Ohio River]] to the north, Hancock Street to the east, York and Jacob Streets to the south, and 9th Street to the west. As of 2015, the population of Downtown Louisville was 4,700, although this does not include directly surrounding areas such as Old Louisville, Butchertown, NuLu,and Phoenix Hill.

The five main areas of the [[Central Business District]] consist of:
*'''[[West Main District, Louisville|West Main District]]''' (west of 2nd St., north of Market St., east of 9th St., and south of the [[Ohio River]])
*'''East Main District''' (east of 2nd St., north of Market St., west of Hancock St., and south of the Ohio River; contains the [[Whiskey Row, Louisville|Whiskey Row Historic District]])
*'''Medical Center''' (east of 2nd St., south of Market St., west of Hancock St., and north of Jacob St.)
*'''Fourth St. District''' (south of Market St., west of 2nd St., north of York St., and east of 5th St.)
*'''Civic Center''' (south of Market St., west of 5th St., north of York St., and east of 9th St.)
The [[tallest buildings by states|tallest buildings]] in Kentucky are located in Downtown Louisville and include [[400 West Market]] designed by [[John Burgee]], [[National City Tower]] designed by [[Wallace Harrison|Harrison]] &amp; [[Max Abramovitz|Abramovitz]], [[PNC Plaza]] designed by [[Welton Becket]], and the [[Humana Building]] designed by [[Michael Graves]]. Of the 16 buildings in Kentucky over {{convert|300|ft|m}}, 12 are in Downtown Louisville. In addition, it is the center of local and regional government.

[[File:AEGON Center.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[400 West Market]]]]

A glassed-in [[skywalk]] called the Louie Link stretches six city blocks and links together the [[Kentucky International Convention Center]] (KICC), [[Fourth Street Live!]], three hotels ([[Galt House|Galt House Hotel &amp; Suites]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]] and [[Hyatt|Hyatt Regency]]), and 2,300 hotel rooms.  In 2010 it was extended from the [[Galt House]] to the new $16 million Skywalk Garage, an eight-level, 860-space parking facility on Third Street, and a second skywalk connects from the garage across Third Street to the new [[KFC Yum! Center]].

==History==
{{See also|History of Louisville, Kentucky}}
[[File:Levy building louisville.jpg|thumb|200px|The Richardsonian Romanesque Levy Building, built in 1893, is an example of Downtown Louisville's classic architecture, as well as its revitalization; the upper four floors have been converted to 23 loft condominiums.]]
Downtown Louisville is the oldest part of the city of Louisville, whose initial development was closely tied to the [[Ohio River]]. The largest early fort, [[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|Fort Nelson]], was built in 1781 near what is today the corner of 7th and Main streets. Many early residents lived nearby after moving out of the forts by the mid-1780s, although little remains of the earliest (mostly wood) structures.

Early plans of the city, such as William Pope's original plan in 1783, show a simple grid on an east/west axis along the river.  The earliest streets, Main, Market and Jefferson retain their original names from the plan, while the smaller Green Street is now known as Liberty (it was renamed after Green Street acquired a seedy reputation due to its many burlesque theaters).  Main Street was the city's initial commercial hub for nearly a century.

By 1830 Louisville passed [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] as Kentucky's largest city, with a population over 10,000.  The [[steamboat]] era saw the opening of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] just west of downtown, and local commerce picked up further with the founding of banks and manufacturing.  Most of Louisville's population was packed into downtown, which by this time stretched as far south as Prather Street (later renamed Broadway).  Many still-remaining buildings reveal what the area was like at this time, with narrow, two to four-story buildings packing the streets.

The area and the city continued to grow during the railroad era.  However, the increased mobility of early [[tram|trolleys]], as well as the sheer number and diversity of people moving to Louisville, saw a shift in focus as areas like [[Phoenix Hill]], [[Russell, Louisville|Russell]] and what is now [[Old Louisville]] began to be built on the edges of downtown, particularly after the city [[annexation|annexed]] those areas in 1868. Railroads lead to a diminished role for the river in transportation, further reducing the importance of downtown in favor of areas on what was then the edge of the city, along rail lines.

In 1886, the first skyscraper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aia-ckc.org/download.php?tn=mod_downloads_1&amp;pk=fileid&amp;id=138 |title=History of Louisville Architectural Firms |author=Wiser, Stephen A. |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072024/http://www.aia-ckc.org/download.php?tn=mod_downloads_1&amp;pk=fileid&amp;id=138 |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kenyon Building, was completed on Fifth Street, followed in 1890 by the ten-story [[Columbia Building (Louisville, Kentucky)|Columbia Building]]. The development of three large suburban parks and the electrified [[streetcar]] lead to the first true movement to the suburbs at this time.  Some of downtown's business and industry followed people toward these areas.  But by the 1920s the commercial center of Louisville was still nearby, at 4th and Broadway, dubbed the "magic corner" by the ''[[Louisville Herald-Post|Herald-Post]]''.  The riverfront area of downtown was still being actively improved, such as with the building of what is now [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] across the Ohio at Second Street in 1929.

After [[World War II]], suburbanization increased and downtown began to decline as interstate highways further reduced the importance of its central location.  Since the 1970s, downtown has been the subject of both [[urban renewal]] and [[historic preservation]] efforts. While many new buildings have been built, it has sometimes been at the expense of older landmarks, such as the [[Tyler Block]].

Many buildings sat totally or mostly vacant at this time, and some became dilapidated to the point where they burned down or had to be razed. Many riverfront industrial sites were abandoned or saw limited use, many were eventually redeveloped into [[Louisville Waterfront Park]]. Other issues in the 1970s through the early 1990s included a former theater district on Jefferson Street that had become dubbed the "porno district". The businesses there were seen by the city as an eyesore since they were so close to the convention center, and most were demolished or burned down by the late 1990s. A few adult book stores and bars remained in the general area as of 2007.

From the late 1970s to early 1990s, nine new high rises over {{convert|200|ft|m}} in height were built in downtown. Unlike the city's previous tallest buildings, which were all set along the Broadway corridor, these new buildings were set closer to the riverfront along Main and Market Streets.

Since 2000, downtown has seen another major growth spurt, although this one not only includes new high rises, but also a large scale return of large scale residential and retail back to the city center. The completion of [[Louisville Slugger Field]] along with a mass expansion of the city's
[[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]], both completed in 1998, sparked new development along the eastern edge of downtown, with entire abandoned blocks rebuilt with new condominium units and shops. Also, new to Louisville is the 22,000-seat [[KFC Yum! Center]] at Second and Main Streets which was completed in 2010.

==Residential==
[[File:Pendennis club c1906.jpg|thumb|Example of an early downtown mansion, this Walnut Street mansion was built by the Belknap family and used as the first clubhouse of the [[Pendennis Club]] before being razed]]
Early residences outside of the forts, still mostly wood structures, were built along the modern street grid on early lots sold to settlers, but have all been demolished over time. What became the almost entirely office and parking-lot dominated downtown still had many solidly single family residential blocks on its fringes up until the early 20th century. Streets near Broadway, such as Chestnut, were lined with large mansions of the owners of businesses on Main and Market streets.
[[File:Louemaindev.jpg|thumb|left|New development on East Main Street]]
Though these houses were built of brick and other longer-lasting materials, none remained single family homes by the 21st century, although some had been converted for other uses, such as office space. The [[Ronald-Brennan House|Brennan House]] at 631 S. Fifth, which is operated as a historic property with daily tours, shows a glimpse of Downtown Louisville's residential past. A structure at 432 South Fifth Street is the only example of a pre-Civil War residence remaining Downtown; built in 1829 it has been converted to commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;''Louisville Guide'' (2004), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 20th century, downtown Louisville had acquired a reputation as a place to work and visit during the week but which shuts down evenings and weekends. The first changes to this were the conversion of old warehouse and factory space to loft apartments in the late 1980s. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, new developments of luxury condominiums such as the 22-story ''Waterfront Park Place'', and the $30 million project ''Fleur de Lis on Main'', indicate increasing residential interest in Downtown Louisville. On September 9, 2013, Mayor Greg Fischer joined groundbreaking ceremonies for the second phase of ''RiverPark Place'',  a marina apartment/condominium development covering 40 acres along River Road,  with a walkway west to  [[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2013/OfficialsBreakGroundforExpandedRiverParkPlace.htm |title= Officials Break Ground for Expanded River Park Place – Louisville.gov |date= September 9, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130924222717/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2013/OfficialsBreakGroundforExpandedRiverParkPlace.htm |archivedate= September 24, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the [[Kentucky Towers]] was the largest residential building in Downtown Louisville,&lt;ref name="insiders"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nold|first1=Chip|last2=Bahr|first2=Bob|title=Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Kentucky &amp; Southern Indiana, 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LEOE3_1PUgwC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%22kentucky+towers%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kentucky%20towers%22&amp;f=false|year=1997|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1-57380-043-3|page=278|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015, just south of downtown, [[The 800 Apartments]] started undergoing a more than $10 million modernization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2015/06/19/800-apartments.html |title= Village Green CEO: 800 Apartments 'will be the best apartment building in Louisville' |work=Louisville Business First |date=June 19, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Downtown Louisville became Jefferson County's tenth [[Multiple Listing Service]] zone.
[[File:Loulibertygreens.jpg|thumb|right|Liberty Greens will contain over 600 [[mixed-income housing]] units]]
Housing units available downtown were expected to double between 2005 and 2010, from 1,800 to nearly 4,000, after increasing by only 900 units from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=October 1, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001202622/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/DowntownDevelopment/News/2006/DowntownActivity.htm |title=LouisvilleKy.gov - 2006 - Louisville's Downtown Alive with Development |publisher=louisvilleky.gov |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=December 6, 2011|url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/DowntownDevelopment/News/2006/DowntownActivity.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is both a result of new condominium construction and efforts to convert existing buildings into mixed usage, such as the $20 million redevelopment of the historic eight-story ''Henry Clay'' building at Third and Chestnut streets into a mix of residential, restaurant, retail and event space. The redevelopment also includes property that extends east to Fourth Street, which will become a public piazza, and the historic ''Wright-Taylor'' building, a two-story, {{convert|13500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} structure that faces Fourth Street and is located behind the Henry Clay, and is now an upscale restaurant that occupies the entire Wright-Taylor building.

==Plans==
Projects in the works include the construction of a wharf along the [[Riverwalk Trail]], and the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]], involving the reconstruction of [[Kennedy Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] (the intersection of [[Interstate 65|I-65]], [[Interstate 64|I-64]] and [[Interstate 71|I-71]]) along with the addition of a new bridge for northbound I-65 traffic. One recently completed project was the conversion of the former [[Big Four Bridge|Big Four railroad bridge]] into a pedestrian and bicycle only bridge, which opened on the Kentucky side in 2013 and the Indiana side in 2014.

On August 19, 2007, city leaders and the [[Cordish Company]], developers of [[4th Street Live!]], announced ''Center City'', a $442  million, multi-year plan to develop {{convert|23|acre|m2}}, bounded by Second, Third and Liberty streets and Muhammad Ali Boulevard, that will include new housing, restaurants, a cinema and a boutique hotel. An estimated {{convert|500000|sqft|m2}} of floor space being created, including a 15-story structure. As the plan would require $130 million in local and state tax rebates for Cordish, it requires approval from the [[Louisville Metro Council]] and [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. There is no official start time for the project, as financing is still being secured by the Cordish Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More in store for downtown |publisher=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=August 19, 2007 |author=Davis, Alex |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1724595761.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+19%2C+2007&amp;author=&amp;pub=Courier+-+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=More+in+store+for+downtown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also announced in 2007, the glass and steel $50 million shopping and office complex ''Iron Quarter'' was to be constructed within the [[Whiskey Row, Louisville|Whiskey Row Historic District]], but the project was delayed and eventually set aside when property owner Todd Blue made an agreement with the city of Louisville in January 2011 to demolish the seven original buildings.  In May 2011, after all seven buildings had been landmarked, a new agreement was made with the city to save five of the seven buildings by donating one and selling the other four, with the remaining two to be demolished.  Facades of all seven buildings are to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/Mayor/News/2011/5-9-11+whsikey+row+saved.htm |title=Fischer Announces Plans to Preserve Historic Whiskey Row |publisher=LouisvilleKY.gov |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1943), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; ) was an American accountant, and the first Professor of Accounting at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School of Finance and Commerce]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="AM 1976"&gt;[[Matz, Adolph]]. "[http://www.accountingin.com/accounting-historians-journal/volume-3-numbers-1-4/edward-p-moxey-jr/ Edward P. Moxey, Jr.]" ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' (1976): 63-68.

== Biography ==
Born in Philadelphia to Edward P. and Mary Ann, Moxey was named after his father. He was banker, broker, businessman and accountant, had founded the Edward P. Moxey accountancy firm, and had published the 1881 book, entitled "Fluctuations of the New York stock market, 1870-1880." Moxey obtained his BS in Economics in 1904, his MA in 1906, and his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1909. Subsequently, he obtained his Certified Public Accountants license in 1913 for the state of Pennsylvania.
[[File:Edward P. Moxey &amp; Co, 1912.jpg|thumb|133px|Business ad, 1912]]
After his graduation Moxey joined the accountancy firm Edward P. Moxey &amp; Co, where he became partner in 1911. After his father's death in 1915, he took over the prestigious accounting firm.&lt;ref name="SAS 1982"&gt;Steven A. Sass (1982). ''The pragmatic imagination: a history of the Wharton School, 1881-1981.'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The firm would eventually merge into [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Coopers &amp; Lybrand. ''Journal, Volume 43,'' 1962. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Moxey had started at the University of Pennsylvania as Assistant Instructor in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;Cornell March Dowlin. ''The University of Pennsylvania today: its buildings, departments &amp; work.'' University of Pennsylvania press, 1940. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; became Instructor in 1907, Assistant Professor in 1910 and Full Professor in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business (1940) ''Faculty Personnel.'' Vol. 5. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School of Finance and Commerce]] he was the first to be appointed Professor of Accounting, and the first chairman of its Accounting department.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Thomas Devine, Harvey S. Hendrickson (1999). ''Carl Thomas Devine: Essays in Accounting Theory : a Capstone.'' p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Moxey was co-founder of the [[National Association of Cost Accountants]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Chatfield]], [[Richard Vangermeersch]] (eds.) ''[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/416 The History of Accounting (RLE Accounting): An International Encyclopedia]'' 2014. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; board member and co-founder of its Philadelphia chapter and its president in 1929-31.&lt;ref name="AM 1976"/&gt;

Moxey's son, Edward P. Moxey, III, graduated from Wharton in 1930 and followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps and became a third generation CPA. He worked for Philco-Ford Corporation, later [[Ford Aerospace]], and taught at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="AM 1976"/&gt;

== Work ==
=== Accounting at the Wharton School ===
Moxey had joined the Wharton School faculty in the early 1900s. A 1904 article in the ''Bulletin'' of the American Institute of Banking reports, that under Moxey, Jr., a class in bookkeeping was organized for those without previous experience. The class completed the first set of books in the elementary work, and at the beginning of the second half would take up first year accounting, to be prepared to take advanced accounting in the second year.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Banking. ''Bulletin,'' Vol. 4. American Institute of Banking., 1904. p. 1096.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching in accounting had been organized within the Wharton School since its initiation. [[Joseph Wharton]] had agreed upon this in its initial plan, which had stated that "one professor or instructor of accounting or bookkeeping [should] teach the simplest and most practical forms of bookkeeping for housekeepers, for private individuals, for commercial and banking firms, for manufacturing establishments, and for banks; also, the modes of keeping accounts by executors, trustees, and assignees, by the officials of towns and cities, as well as by the several departments of a State or National Government; also, the routine of business between a bank and a customer."&lt;ref name="AM 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: "[https://archive.org/stream/educationofbusin00jamerich#page/30/mode/2up Plan of the  Wharton School]," in: ''Education of Business Men.'' (1891) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second year at the Wharton School (1905–06) Moxey taught three regular accounting courses, entitled "Elementary Accounting," "Accounting Systems," and "C.P.A. Problems."&lt;ref name="AM 1976"/&gt;

=== ''Accounting Systems'' (1911) === 
[[File:Accounting systems, 1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1911]]
In 1911 Moxey's first book ''Accounting Systems'' was published by the [[Alexander Hamilton Institute]]. This work was part of a twelve-volume series on ''Modem Business,'' and was written for a particular clientele. The series is designed for home study, partly as the basis for correspondence work, but more generally used as a comprehensive treatment of business organization and methods for persons studying by themselves without personal intercourse with an instructor.&lt;ref name="HRH 1912"&gt;[[Henry Rand Hatfield]]. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821079 Reviewed Works: Accounting Systems by Edward P. Moxey, Jr.; Auditing and Cost Accounts: Part I: Auditing by Seymour Walton; Auditing and Cost Accounts: Part II: Cost Accounts by Stephen W. Gilman]." in: ''Journal of Political Economy,'' Vol. 20, No. 8 (Oct., 1912), pp. 858-861&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1912 review by [[Henry Rand Hatfield]] in ''Journal of Political Economy,'' Hatfield explained, that "for such it would seem an almost indispensable feature that there be furnished a convenient, yet fairly comprehensive, list of collateral references. Even in the college classroom, where text can readily be amplified by suggestions or criticisms of the instructor, the use of collateral references is well-nigh universal. Much more important is it that the isolated student should be encouraged to compare other, perhaps conflicting, views. Furthermore, the interested student constantly desires to
branch out and make a more intensive study of some topic, touched upon in a general treatise but in such a work necessarily given but scant attention."&lt;ref name="HRH 1912"/&gt;

In the 1912 review Hatfield further explained, that the subject matter of the volumes is in general very well presented. Moxey, in the volume on accounting systems, presents in some considerable detail general systems of accounts adapted respectively to the needs of building and loan associations, life and fire insurance companies, department stores, gas companies, railroads, street railways, and municipalities. To these are added chapters on bank
accounting by Howard Jefferson, on brewery accounting by Otto A. Grundmann, and on accounts of executors and administrators by Harold D. Greeley. Hatfield commented, that "if any criticism is to be made it might be that somewhat too much attention is given to details of forms, and too little emphasis is laid on the particular features which logically require differently ordered accounting systems."&lt;ref name="HRH 1912"/&gt;

And furthermore Hatfield (1912) noted, that "it seems almost gratuitous to print forms of a customer's check, a bank draft, and a deposit ticket. The purchase of supplies is not particularly different in a department store from that in a gas company, or a street railway, so there is some repetition in describing the handling of purchases in each of these institutions. Voucher payments and pay-rolls are not referred to in the discussion of department stores, but are described in connection with gas companies as if particularly connected with the latter industry. The chapter on municipal accounts is the least satisfactory; that on department stores is particularly clear and interesting."&lt;ref name="HRH 1912"/&gt;

=== ''Principles of Factory Cost Keeping'' (1913) ===
[[File:Principles of factory cost keeping, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1913]]
In the preface of the 1913 "Principles of Factory Cost Keeping," Moxey started to explain, that the literature in which an activity finds its expression depends upon the interest in, and the development of, that activity. It was according to Moxey therefore not surprising to find that there was comparatively little literature on accounting in his days.&lt;ref name="M 1913 iii-iv"&gt;Moxey 1913 p. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Waldo Haskins]] had said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The literature of accounting is virtually in its infancy, awaiting the fostering care of cultured authorship."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haskins' statement was particularly applicable to the subject of cost accounting. Although many valuable articles had been written on different phases of this subject, and while excellent books on costs had appeared from time to time, it was a notable fact that such articles and such books have been either of a highly technical character, or otherwise treating of special systems of costs as actually installed and used by certain manufacturing plants.&lt;ref name="M 1913 iii-iv"/&gt;

As a result of this, according to Moxey, in his day there existed in many minds the idea that the principles of cost accounting were more or less mysterious and vague, and that the subject is one for the expert, only to be understood after years of study and experience. This idea is due largely to the lack of a clear and simple presentation of the principles upon which cost accounting rests; and it is to supply this need that the present book has been prepared.&lt;ref name="M 1913 iii-iv"/&gt;

Moxey admitted that the use of diagrams in illustrating the principles of cost accounting is not new. They were used quite successfully in the early 1880s by [[Emile Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells]] in their book "Factory Accounts"; but the idea had been further developed by Moxey, and had been made applicable to conditions of his day.&lt;ref name="M 1913 iii-iv"/&gt;

Moxey ended his preface by stating that "the book offered to those interested along cost accounting lines, with the hope that it may help to a clearer understanding of the true aims of this important branch of accounting science."&lt;ref name="M 1913 iii-iv"/&gt;

=== The purpose of cost keeping ===
Moxey (1913) explained that there are two reasons which warrant the keeping of cost records and which justify the consequent expense involved.&lt;ref&gt;Moxey (1913, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; 
:1)  Cost keeping furnishes the manufacturer with accurate and reliable information concerning the costs incurred in production, enabling him to fix prices and bid intelligently against others in the same field. 
:2)  Through his cost accounting department the manufacturer is enabled to detect, locate, and eliminate waste or leakage in materials, labor, and other expenses incident to production.

=== Analysis of General Ledger ===
A system of accounting, according to Moxey, should go beyond the elementary presentation of facts to furnish information sufficient and accurate enough for the requirements of modern business. Some classes of expense are not of a temporary nature. The use of certain articles in production such as machinery extends over a series of years. It is not right to charge the original cost of such purchases to profit and loss in the period in which they are made, for they will figure in the manufacture of hundreds of subsequent lots of goods. 
In his ''Principles of Factory Cost Keeping'' (1913) Moxey proposes a system, which is based on the following basic distinctions:&lt;ref name="M 1913 9-11"&gt;Moxey 1913 p. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1 Analysis of General Ledger, 1919.jpg|thumb|480px|Analysis of General Ledger, 1919]]
* ''Temporary and Permanent Expenditures'' : For cost accounting purposes, therefore, a first distinction considering expenditures only for the present must be made between expenditures for assets of a more permanent type generally known as fixed assets, and comprehended in the term "Plant" and those of a more or less temporary character, known as "Profit and Loss" items, or those comprehended in the general class of "Nominal Accounts."&lt;ref name="M 1913 9-11"/&gt; 
* ''Classification of Merchandising Expenditures'' : Following this a more detailed classification becomes desirable. Taking a merchandising concern for the sake of illustration, we find that "Profit and Loss" expenditure is divided into two parts, the distinguishing feature being the difference between payments for that which is dealt in, classified under the heading "Merchandise," and payments for services and other items necessary to the proper conduct of the business, known as "General Expense."&lt;ref name="M 1913 9-11"/&gt;

A further subdivision of "General Expense" must then be made to show the items which make up its total amount. Two subheadings, known respectively as "Trading Expense" and "Administrative Expense," are usually employed. The former covers the detailed expense accounts which go to make up the cost of distributing the goods, including salesmen's salaries and expenses, rent of the store in the case of a merchandising house, costs of advertising and of the delivery service; while the latter includes those accounts which show the cost of managing the financial and business affairs of the concern, including all administrative salaries and general office expense, such as, for example, office supplies.&lt;ref name="M 1913 9-11"/&gt;

On the other hand, "Merchandise," being entirely too general in its character, is also subdivided. The first distinction is that made between purchases and sales. The sales may also be divided into classified sales accounts, while in the division of the purchases we find the first signs of detailed costs.&lt;ref name="M 1913 9-11"/&gt;

=== Relation Between Cost and General Books ===
In factory accounting more cost books are being used corresponding to the different divisions of the factory: There are the "Stores Ledger," the "Cost Ledger," and the "Stock Ledger." The relation of these cost books to the general commercial books is shown by the diagram.&lt;ref name="M 1913 14-17"&gt;Moxey 1913 p. 14-17&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:2 Relation of Cost Books to Commercial Books, 1919.jpg|thumb|480px|Relation of Cost Books to Commercial Books, 1919]]

In order to understand the diagram and illustrate the operation of the books, it can be presumed that a certain sum of money is disbursed for the purchase of materials, labor, and other supplies and services connected with the production of the goods. This, in the ordinary journal form, would be represented by an entry, whereby materials, labor, and/or indirect expense are directed to cash. By this entry the accounts costing the business value are debited, and the account which has produced value, viz., cash, is credited.&lt;ref name="M 1913 14-17"/&gt;

Now Moxey explained, that in his days in a small business this method of accomplishing the result might be satisfactory. In a large business, however, there are numerous transactions involving these accounts which occur every business day. If these were to be separately recorded in the 
journal, the work required and the expense involved would be out of all proportion to the results obtained. To avoid this labor, transactions 
of a similar nature, when there are many of them, are brought together in one subsidiary record, and the totals only are posted to the ledger. Thus there is usually a book devoted to the detailed recording of cash receipts and payments, while the general ledger cash account is concerned 
merely with the totals. Likewise the "Stores Ledger" contains a number of accounts usually kept upon cards for convenience in handling, or 
else in loose-leaf books whose totals appear in a general ledger "Stores" account.  If, then, a certain amount of money should be paid out for the purchase of stores, the cash book entry expressing such transaction.&lt;ref name="M 1913 14-17"/&gt;

Both the stores item and the cash item find their way to the general ledger in totals. The stores item also appears in the stores ledger in 
detail, being taken from the original purchase invoices. When the stores purchased, after having been received and placed in the storeroom, 
are requisitioned and delivered to the producing departments, there must be a credit to the Stores account for the value of the quantity delivered, etc.&lt;ref name="M 1913 14-17"/&gt;

=== Progress of factory work as appears in the books ===
[[File:3 Operations of a Factory System, 1919.jpg|thumb|Operations of factory System, 1919]]
A special feature of the ''Principles of Factory Cost Keeping'' (1913) was an illustration and description of the progress of factory work as it appears in the books. It is illustrated in the accompanying diagram, which shows the operation of a factory cost system from the time payment of cash is made to begin production until the goods have been completed and are available for sale. At the bottom of the diagram Moxey noted, that the difference between the total Merchandise Orders appearing and the Debit side of the Trading Account and the Sales Invoices represents 
gross manufacturing profit.&lt;ref name="M 1913 19-21"&gt;Moxey 1913 p. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Moxey further explained that the manufacturer, who has his factory cost system arranged on this general plan is in a position enabling him to adjust his selling prices so as to bring to him the largest amount of profit. He possesses a cost system organized along the same lines as his system of factory management; a system economical of operation, accurate in its results as to current operations, and one from which estimates or bids on future work can be accurately and quickly made. By a subdivision of his sales account into the different classes or grades of goods 
manufactured, and by carrying corresponding cost accounts, he can accurately determine the cost of producing each line of goods and the profit or loss on each grade sold.&lt;ref name="M 1913 19-21"/&gt;

And furthermore Moxey explained, that "the factors which enter into the manufacturing cost of any product can be grouped under the main headings of "Stores," "Direct Labor," and "Indirect Expenses." We are now in a position to take up each of these in the order given, and to show the method of determining the amount and value of each. At the same time, we shall see how to detect and prevent waste and leaks, which are important items to the manufacturer from the standpoint of profits. etc."&lt;ref name="M 1913 19-21"/&gt;

=== Accounting for Labour, Methods of Recording Time ===
The third chapter of the ''Principles of Factory Cost Keeping,'' is dedicated to "Accounting for Labour."  The chief problem in the accounting for labor, according to Moxey, is the formulation of a system which will give an accurate record of the labor time consumed in production. Hereto different methods of recording time have been developed. Initially there were two systems.&lt;ref name="M 1913 44-49"&gt;Moxey 1913 p. 44-49&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The methods of recording time that had started in many factories relied on a ''watchman'' or ''gatekeeper'', stationed at the entrance to the factory, kept a record of the employees as they arrived in the morning and departed at night, each workman being known to him personally. Under this system, if an employee were late, even if only as much as a minute, he was docked a half hour's time. Any labor cost less than half an hour did not figure in production costs. The gatekeeper's record was amply sufficient for [[payroll]] purposes, as well as for the determination of costs of production in the aggregate. 
* Under another system of timekeeping each laborer was assigned a number. A series of brass checks, numbered to correspond to the workmen's numbers, were hung on a board at the gatekeeper's lodge or outside the watchman's office, and as the men entered in the morning each one would take his own check off its hook and drop it into a box kept for that purpose at the watchman's office. The board on which the checks were hung, being arranged on a pivot, was turned around when the beginning whistle blew so that the side containing the checks faced into the office. Any man who was late must then pass through the watchman's office before he would receive credit for having been at the plant. This scheme worked well as long as the watchman was careful not to let any man drop the check of a comrade at the time that he dropped his own. 
The weakness of both these systems lay in the fact that there was no check whatever on the time the men actually spent at work. A man might 
register for an absent comrade, or he might record his own arrival and then take his departure from the plant by climbing over the back fence, returning by the same route at noon in order to pass out through the gate. By this means he would receive credit for having worked a full half day, when as a matter of fact he had rendered no service whatever to his employer.&lt;ref name="M 1913 44-49"/&gt;

[[File:7 Relation between Time Cards, and Work Tickets, 1919.jpg|thumb|Relation between Time Cards, and Work Tickets, 1919]]
In order to prevent such practices it was found necessary to employ departmental timekeepers, whose duty it was to make a tour of the plant to ascertain whether each man was at his appointed task. It was soon recognized that a knowledge of the exact time spent by each man on a piece of work handled by him was not only desirable but necessary, in order to determine accurately the [[labor cost]] of each unit of product. This was accomplished by the timekeeper getting from each workman a statement of the time spent on different pieces of work; and the results of these rough guesses were used to compile the labor cost of work in process. The employment of departmental timekeepers was an added expense to the operation of the plant.&lt;ref name="M 1913 44-49"/&gt;

The next development was to have the men themselves keep their record of time spent on each piece of work. The results were set forth on slips which were turned into the office, where the time as shown was posted to the accounts of the various orders to which it belonged. This, as can well be seen, was a loose system, for the reason that the workman's sense of time was frequently not well developed, and there was neither incentive nor necessity for accuracy. Since there was no definite check on the workman's movements, his record would often show that he "knocked off" at 12:30 P.M., when as a matter of fact he quit work at 12:20 P.M., and loitered around the toilet room or engaged in conversation with other workmen for the extra ten minutes which had been charged by him to the work just finished.&lt;ref name="M 1913 44-49"/&gt;

These difficulties have been largely overcome by the use of mechanical devices for the recording of time. One record is made of the total time on duty, which serves as the basis for the pay-roll, and a second record is kept of the time actually expended on work performed, which serves as the basis of the charges to manufacturing cost. The time on duty is obtained from a time card record, while the time on work in process appears on work tickets or job cards. The total time on duty should agree with, the total time expended on goods in process, plus any lost time. Expressed diagrammatically the relation of the time cards to the work tickets is shown in the diagram. The data from the time cards were transferred into the [[time book]], and this data would eventually end up in the [[general ledger]].&lt;ref name="M 1913 44-49"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The US Federal Board for Vocational Education (1919) had described Moxey's "Principles of Factory Cost Keeping" (1919) as a "clear, simple treatment of the fundamental principles of cost accounting."&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Board for Vocational Education. ''Monograph. Rehabilitation Joint Series ...,'' Nr. 34-67. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1919. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAS 1982"/&gt; In those days the field of cost accounting was largely controlled by [[scientific management]] consultants and managers, but Moxey was able to establish a firm national reputation as leader in the area.&lt;ref name="SAS 1982"/&gt; Understandably, in 1924 William Duncan Gordon and Jeremiah Lockwood dedicated their ''Modern Accounting Systems'' to Edward P. Moxey, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;William Duncan Gordon, and Jeremiah Lockwood ''[https://archive.org/stream/modernaccounting029859mbp#page/n5/mode/2up Modern Accounting Systems],'' fifth ed. 1946. p. iv&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1972 article, [[Adolph Matz]] summarized that Moxey's elementary work on [[cost accounting]] was taught at the University, and in Evening School, and was part of the State’s C.P.A. examination. His work was taught over four decades, but after World War II the "new trends in teaching accounting and the move away from the practical approach led in the early 1950s to the discontinuation of the course."&lt;ref name="AM 1976"/&gt;

Moxey is nowadays also credited for advocating the practice of including imputed interest on the total capital invested (which didn't work out), and for advocating [[Variance (accounting)|variance accounts]]. According to [[Esbjörn Segelod|Segelod]] &amp; Carlsson (2010), Moxey "offered a means to connect cost accounting and financial accounting even in times of price changes. Variance analysis became common in the United States in the early 1920s following the rapid development of standard costing between 1910 and 1920..., while the technique of connecting cost and financial accounting was... well elaborated in Anglo-Saxon countries around 1920."&lt;ref&gt;[[Segelod, Esbjörn]], and Leif Carlsson. "[http://perpus.upstegal.ac.id/v4/files/e_book/57138300.pdf The emergence of uniform principles of cost accounting in Sweden 1900–36] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209183412/http://perpus.upstegal.ac.id/v4/files/e_book/57138300.pdf |date=2015-02-09 }}." Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History 20.3 (2010): 327-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more, according to [[Esbjörn Segelod|Segelod]] &amp; Carlsson (2011), the "[[scientific management]] and the introduction of variance accounts, developed by Moxey (1913), paved the way for the rapid development of [[standard costing]] in the US between 1910 and 1920."&lt;ref&gt;[[Segelod, Esbjörn]], and Leif Carlsson. "[http://perpus.upstegal.ac.id/v4/files/e_book/57138300.pdf Is Swedish Cost Accounting Practice Really an Imitation of the German?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209183412/http://perpus.upstegal.ac.id/v4/files/e_book/57138300.pdf |date=2015-02-09 }}."

'''Electronic City''' is an [[information technology]] hub in [[Bangalore]], India, located in [[Anekal]] taluk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.electronic-city.in/about/introduction|title=About Electronic City|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of India's largest electronic/IT [[industrial park]]s, spread over 800 acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km²) in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages in Bangalore. It consists of four zones called ''phases''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV. Electronic City was established by Keonics, Karnataka Electronic,&lt;ref name="keonics"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.keonics.in/
|title= Keonics web site
|publisher=Keonics
|accessdate=2011-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in information technology infrastructure development. There are approximately 200 [[Information technology|IT]]/[[Business process outsourcing|ITES]] companies located in Electronic City, which include main campuses of
IT/Bio-tech majors [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]], [[HCL Technologies|HCL]], [[Tech Mahindra]], [[Biocon]] etc.

==History==
Electronic City was the brainchild of [[R. K. Baliga]], the first Chairman and Managing Director of Keonics, Karnataka Electronic.&lt;ref name="keonics" /&gt; He dreamt of making Bangalore the [[Silicon Valley of India]] when he developed the concept of Electronic City. In 1978, Keonics established Electronic City on 332 acres of land in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages. The [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalisation of the Indian economy]] in the early 1990s by the then Indian Prime Minister [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] and then Indian Finance Minister [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]] helped Electronic City to become what it is today&amp;nbsp;— the outsourcing capital of the world.

In 1997, the maintenance and upkeep of Electronic City was handed over by Keonics to ELCIA, the Electronic City Industries Association, with  representatives from units in the enclave, for effective local governance and management. Security is provided by ELCIA, who have deployed around 500 security officials and also installed CCTV cameras on strategic locations. On 18 March 2013, a notification by the Urban Development Department has brought Electronic City Phases I, II, III under the E-City Industrial Township Area.

==Connectivity==
Electronic City has well developed infrastructure in terms of connectivity to other important localities of Bangalore City.
==Road==
====Hosur Road====
Electronic City is on Hosur road which is a major arterial highway of [[Bengaluru]] city. Many [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation|BMTC]] buses and interstate buses ply

====Elevated Expressway====

A mold is a hollow shape which exactly encloses the shape of a desired object. The object is usually created by pouring a liquid into the mold and allowing it to solidify: typical liquids include molten metal or plastic, [[plaster of Paris]], epoxy resin.

Molds generally divide into two classes: solid or flexible.

There are five different types of flexible mold compounds in significant use today.

==Hot-Melt==
[[polyvinyl chloride]]

* inexpensive, worn molds can be melted and recast.
* hazardous to handle due to high temperatures required for melting.
* use limited to model and pattern materials that are heat resistant.

==Latex==
* produces a very elastic, thin-walled, strong mold
* shrinkage is high
* molds must be supported to prevent distortion.
* 10 to 20 brush coats must be applied for adequate thickness, with time allowed to "dry" in between each coat, making the mold is slow and time consuming.

==Silicone rubbers==
* excellent molds for casting resins and foams
* material cost is extremely high.

==Polysulfide rubbers==
* versatile and are especially useful for casting plaster, Hydrocal, and other water mixed cements.
* can be used for casting wax candles and some limited use for [[resin casting]].
* easy to handle, non-adhesive and can be poured over clay or practically any type of model or pattern, using very simple release agents such as soap or [[Vaseline]].
* can be used to take impressions directly from a waterclay or plastelene model, so that permanent master models can then be cast in plaster or Hydrocal.

==Polyurethane flexible mold compounds==
* limited shelf stability
* "moisture conscious"
* easy to handle with simple mixing ratios and good fluidity.
* can be used for pouring practically any type of cementitious material, casting resin or foam formulation.
* Cost of material is far below that of the silicones and appreciably lower than polysulfides.

From the standpoint of general utility and economy, the polyurethanes surpass all other types{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.

==Equipment and accessories==
Mixing containers and stirring paddles should be of metal or plastic and always spotlessly clean, warm and dry. Use 1-inch fiber brushes cut down to 1-inch length for application of wax release agent. A regular short fiber scrubbing brush should be used for buffing wax from deep grain or fine design of model or pattern.

Sulphur Free Plastalina Clay (The Compleat Sculptor, New York City) is excellent for modeling, laying up and sealing models and dams. 1/4"-3/8" plywood should be used for mounting models. Scrap pieces can be sawed to rectangular shapes and used for straight side retaining dams.

Lightweight sheet metal, linoleum and heavy cardboard can be used for circular or irregular shaped retaining walls. Sash cord and masking tape are used to bind the walls to the model baseboard. 1/2" X 2" furring and "2 x 4's" cut to short lengths make good wedges. For plaster casting, use regular Molding or Casting Plaster

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Genchi Genbutsu'''''|現地現物}} means "Go and See” and it is a key principle of the [[Toyota Production System]]. It suggests that in order to truly understand a situation one needs to go to ''[[genba]]'' (現場) or, the "real place" - where work is done.

==Application==
[[Taiichi Ohno]], creator of the Toyota Production System is credited, perhaps apocryphally, with taking new graduates to the shopfloor and drawing a chalk circle on the floor. The graduate would be told to stand in the circle, observe and note what he saw. When Ohno returned he would check; if the graduate had not seen enough he would be asked to keep observing. Ohno was trying to imprint upon his future engineers that the only way to truly understand what happens on the shop floor was to go there. It was where value was added and waste could be observed. 

Genchi Genbutsu is therefore a key approach in problem solving. If the problem exists on the shop floor then it needs to be understood and solved at the shop floor. 

Genchi Genbutsu is also called [[Gemba]] attitude. Gemba is the Japanese term for "the place" in this case "the place where it actually happens". Since real value is created at the shop floor in manufacturing, this is where managers need to spend their time.

Genchi Genbutsu is sometimes referred to as "Getcha boots on" (and go out and see what is happening) due to its similar cadence and meaning. It has been compared to [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman Jr|Waterman's]] idea of "[[Management By Wandering Around]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmhut.com/management-by-wandering-around-mbwa | title = Management by Wandering Around | author= Noel W. Hinners |date = October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept quickly became so universal that new managers instinctively knew that they had to "walk around" to achieve high effectiveness levels. Whilst these ideas, with their associated lists of how-tos, are probably good ideas they may miss the essential nature of Genchi Genbutsu which is less to "visit" and more to "know" by being there. Toyota has high levels of management presence on the production line whose role is to "know" and to constantly improve.

== Implementation ==

"Gemba attitude" reflects the idea that whatever reports, measures and ideas are transmitted to management are only an abstraction of what is actually going on in the ''genba'' to create value. Metrics and reports will reflect the attitudes of the management questioner and the workplace responder as well as how the responder views the questioner. It also increases the chance that actual issues and unplanned events will be observed first hand and can be managed immediately; this includes issues that are not apparent to the ''genba'' workforce.

Count '''Gustaf Archibald Siegwart Douglas''' (born 3 March 1938) is a Swedish [[aristocrat]], billionaire businessman, and politician. He has been a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] since 2007.&lt;ref name="iva"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gustaf Archibald Siegwart Douglas (born 3 March 1938) is the oldest son of Count Carl Ludvig Douglas (26 July 1908 [[Stjärnorp Castle|Stjärnorp]] - 21 January 1961 [[Rio de Janeiro]]), a Swedish nobleman and diplomat who was Royal Swedish Ambassador to Brazil, and his [[Prussia]]n wife Ottora Maria Haas-Heye (13 February 1910 [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen|Partenkirchen]] - 17 July 2001).

===Career===
After an [[M.B.A.]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1964, he worked in Sweden and was [[CEO]] of the newspapers [[Dagens Nyheter]] and [[Expressen]] between 1973 and 1980. After that he founded his company [[Investment AB Latour]] in 1984, through which he now controls security firm [[Securitas AB]], the world-leading lock producer [[Assa Abloy]] and more. He forms a partnership with fellow businessman [[Melker Schörling]], who also controls a significant amount of Securitas shares and serves as the company's chairman. He is the eleventh [[List of Swedes by net worth|wealthiest person in Sweden]], according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, with an estimated [[net worth]] of around [[United States dollar|US$]]3.2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] as of March 2013.
 
In 2001 Douglas was elected to the board of the [[Moderate Party]]. He has a long history of political involvement, having campaigned in his teens for what was the predecessor of the Moderates. Douglas was, however, for a time active within the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]]. Now he is known as a rather [[Conservatism|Conservative]] Moderate with a big interest in [[education policy]].

==Personal life, family==
His [[patriline]] is Scottish, of the [http://gw0.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=brynjulf&amp;lang=fr&amp;m=N&amp;v=Douglas Swedish-German branch], descended via two obscure generations,&lt;ref&gt;The descent is unquestionably legitimate from one [http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=17897 Patrick Douglas], of Standingstone, who married Cairistiona Leslie, and whose son Robert Douglas (1611-1662) emigrated to Sweden and became the first Swedish count Douglas&lt;/ref&gt; from the youngest son of [[James Douglas, 1st Lord Dalkeith]], ancestor of the 15th century [[Earl of Morton|Earls of Morton]]. All these Douglases were of the Morton branch of the ancient [[Clan Douglas|Douglas]] family.

The Douglas family was introduced in the 17th century at [[Swedish House of Nobility|Riddarhuset]] under number 19 among families of [[count|comital]] status. Gustaf Douglas has later served on the board of Riddarhuset.

His maternal great-grandfather was [[Philip, Prince of Eulenburg]] and [[Hertefeld]] (1847–1921), a friend of [[Wilhelm II]], whose youngest child Viktoria Ada Astrid Agnes Gräfin zu Eulenburg (1886–1967) married 1909 (div. 1921) professor Otto Ludwig Haas-Heye (1879–1959), and had issue, including two daughters. Gustaf descends through both his mother and father from medieval Scandinavian nobility and rulers.

He is married to Elisabeth, ''née'' [[Essen family|von Essen]], of another noble family. Gustaf and Elisabeth Douglas have two children, Carl and Eric. Both serve at different positions within the family group of companies. The Douglas family live at [[Rydboholm Castle]] outside [[Åkersberga]]. One of his younger sisters is [[Rosita Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]] third (and former) wife of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough]]. Gustaf’s other sister, [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria]] is married to [[Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria]].

==Philately==
[[File:Gul tre skilling banco.jpg|thumb|The [[Treskilling Yellow]] stamp]]
In May 2013, Douglas acquired the only known example of the 1855 [[Treskilling Yellow]] postage stamp, one of the rarest in the world, in a private sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Julia |title=Treskilling Yellow is back in the hands of a philatelist |publisher=Stamp Magazine |date=2013-11-01 |url=http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/news/article/treskilling-yellow-is-back-in-the-hands-of-a-philatelist/17013 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KvVwRib9?url=http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/news/article/treskilling-yellow-is-back-in-the-hands-of-a-philatelist/17013 |archivedate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gérard Lhéritier''' (born 21 June 1948) is a French [[manuscript]] dealer and expert in [[balloon mail]]. He is (or was) a sponsor of the [[National Library of France]] and around 2004 was the buyer of the manuscript of the [[Marquis de Sade]]’s ''[[120 Days of Sodom]]''. In 1990 he founded Aristophil but in March 2015, was arrested by French police in connection with an investigation into a suspected [[pyramid scheme]] fraud at the firm. In 2012, he won the largest ever EuroMillions jackpot awarded in France at €170 million.

==Early life==
Lhéritier was born on 21 June 1948, in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France, the son of a plumber from [[Lorraine]].&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/06/frances-king-of-manuscripts-held-over-suspected-pyramid-scheme |title=France's 'king of manuscripts' held over suspected pyramid scheme fraud &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]], in [[Void-Vacon]], and lived in [[Strasbourg]] until 1984 before moving to [[Nice]].&lt;ref name="Aconseil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boudet|first1=Guy|title=Gérard Lhéritier, le chevalier des lettres|url=http://aconseil.net/gerard-lheritier-le-chevalier-des-lettres/|website=Aconseil|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[Image:Ballonbrief.jpg|thumb|300px|The address side of a balloon post card from the 1870 siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War.]]
[[File:Paris 2014 lettres et manuscrits 01.jpg|thumb|The former Musée des Lettres et Manuscrits.]]
Lhéritier served in the French army after which he was an asset manager.&lt;ref name="RepublicainLorrain"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fedrigo|first1=Thierry|title=L’intime de Verlaine Hugo, Berlioz et des autres|url=http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2011/06/05/l-intime-de-verlaine-hugo-berlioz-et-des-autres|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=Le Republicain Lorrain|date=5 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222314/http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2011/06/05/l-intime-de-verlaine-hugo-berlioz-et-des-autres|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s he discovered by chance in a stamp shop in Paris a letter marked "''par ballon monté''" while seeking a rare stamp for his son. This caused him to research balloon mail and write several books on the subject, including a novel, ''Les Ballons de la liberté'' (1995).&lt;ref name="RepublicainLorrain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Babelio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gérard Lhéritier|url=http://www.babelio.com/auteur/Gerard-Lheritier/140202|website=Babelio|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is (or was) a sponsor of the National Library of France.

==Aristophil==
In 1990, Lhéritier founded the company [[Aristophil]] in Nice, to buy historical manuscripts, letters and other documents, and then to sell shares in those items to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.artmarketmonitor.com/2014/11/19/in-france-fears-that-rare-book-and-manuscript-fund-is-a-e500m-fraud/ |title=In France, Fears that Rare Book and Manuscript Fund is a €500m Fraud |website=Artmarketmonitor.com |date=19 November 2014 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Lhéritier purchased 54 pages of correspondence between [[Albert Einstein]] and the Swiss mathematician [[Michele Besso]] for $559,500 at Christie’s New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20160422184716/http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/French-police-widen-net-in-manuscripts-investigation/37349 French police widen net in manuscripts investigation.] Vincent Noce, ''The Art Newspaper'', 17 March 2015. Retrieved 22 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He divided these into 400 shares, which he sold to investors. His company, Aristophil, retained the right to buy back the shares at an higher price but did not commit itself to doing so.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

He was the buyer, in about 2004, of the manuscript of the Marquis de Sade’s ''120 Days of Sodom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Manuscript-dealer-suspected-of-running-Ponzi-pyramid/36624 |title=Gérard Lhéritier, founder of Aristophil, fights to clear name after police raid|accessdate=17 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303045220/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Manuscript-dealer-suspected-of-running-Ponzi-pyramid/36624 |archivedate=3 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Willsher|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/marquis-de-sade-scroll-120-days-sodom-paris |title=Original Marquis de Sade scroll returns to Paris |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Lhéritier established the [[Musée des Lettres et Manuscrits]] at 8 Rue de Nesle in Paris, and it moved to 222 [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in 2010. It closed in 2015/16, and its contents have been impounded by the French authorities.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In March 2015, Lhéritier was held in police custody in Paris, and released after posting bail of €2 million. He is under formal investigation for a suspected pyramid scheme fraud.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to his lawyer, Francis Triboulet, nobody can claim with certainty to have lost money, because the manuscripts had not yet been sold, and their actual value is thus still unknown. The dealer Frederic Castaing, however, emphasises that true collectors "aren't that interested in the pecuniary value of a document. They love the touch of it, the sense of communing with a personage who is normally shut up in an encyclopedia" and argues that Lethier, "turn[ed] part of our cultural heritage into stocks and shares. It was detestable."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Lottery win==
In 2012, Lhéritier won the [[EuroMillions]] jackpot, with a prize of €170 million, the largest EuroMillions prize ever won in France.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35802891 Were investors conned into buying rare manuscripts?], Hugh Schofield, BBC Magazine 15 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Lhéritier's lawyer, Francis Triboulet, says that he immediately invested €40 million of the prize money into his company [[Aristophil]], which was "proof that it was legitimate".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

The '''Institute of Business Administration''' ('''IBA''') ({{lang-sd|'''انسٽيٽيوٽ آف بزنس ايڊمنسٽريشن'''}}) is an independent [[university]] in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. Founded in 1955, it is the oldest business school outside [[North America]] offering MBA degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/institute-business-administration-iba|title=Institute of Business Administration (IBA)|date=2015-07-16|newspaper=Top Universities|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBA was established as a business school in 1955 by Pakistani government with the technical support from the [[Wharton School]] and the [[University of Southern California]]. Several prominent American professors were assigned to the IBA to develop curriculum. In 1982, it became the first Pakistani institute to offer a four-year [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] undergraduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakpost.gov.pk/philately/stamps2005/iba_50_years.html|title=IBA 50 Years Of Excellence (1955-2005)|website=www.pakpost.gov.pk|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained a [[constituent college|constituent school]] within the [[University of Karachi]] until, in 1994, when its status was elevated to an [[Independent school|independent]] [[University charter|chartered]] university by the [[Sindh|Sindh Government]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IBACampusKarachi.jpg|thumb|right|The campus.]] --&gt;
IBA is the brainchild of Dr. I. A. Mukhtar, established in 1955 by the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) sponsored the program and approached the Wharton faculty to establish a business school in Karachi, Pakistan. The IBA offered post-graduate programs only for day scholars. In 1957, an evening program in graduate studies was started to cater to the needs of working executives and managers who were interested in furthering their careers through part-time business studies. In 1982, a three-year [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) (Honors) program was introduced; this was upgraded to a four-year program beginning fall of 2002. The institute's graduate program offering includes executive [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) for banking and financial services professionals, corporate managers, and public sector executives. These programs require work experience in the industry, resulting in a high average age of the class&amp;nbsp;– upwards of 30 years. Till 1994, the [[University of Karachi]] awarded degrees to the graduates. In that year, the [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh|Sindh Assembly]] elevated the institute's status to that of a degree-awarding institution.

The Center for Computer Studies (now renamed as the Faculty of Computer Science) was established in 1983 with the collaboration of [[IBM]], Pakistan. It offered a diploma in systems analysis. It now offers BBA (MIS), BS (Economics), BS (Economics and Mathematics), MBA (MIS) and BS (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology), MS (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology), and Ph.D. programs. In addition, a Ph.D. program in MIS/Computer Science and Engineering/ICT was launched in August 2005. The Ph.D. degree has been expanded to include Operations Research, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Numerical Analysis and Numerical Computing. The Center for Computer Studies is ranked number 1, according to the Higher Education Commission rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2005/11/13/local3.htm Archive]. 13 November 2005. ''Dawn''.

When established, the university had its only campus, called University campus, at [[Karachi University]]. Later another campus, known as City campus, was established for evening studies.

In 2006, the Institute of Business Administration was granted {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land by the Sindh Government for the development of an Education City in Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/11/19/local2.htm Archive]. 19 November 2006.

In the 1990s, Shapiro became controversial for his self-promotional television commercials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2002/06/29/Opinion/s.o-b.Lawyer.Validates.His.Title-257106.shtml?norewrite200607301230&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailyorange.com ''Daily Orange''] article "'S.O.B.' lawyer validates his title", published June 14, 2006 and accessed July 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in which he promised to obtain large financial settlements for accident victims,&lt;ref&gt;"Flamboyant personal-injury lawyer dealt a setback", Associated Press Newswires, 14 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; referred to himself as "the meanest, nastiest [[Son of a bitch|S.O.B.]] in town"&lt;ref name=Case&gt;Case, Dick, "Annoyed viewers find they can’t nail ads by ‘The Hammer’," ''Syracuse Herald-Journal'', 16 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have "aggressive courtroom prowess".&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Craig, Gary, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041220/NEWS01/412200312/1002/NEWS "'Hammer' Shapiro on other end of lawsuit"], ''Democrat and Chronicle'' published December 20, 2004 and accessed July 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His ads' visuals frequently included vehicle crashes, falling bodies, [[Satan]], threats of physical violence against defendants, images from the video game [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]], animals and people being hit by trains, and explosions.&lt;ref name="DemChronFeb07"&gt;Zeigler, Michael, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070201/NEWS01/702010341/1002/NEWS "Lawyers are asked to tone down ads"], ''Democrat and Chronicle'' published and accessed February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He also began selling not-for-profit [[t-shirt]]s which featured "a vicious beast with blood dripping from its fangs" and the words "Protected by Vicious S.O.B., Jim The Hammer Shapiro."&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

Shapiro sold all three law firms and now writes books. He is the author of ''Victims'' [sic] ''Rights to Maximum Cash'', ''Sue the Bastards'', ''Million Dollar Lungs'', ''Injury Victims'' [sic] ''Rights to Maximum Cash'', ''Instant Credit Repair'' and ''Get Back All Your Lost Investments!''.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

In 2007, Shapiro's advertisements were cited by the Rochester ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'' as partial inspiration for a new set of rules the New York State Court System has implemented that limit attorneys' advertisements. The new rules prohibit, among other things, nicknames such as "The Hammer".&lt;ref name="DemChronFeb07" /&gt; The [[United States Constitution|constitutionality]] of the rules was called into question when [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Frederick Scullin]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] permanently [[injunction|enjoined]] some of the provisions in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Law Journal]]'', [http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?hubtype=TopStories&amp;id=1185482031426 "Upset of Few Attorney Advertising Rules Could Signal Return of 'Heavy Hitters'"], Joel Stashenko, July 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bar discipline==
In 2002, Christopher Wagner, a former client, sued Shapiro for malpractice. Wagner was injured in a 1995 motor vehicle accident and had responded to Shapiro's commercials. Wagner claimed he had incurred $182,000 in medical bills, but Shapiro's firm, Shapiro and Shapiro, encouraged him to accept a settlement of $65,000, promising more money could be obtained in a lawsuit against the state of New York. However, the state had no liability and Shapiro never pursued any further action on Wagner's behalf.&lt;ref name=OHara&gt;O'Hara, Jim, Jury whacks TV ad lawyer: Jim "The Hammer" Shapiro hit with $1.5M malpractice, false advertising judgment, ''The Post-Standard Syracuse'', 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In its opinion suspending Shapiro, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, found that he had "never tried a case to its conclusion [in New York] and had conducted approximately 10 depositions."&lt;ref name=NYSCA&gt;''In re Shapiro'', 7 A.D.3d 120, 124, 780 N.Y.S.2d 680, 684 (N.Y. App. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro had lived in Florida since 1995, remotely supervising his New York office.&lt;ref name=NYSCA /&gt; Wagner's lawyer, Robert Williams, claimed Shapiro's firm in Rochester was staffed by one lawyer who had only taken four cases to trial. The New York Supreme Court jury found the law firm owned by Shapiro had engaged in [[misleading advertising]] and legal [[malpractice]] and awarded a $1.5 million judgment against Shapiro.&lt;ref name=OHara/&gt;

Consequently, In 2004 he was suspended from practicing law for one year in New York. In 2005 he was also suspended from practicing law for one year in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/clerk/disposition/2005/10/04-1276.pdf The Florida Bar v. James J. Shapiro], Supreme Court of Florida, October 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro said the decision to suspend him from practicing in New York was "unfair and unconstitutional" but claimed the ruling would have little effect because he had sold his Rochester office and was now promoting books.&lt;ref&gt;Mariani, John, "Court rules "The Hammer' can't practice; judges: TV ads false and lawyer tried to get business from a comatose victim", ''The Post Standard/Herald-Journal'', May 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2004, four additional former clients unsuccessfully sued Shapiro for unspecified damages, alleging he had engaged in misleading advertising and legal malpractice.&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Shapiro is known for his philanthropy in Rochester. Since 1996, he has donated $7,500 per year to elementary schools to purchase books. He has indicated that his goal is to put $600,000 worth of books into schools within ten years. In 1996, he donated {{convert|86.5|acre|m2}} of land worth $800,000 to the Rochester [[YMCA]]. He has also donated land in Rochester valued at $120,000 to be used as a park for children.&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Dunkin' Donuts]] parodied Shapiro in a commercial for its breakfast menu in 2010, with a sound-alike named Bob "The Bulldozer" Phillips. Phillips imitated Shapiro's "every single penny" advertisement almost to the letter.

'''John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton''' (5 July 1656 – 21 June 1708) was a Scottish politician.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of [[Robert Hamilton, Lord Presmennan]] (d. 1696). Having married Margaret, granddaughter of [[John Hamilton, 1st Lord Belhaven and Stenton]]; who had been made a peer by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1647, he succeeded to this title in 1679.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1681, he was imprisoned for opposing the government and for speaking slightingly of [[James II of England|James, duke of York, afterwards James VII and II]], in parliament, and in 1689 he was among those who asked [[William III of England|William of Orange]] to undertake the government of [[Scotland]]. Belhaven was at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] in 1689. He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Scottish privy council]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a director of and invested heavily in the Scottish Trading Company, which was formed in 1695 and was responsible for the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]] to set up a Scots colony on the [[Darién Province|Darien]] peninsula in [[Panama]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was also a proponent of agricultural improvement publishing a handbook, ''The Countryman's Rudiments'' in 1699.

He favoured the agitation for securing greater liberty for his country, an agitation which culminated in the passing of the [[Act of Security]] in 1705, and he greatly disliked the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of the parliaments]], a speech which he delivered against this proposal in November 1706 attracting much notice. He was, along with [[Andrew Fletcher (politician)|Andrew Fletcher]] of Saltoun, one of the most eloquent and inflammatory of politicians. Two of his speeches, one being the famous one of November 1706, were published in an appendix to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''History of the Union'' (first printed in 1710).

Later he was imprisoned, ostensibly for favouring a projected French invasion, and he died in London on 21 June 1708.

Belhaven's son, John, who fought on the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British Government]] side at the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]], became the 3rd Lord on his father's death. He was drowned in November 1721, whilst proceeding to take up his duties as governor of [[Barbados]], and was succeeded by his son John (d. 1764).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After the death of John's brother James in 1777 the title was for a time dormant; then in 1799 the [[House of Lords]] declared that William Hamilton (1765–1814), a descendant of John Hamilton, the paternal great-grandfather of the 2nd Lord, was entitled to the dignity. William, who became the 7th Lord, was succeeded by his son Robert (1793–1868), who was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Hamilton of Wishaw in 1831. He died without issue in December 1868, when the barony of Hamilton became extinct; in 1875 the House of Lords declared that his cousin, James Hamilton (1822–1893) was rightfully Lord Belhaven and Stenton, and the title descended to his kinsman, Alexander Charles (b. 1840), the 10th Lord.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert''' (14 February 1773 – 1 March 1847) was a [[France|French]] [[banker]] and [[natural history|naturalist]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Lyon]], the son of [[Étienne Delessert (banker)|Étienne Delessert]] (1735–1816), the founder of the first fire insurance company and the first discount bank in France. Young Delessert was travelling in England when the [[French Revolution]] broke out, but he hastened back to join the [[National Guard (France)|Paris National Guard]] in 1790, becoming an officer of artillery in 1793. His father bought him out of the army, however, in 1795 in order to entrust him with the management of his bank.

Gifted with remarkable energy, he started many commercial enterprises, founding the first [[cotton]] factory at [[Passy]] in 1801, and a [[sugar]] factory in 1802 where [[Jean-Baptiste Quéruel]] developed the industrial manufacture of sugar from sugar beet, and for which he was created a [[Nobility of the First French Empire|baron of the Empire]]. He sat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|chamber of deputies]] for many years, and was a strong advocate for many humane measures, notably the suppression of the Tours or revolving box{{what?|date=May 2017}} at the foundling hospital, the suppression of the death penalty, and the improvement of the penitentiary system. He was made regent of the [[Bank of France]] in 1802, and was also member of, and, indeed, founder of many, learned and philanthropic societies. In 1818 He founded with [[Jean-Conrad Hottinger]] the first [[savings bank]] in France, the [[Groupe Caisse d'Epargne]] and maintained a keen interest in it until his death in 1847.

He was also an ardent [[botanist]] and [[conchologist]]; his botanical library contained 30,000 volumes, of which he published a catalogue ''Musée botanique de M. Delessert'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;The author of the catalogue was Antoine Lasègue. See FA Stafleu, 'Benjamin Delessert and Antoine Lasègue', ''Taxon'' 19:920-936 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1218312] for biographical details of the two men and their relationship, and the historical importance of the book.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''Des avantages de la caisse d'épargne et de prévoyance'' (1835), ''Mémoire sur un projet de bibliothèque royale'' (1836), ''Le Guide de bonheur'' (1839), and ''Recueil de coquilles décrites par Lamarck'' (1841–42).

His major botanical collaborators were [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] and [[Pedro Cláudio Dinamarquez Clausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000001961 |title=JSTOR Global Plants |chapter=Delessert, Jules Paul Benjamin (1773-1847) |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the company changed its name to [[Maschinenbauanstalt Humboldt]] in honor of the famous German Scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. On December 1924, under the direction of Peter Klöckner, the company entered into a cooperative agreement with Motorenfabrik Deutz AG which would later become Humboldt-Deutz-Motoren AG. Peter Klöckner secured approximately 78% of the capital of Humboldt-Deutz-Motoren AG and an agreement was made to bind the company firmly to Klöckner Werke AG, as a subsidiary. In 1938, after a deal with Klöckner Werke AG, the company changed their name to Klöckner Humboldt Deutz AG.&lt;ref name="Kellenbenz, Hermann (Hrsg.): Zwei Jahrtausende Kölner Wirtschaft"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellenbenz|first=Hermann|title=Vom 18.

In the spring of 1969, the plant construction division was extended through the acquisition of a majority holding in Westfalia Dinnendahl Gröppel AG (Wedag) of Bochum. Further in 1972, Wedag and Humboldt merged to become KHD Industrieanlagen AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hast|first=Adéle|title=International directory of company histories|year=1991|publisher=St.James Press|page=543|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXgRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Wedag+and+Humboldt+finally+merged+in+1972,+to+become+KHD+Industrieanlagen+AG%22&amp;dq=%22Wedag+and+Humboldt+finally+merged+in+1972,+to+become+KHD+Industrieanlagen+AG%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JQtUsSzCsSBrQe5yIHIDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, after economic problems caused by misjudgments and bad investments combined with an unfavorable economic climate, the KHD group began a radical restructuring based on strategic business units, with KHD AG continuing to operate as a managing holding company. The group began showing a profit in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/khd-konzern-history/ KHD Konzern]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, KHD Humboldt Wedag acquired ZAB Zementanlagen und Maschinenbau GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secfilings.nyse.com/filing.php?ipage=4786988&amp;DSEQ=1&amp;SEQ=&amp;SQDESC=SECTION_PAGE Letter to Shareholders, p 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2005 the company was acquired by MFC Bancorp; after its successful recovery, the holding company itself changed its name to KHD Humboldt Wedag International Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Rand, [https://archive.is/20130703025140/http://www.forbes.com/2005/11/08/maxim-looksmart-marketocracy-in_mr_1108gurupicks_inl.html "Gurus Buy Into Europe, Sell Technology"], ''[[Forbes]]'', 8 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gibbons, [http://www.fool.com/investing/value/2007/07/13/a-potential-10-bagger.aspx "A Potential 10-Bagger"], [[The Motley Fool]], 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, KHD Humboldt Wedag divested its two subsidiaries, MBE Coal &amp; Minerals Technology and MBE Cologne Engineering, to concentrate on cement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koeln-nachrichten.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/unternehmen-news/article/humboldt-wedag-kein-weiterer-stellenabbau.html "Humboldt Wedag: Kein weiterer Stellenabbau"], Köln Nachrichten, 30 June 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/08/idUS150090+08-Oct-2009+PRN20091008 "KHD Humboldt Wedag International Ltd. Announces the Completion of the Sale of Its World-Wide Coal and Minerals Operations and Its Manufacturing Facility in Cologne"], Press release, [[Reuters]], 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the company split into Terra Nova and KHD Humboldt Wedag International AG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfcindustrial.com/Company_History Company History], MFC Industrial Ltd., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2011, KHD and [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China|AVIC Beijing Co. Ltd]] signed a strategic partnership agreement. Both companies work together to offer select, competitive, turn-key solutions for the cement industry by combining the strengths of KHD Technology, with AVIC`s construction experience and competitive cost platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khd.com/annual-report.html?file=tl_files/downloads/investor-relations-en/annual-report/2011/KHD_AG_Annual_Report_2011.pdf Annual Report 2011, p4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, KHD signed an exclusive and perpetual license agreement with [[Weir]] Minerals for HPGR (high pressure grinding rolls) technology. KHD would receive royalty payment on equipment sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/04/18/539234/0/en/DGAP-News-KHD-Humboldt-Wedag-International-AG-KHD-signs-License-Agreement-with-Weir-Minerals-for-HPGR-Technology.html Nasdaq OMX]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2013-04/26564411-khd-humboldt-wedag-international-ag-khd-unterzeichnet-lizenzvertrag-mit-weir-minerals-fuer-hpgr-technologie-016.htm FinanzNachrichten]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sept 2013, AVIC International Beijing Limited bid to acquire further 19.03% of shares in KHD Humboldt Wedag International AG. On the completion of these transactions, AVIC will hold total 39.03% of the shares in KHD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialpost.com/markets/news/AVIC+International+Beijing+Company+Limited+Announces+Acquisition+Further/9026465/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dec 2013,a joint statement by the management and supervisory Board said they welcome AVIC’s aim to continue its support of KHD’s current growth strategy and to maintain the commercial identity of the KHD Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cemnet.com/News/story/153455/khd-recommends-shareholders-accept-avic-offer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business concept ==
Apart from [[process engineering]] and [[project management]], the company's product portfolio is classified into grinding technology, burning technology and process automation. The company also has a centralized test center in [[Cologne]] and a dedicated [[spare part]]s and plant services division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=KWGG.DE " Reuters"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The list was consolidated and republished in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0059:EN:HTML Directive 2001/59/EC], where translations into other EU languages may be found.

These safety phrases are used internationally and not just in Europe, and there is an ongoing effort towards complete international harmonization. ''(Note: missing S-number combinations indicate phrases that were deleted or replaced by another phrase.)''

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Muri'''''|[[wikt:無理|無理]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "unreasonableness; impossible; beyond one's power; too difficult; by force; perforce; forcibly; compulsorily; excessiveness; immoderation",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (2003), 5th edition, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2537.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (''[[muda (Japanese term)|muda]]'', ''[[mura (Japanese term)|mura]]'', ''muri'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani  | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence  | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn  | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | ISBN = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoidance of muri in Toyota manufacturing==
Muri is one of three types of waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|muda]], [[mura (Japanese term)|mura]], muri) identified in the [[Toyota Production System]]. Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability.

Muri can be avoided through ''standardized work''.  To achieve this a ''standard condition'' or output must be defined to assure effective judgment of quality.  Then every process and function must be reduced to its simplest elements for examination and later recombination.
The process must then be standardized to achieve the standard condition. This is done by taking simple work elements and combining them, one-by-one into standardized work sequences.  In manufacturing, this includes:
* Work flow, or logical directions to be taken,
* Repeatable process steps and machine processes, or rational methods to get there, and
* [[Takt time]] (combined with production/demand leveling to provide for reasonable lengths of time and endurance allowed for a process e.g. if the takt is 10 minutes while there is no realistic way for a process to do its work in less than 20 minutes, Muri is the natural outcome).

When everyone knows the standard condition, and the standardized work sequences, the results observed include:
* Heightened employee morale (due to close examination of ergonomics and safety)
* Higher quality
* Improved productivity
* Reduced costs

== Implementation ==

In fact{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} the big contribution of [[Henry Ford]] and his manufacturing techniques was the reduction of Muri and not so much the [[production line]] itself. In order for the production line to function each station on the line had to achieve standard work because the next station was only equipped to work on standard condition components.

The Ford production line approximates to an implementation of [[Takt time]] which gives enough time to perform the standard work...

{{Expand Portuguese|date=December 2009|Associação Nacional do Transporte de Cargas e Logística}}

The '''Brazilian National Association of Cargo Transport and Logistics''' (pt-BR, "Associação Nacional do Transporte de Cargas e Logística"), '''NTC&amp;Logistica''', or simply '''NTC''') is a Brazilian organisation founded in 1963 by Orlando Monteiro and based in [[São Paulo]], with a branch in [[Brasilia]]. This association represents cargo carriers and [[Logistics|logistical operators]]. From its foundation until the mid-1990s, it represented only road cargo transport companies, but later it expanded its services to other transport modals, as well as to logistical operators (stocking and storage).  It is also responsible for calculating the Brazilian National Index of Transport Costs (INCT), which measures variations in costs incurred of the transport sector throughout the country. It gives a prize annually to companies for providing the best services to transport businesses (vehicles, suppliers, and others), through a satisfaction survey developed by Brazilian statistical institute [[Datafolha]].

The '''Remington Rand strike of 1936–37''' was a strike by a [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|federal union]] affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) against the [[Remington Rand]] company. The strike began in May 1936 and ended in April 1937, although the strike settlement would not be fully implemented until mid-1940.

The strike is notorious for spawning the "[[Mohawk Valley formula]]," a corporate plan for [[strikebreaking]] to discredit [[trade union|union]] leaders, frighten the public with the threat of violence, use local police and vigilantes to intimidate strikers, form puppet associations of "loyal employees" to influence public debate, fortify workplaces, employ large numbers of [[strikebreaker]]s, and threaten to close the plant if work is not resumed.  The Mohawk Valley formula was described in an article by company president [[James Rand, Jr.]], and published in the ''National Association of Manufacturers Labor Relations Bulletin'' in the fourth month of the strike.  The article was widely disseminated in pamphlet form by the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM) later that year.

In a landmark decision, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] called the Mohawk Valley formula "a battle plan for industrial war."&lt;ref&gt;Quote in "Glossary, History at the Department of Labor," U.S. Department of Labor, no date. The "Mohawk Valley formula" refers to the town of Ilion, New York, which is located in the [[Mohawk Valley]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In March 1934, the AFL began organizing skilled workers at two [[typewriter]] companies, [[Underwood Typewriter Company]] and Remington Rand.  The employees organized the District Council of Office Equipment Workers, a [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|federal union]] affiliated with the [[Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO|Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor]]. Six plants were organized in the towns of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]], [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in New York; in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; and in [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] and [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Rodden"&gt;Rodden, ''The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg"&gt;Stolberg, ''The Story of the CIO,'' 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Rand, Jr., president of [[Remington Rand]], refused to bargain with the union. On May 8, 1934, 6,500 workers struck to force the company to recognize the union and sign a [[collective bargaining]] agreement. On June 18, 1936, the firm recognized the union and signed a contract which provided wage increases and established a [[grievance]] procedure.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

Remington Rand, however, continued a policy of harassment and obstruction toward the union. It often violated the contract in small ways (forcing the union to file time-consuming and costly grievances), harassed union leaders, and generally contested the union at every turn.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medieval"&gt;"'Medieval, Shocking,' " ''Time,'' March 22, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1936, the District Council of Office Equipment Workers became the Remington Rand Joint Protective Board.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

==Beginning of the strike==
Worker anger had built high by May 1936, when the company spread rumors that its plants were being bought by an unknown firm that would no longer recognize the union. Remington Rand then announced it had purchased a typewriter plant in nearby [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] and might close the Tonawanda and Syracuse facilities. The union demanded information on possible plant closures, which the company refused.

The union then threatened a strike. In retaliation, the company distributed its own strike ballots and claimed that it alone could speak for workers. Outraged union officials seized and destroyed the company's ballots, interrupted and broke up meetings at which ballots were handed out, and harassed and physically intimidated managers trying to conduct balloting.&lt;ref&gt;"Syracuse Shop Shut by Remington Rand,"  ''Associated Press,'' May 22, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reshuffle"&gt;"Rand Reshuffle," ''Time,'' June 22, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB"&gt;''Remington Rand, Inc.'', 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Board quickly held its own strike vote. More than 75% of the union's members voted to strike. Union officials asked the company to submit the dispute to a federal mediator, but the company refused to do so. Instead, Remington Rand fired the presidents of the local unions in Tonawanda and Syracuse along with fifteen other union activists. Infuriated workers in Ilion, Syracuse and Tonawanda walked off their jobs on May 25, 1936, followed by Remington Rand workers in Ohio and Connecticut the following day.&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strike in 6 Plants of Remington Rand," ''New York Times,'' May 26, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded"&gt;"Six Rand Factories Guarded in Strike," ''New York Times,'' May 27, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence during the strike==
The Remington Rand strike was a particularly violent strike.  Although no one died during the strike, both sides{{qn|date=December 2012}} engaged in beatings with fists and clubs, rock and brick throwing, vandalism, threats and physical intimidation. But historians and federal officials point out that the company went out of its way to antagonize workers and use private security personnel (sometimes disguised as workers) to instigate violence and riots. The record before the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) and the scholarly literature show that the level of violence in the strike was deliberately manipulated by Remington Rand, and was several orders of magnitude higher than it would have been had the company not taken the actions it did.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medieval" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering"&gt;"'Whispering' Used to Break Ranks," ''New York Times.'' November 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable incidents include:
*In mid-June 1936, the company sent 100 strikebreakers through the picket line toward the front gate of the plant in Tonawanda.  The company deliberately withdrew its protection of the workers when they reached the picket line. A fight broke out between the strikebreakers and the 500 picketers. Tonawanda police, waiting nearby, descended on the picketers and beat hundreds with [[Club (weapon)|billy-clubs]].&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;
*Beginning July 3, 1936, a four-day running riot began around the Middletown, Ohio, plant.  The riot began when the company attempted to bring hundreds of strikebreakers through the picket lines unprotected. Over the following two days, workers hurled stones at strikebreakers, keeping them from entering the plant. When the company attempted to bring the workers in on buses on July 7, workers seized and boarded the buses, then forced the strikebreakers off the buses. Two were parked at the plant gates and torn apart. A third was chased by police through the streets of the town, only to crash on the lawn in front of City Hall.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HalfDozen"&gt;"Half Dozen Beaten in Rand Strike Riot," ''Associated Press,'' July 4, 1936; "Workers Stoned in Ohio Rand Strike," ''Associated Press,'' July 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"3 Buses Wrecked by Rand Strikers," ''Associated Press,'' July 8, 1936; "Deadlock Persists in Ohio," ''Associated Press,'' July 12, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On July 24, 1936, striking workers threw home-made bombs at plants in Middletown and Syracuse, injuring one policeman. The bombs did only minor damage.&lt;ref&gt;"Policeman Hurt By Strike Bomb at Rand Plant," ''United Press International,'' July 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 12, 1936, Syracuse police shot and injured two strikers, leading the governor of the state to threaten to bring in the [[New York Army National Guard|National Guard]] unless local authorities showed more restraint.&lt;ref name="Rand Strike 1936"&gt;"2 Shot in Rand Strike," ''Associated Press,'' August 13, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 22, 1936, striking workers at the Middletown plant hurled large iron balls at police, injuring four.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;"4 Hurt in Rioting at Rand Factory," ''Associated Press,'' August 23, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike tactics==
The Remington Rand strike is notable for the wide array of aggressive anti-union tactics employed by the employer. The [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) documented these tactics in a 120-page decision, ''Remington Rand, Inc.'', 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937).  The tactics used were not merely inventive (although some had been used by employers before), but, as the NLRB argued, were specifically designed and utilized to undermine the democratic process, manipulate public opinion through deceit and terror, and violate federal law.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;

===Plant closures===
With the union out on strike, Remington Rand quickly began consolidating its plants. The company later admitted that it had long wanted to close several of its plants, but that the union was too strong and would not have permitted it.  Remington Rand contracted with [[millwright]]s several months before the strike began (discussions which courts and federal agencies later interpreted as a sign of the company's bad-faith bargaining) to dismantle the plants.  Within days of the strike's commencement, Remington Rand contractors began crating plant machinery in Middletown, Syracuse and Tonawanda. Workers tried blocking the millwrights and trucks from entering and leaving the plant but were mostly unsuccessful. Strikers subsequently pelted trucks with stones, bricks and bottles, or laid iron spikes in the roadway to puncture the tires of trucks.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Rand Moves Machines," ''New York Times,'' June 5, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Acquitted"&gt;"Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking," ''New York Times,'' November 19, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misleading information about plant closures was also common. When the strike began, the [[List of mayors of Syracuse, New York|mayor of Syracuse]] met with Rand and won Rand's personal reassurance that the company would not close the plant.  But Rand planned exactly that, and his lie was designed to win backing of city officials for the company's anti-union campaign. The company also often placed "For Sale" signs in front of factories or announced their closing in advertisements. In some cases, the company went so far as to hire private security guards to pose as millwrights to support its claim that it was closing plants.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, ''From Blackjacks to Briefcases,'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Announcements of plant closures were designed to demoralize striking union members and frighten workers who had remained on the job into staying. They also were used to terrorize local citizens who feared for the economic life of their towns.  Often, company officials would later make statements suggesting that the plant would stay open if the union gave up the strike, statements which encouraged local citizens to put intense emotional, political and economic pressure on the union.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders"&gt;"U.S. Board Orders Remington Rand to Re-Employ 4,000," ''New York Times,'' March 15, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Threatens"&gt;"Threatens to Close a Remington Plant." ''Associated Press,'' June 13, 1936; "Remington Rand Drops 3 Plants," ''Associated Press,'' June 14, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of private security forces===
Remington Rand also hired very large numbers of private security forces to protect its property and attempt to re-open some facilities.  The company had engaged in extensive pre-strike planning with "detective agencies" (a euphemism for private security guard companies) in all its locations. In discussions with these firms, the company clearly conveyed the attitude that it had every intention of provoking a strike in order to break the union, and would not engage in good-faith bargaining.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt; One company which provided private security forces, led by Pearl Bergoff, received $25,850.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand, Bergoff and Chowderhead," ''Time,'' December 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Remington Rand claimed it had to hire its own private police forces to protect its property and the strikebreakers.  But the union and local officials argued that Remington Rand's real goal was to foment trouble. As Middletown Mayor Leo Santangelo pointed out: "There were more policemen outside than there were men wanting to come in."&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

===Support of local law enforcement===
Remington Rand also relied heavily on local police and specially-sworn county sheriff's deputies to provide protection. Several months before the strike began, the company informed local officials that it intended to provoke the union and would need the cooperation of local officials. Many enthusiastically did so, believing that the company would close its plants (harming the city's tax base) if they did not.  In Syracuse, for example, the mayor gave the company unlimited police protection.  Where local officials resisted the company's request for help, Remington Rand intimidated them into offering assistance.  The mayor of Ilion later admitted that he was forced to provide police protection: His own personal banker had threatened to call in his loans and delete his personal and business lines of credit, and a "citizens' committee" formed by the company threatened to institute a boycott against his business and a slander campaign against him personally if he did not cooperate.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PoliceProtect"&gt;"Police Will Protect Remington Workers," ''New York Times,'' May 28, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Syracuse Rand Plant Guarded," ''Associated Press,'' January 2, 1937; "Fear of 'Trouble' Attributed to Rand," ''Associated Press,'' November 9, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local law enforcement personnel played a particularly important role in terrorizing the population of Ilion and turning public opinion against the union. Remington Rand paid [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] to deputize 300 special sheriff's deputies to provide protection for company and town property. Remington Rand armed the deputies with Remington handguns and billy-clubs, and bought civilian automobiles to serve as squad cars. While these deputies and the town police remained under the control of their respective governmental authorities, the company worked closely with county and town officials to heighten tensions within the town.  Squads of six sheriff's deputies and one police officer were armed with shotguns and stationed at every road and path leading into the town. Local citizens had to obtain passes from the Remington Rand company to enter the town. Later, company officials disingenuously accused local police of using kid gloves on strikers, which gave local police the political cover they needed to increase the level of violence aimed at picketers.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Urges Police Club Syracuse Rioters," ''Associated Press,'' June 12, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Expose"&gt;"Union 'Expose' Used in Breaking Strike," ''New York Times,'' November 26, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of strikebreakers===
Remington Rand also fired all striking workers and replaced them with permanent replacements. Initially, few replacement workers were willing to take the company up on its offer. The union ringed each plant with thousands of workers, family members and supporters, and few replacement employees were willing to run the gauntlet of angry, sometimes violent union members.  Others feared reprisals against them and their families if they took work at the plant. At first, Remington Rand gave security guards a $5 a day bonus if they successfully made it past the picketers and into the plant, where they pretended to be workers.&lt;ref&gt;"Incited Violence, Strike Guards Say," ''Associated Press,'' September 24, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; But the company soon began offering large bonuses for replacement workers, and in the depths of the [[Great Depression]] few people could afford to turn down work.&lt;ref name="Acquitted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Offers Bonus for 800 Workers," ''New York Times,'' June 6, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misinformation===
Remington Rand also made a significant number of false and misleading statements designed to mislead the media, demoralize strikers and reassure investors. Sixteen days into the strike, for example, company president James Rand announced an end to the strike at all six plants, a statement which roiled the union and led hundreds of workers to mistakenly accuse elected union leaders of selling out.{{qn|date=December 2012}} In fact, no agreement had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand is Optimistic on Strike Trends," ''New York Times.'' June 11, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Remington Rand announced that workers in Ohio had returned to work under a new collective bargaining agreement which offered highly favorable terms. The announcement demoralized workers in New York and Connecticut, and raised suspicions about the competence and reliability of union leaders. The truth was that only 21 of the 911 workers at the plant had accepted these terms, and they had not supported the strike.&lt;ref name="Reopens"&gt;"Rand Plant Reopens," ''Associated Press,'' June 30, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Remington Rand officials falsely claimed that 5,300 of the company's workers had crossed picket lines and were back at work.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed"&gt;"Rand Pickets Curbed," ''Associated Press,'' July 19, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tonawanda, the company planted a rumor among the picketers that several union members were returning to work. The company then hired 85 security guards to impersonate these "returning workers," and armed them with bricks and clubs. When a pitched battle broke out between the impersonators and picketers, company photographers took pictures of the near-riot. The company shipped the security guards out of town that night and turned the photos over to the local newspapers—which duly printed them as "proof" that "labor goons" had attacked "honest working men."&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt; The corporation then used this incident to manipulate a state court into imposing a [[temporary injunction]] against the strikers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Misinformation was also used to frighten local citizens and manipulate public opinion. For example, on June 9, 1936, Remington Rand announced that it had employed 500 strikebreakers to resume production at its plant in Syracuse. In fact, the company had hired no replacement workers at all.  Working behind the scenes with the company, the local police then announced a major increase in the number of police protecting the Remington Rand plant.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hiring 500 to End Syracuse Strike." ''Associated Press.'' June 10, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; When violence died down in Ohio, President Rand announced he would "hire 1,000 men if necessary" to protect the plant.  Angry union members reinforced their pickets, and when Rand attempted to bring even a small number of guards to the plant they were pelted with stones—leading to the violence Rand had claimed already existed.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rand to Guard Plant," ''Associated Press,'' August 18, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other tactics===
The Remington Rand company also worked with local courts to influence the outcome of the strike.  The company used relationships and ''[[ex parte]]'' communications with judges prior to the strike to ensure that strikers would be dealt with harshly, although the number of these cases appears to be limited. In Syracuse, for example, two teenaged girls were sentenced to 30 days in jail for merely waving a rubber rat at replacement workers. In Middletown, local judges handed down six-month prison sentences to a large number of picketers based solely on the testimony of two Remington Rand security guards. In many cases, however, the company manipulated events to ensure that [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] judges would impose the maximum sentence or the outcome the company desired.  Remington Rand often incited picketers to riot. Working with local law enforcement officials, the company would then present evidence in court implicating workers but not management. This manipulation of the judicial system often led judges to severely restrict union picketing near company property. In New York, for example, a federal judge limited picketing to only four workers at a time, and all workers had to wear a large badge identifying themselves as such. (Nearly two years later, federal investigations exposed the company-law enforcement collusion.)&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hear Rand Strike Charge," ''Associated Press,'' July 1, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand also formed "citizens' committees" controlled by the company to put additional pressure on the union. Federal investigators later found that these citizens' committees were founded and funded by the company, and used to intimidate businessmen, banks and others into withdrawing support from or opposing the striking workers. In New York, for example, landlords raised the rent of strikers to put pressure on them to return to work.  Citizens' committees also put political pressure on local elected officials, bringing local and county law enforcement under the control of the firm.  In Ohio, local officials order law enforcement personnel to padlock and seal local union offices after minor pretextual complaints by company officials. In Elmira, the mayor ordered the police to ban circulation of the local labor newspaper. Citizens' committees were also used to secretly manipulate public opinion against the union and its members. Unaware of the true nature of these committees, the media often reported their demands for an end to the strike or denunciations of union "violence" – which encouraged the public to turn against the strikers.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, "Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict," ''Public Opinion Quarterly,'' March 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand also engaged in threats and intimidation. The company hired at least 80 men and women to pose as religious missionaries, and had these individuals visit strikers' homes. Once in the home, the "missionary" would harangue the family and demand that the breadwinner return to work. In other cases, groups of company employees posing as "concerned citizens" would mass in front of strikers' homes and demand that the worker abandon the picket line, leave town, or return to work.  These activities were often coordinated with company back-to-work campaigns and reinforced by mistaken media reports of large numbers of picket-line crossings.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

==Events during the strike==
Largely unprepared for the strike, the union was able to win at least one early battle against Remington Rand.  The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor of the state of New York, [[Herbert H. Lehman]], refused to allow the [[New York State Police]] to intervene in the strike, despite the company's demands.&lt;ref&gt;"Lehman Bars State Police in the Rand Strike," ''New York Times,'' June 6, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand began its misinformation campaign immediately. In mid-June, Remington Rand threatened to close its plants in Middletown, Norwood, Syracuse, and Tonawanda unless workers returned to work immediately. Politicians pleaded with union officials to end the strike.&lt;ref name="Threatens" /&gt; A few days later, Remington Rand announced (incorrectly) that union leaders in Ohio had accepted an offer to return to work. The announcement created deep divisions between leaders and members in the union, and between union chapters in the various plants. However, only 21 workers out of 911 had accepted the offer, and most of those had not been union members.&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reopens" /&gt;

On July 6, the union held a mass demonstration in Syracuse in support of workers in Ohio who had rioted over the previous days. Despite the size of the Syracuse riot, company officials declared the strike "definitely broken."&lt;ref name="HalfDozen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstration at Syracuse." ''Associated Press.'' July 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, a federal judge significantly restricted union picketing at Remington Rand's plants in New York. The union was limited to only four picketing workers at a time, and all picketers had to wear large badges identifying themselves as union members.&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt; Federal officials later determined that the violence which led the court to impose the injunction had been instigated by Remington Rand.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;

On July 22, Governor [[Wilbur L. Cross]] of Connecticut asked Governor [[Martin L. Davey]] of Ohio and Governor Lehman of New York to meet with him and Rand's president to discuss an end to the strike. Despite interest from the governors and union, Cross abandoned his plan for a tri-state arbitration committee after a spate of violence at Remington Rand plants and receiving a host of pre-conditions from Rand himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Asks Typewriter Co. Strike Parley," ''United Press International,'' July 23, 1936; "Asks Rand Strike Parley," ''Associated Press,'' July 23, 1936; "Lehman Backs Cross in Rand Peace Move," ''New York Times,'' July 24, 1936; "New Violence Marks Strike in Rand Plants," ''Associated Press,'' July 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union won a few skirmishes in the strike in August 1936. New York Governor Lehman ordered a special session of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate division of the New York Supreme Court]] to hear an emergency appeal of a state court ruling granting an injunction against the union under the State Anti-Injunction Law of 1935. The appeal was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;"Lehman Summons Court in Rand Case," ''New York Times,'' August 1, 1936; "Rand Strike Writ Upheld on Appeal," ''New York Times,'' August 19, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; After a fresh outbreak of violence in Syracuse on August 11, in which two strikers were shot and injured by local police, Governor Lehman threatened to replace policemen with National Guard troops unless local law enforcement authorities proved capable of more restraint.&lt;ref name="Rand Strike 1936"/&gt;

Contract talks begin in earnest in late July 1936, three months into the strike. The AFL had filed a variety of [[unfair labor practice]] (ULPs) charges against Remington Rand, but the company had won a temporary injunction halting any NLRB hearings on the ULPs in mid-July.&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt; Remington Rand officials were particularly concerned that NLRB hearings would expose their anti-union tactics. Company officials, worried that the [[United States Supreme Court]] and other federal courts would uphold the [[National Labor Relations Act]], began negotiations as a fall-back strategy. Those negotiations collapsed on September 2, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Strike Talks End," ''Associated Press,'' September 3, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point in the strike came 10 days later. [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|U.S. district court]] Judge John Knight lifted the temporary injunction and ordered the NLRB to proceed with its ULP hearings.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Concern Loses Plea for Injunction," ''Associated Press,'' September 13, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB hearings, as well as [[United States Senate]] hearings into strikebreaking in general, began in late September. Evidence of the extensive anti-union campaign in the Remington Rand strike became public in late November 1936, and made national headlines.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expose" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Strikebreaking Services,'' S. Report 6, Part I, Committee on Education and Labor, U.S. Senate, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1937, public exposure of the Remington Rand company's anti-union efforts had led to a significant deterioration in the firm's public support. The company did not cut back on its efforts, and rumor-mongering about plant closures and to demoralize workers was still effective. But public opinion and media opinion proved much harder to manipulate, and many elected officials were quietly withdrawing support for the company.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

On March 11, 1937, United States Secretary of Labor [[Frances Perkins]] attempted to mediate an end to the strike. When Perkins attempted to reach Rand by telephone, his aides claimed to not know where he was.  When Perkins sent him telegrams and letters, company staff said they did not know how to reach him. Perkins was forced to publish an open letter in newspapers in Connecticut, New York and Ohio, asking Rand to speak to her.  He did so the next day, but refused to discuss the strike with her. The incident embarrassed and angered Perkins, but Rand's rudeness further eroded the company's public standing.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Perkins Writes Open Letter to Rand," ''Associated Press,'' March 12, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 1937, the NLRB issued a decision finding Remington Rand guilty of violating federal labor law. The decision, ''Remington Rand, Inc.,'' 2 NLRB 626, was an astonishing 120-page decision in which the Board recounted nearly every anti-union tactic the company had undertaken in the last year. The Board accused Rand of putting himself above the law and wantonly violating the National Labor Relations Act. The Board's discussion of Remington Rand's actions was cast in moral terms. Although many of the actions were not necessarily illegal, the Board was deeply distressed that the company and its president would engage in behavior which, in the Board's view, constituted open economic and class warfare. The NLRB ordered Remington Rand to reinstate, with back pay, the union members who had been discharged, to reinstate all workers still on strike, to dismantle its company unions, and recognize the union in its six existing plants as well as the new plant in Elmira.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

Rand refused to obey the NLRB order. Instead, the same day that the Board issued its opinion, he agreed to meet with Perkins and discuss the strike.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand to Discuss Strike," ''Associated Press,'' March 13, 1937; "Remington Rand Defies U.S. Board," ''New York Times,'' March 16, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB's ruling, however, placed the company in a difficult legal position, and Remington Rand quickly reached an agreement with the union after a short session mediated by Perkins. Terms of the agreement were not released for a month.&lt;ref name="Approve"&gt;"Approve Rand Peace Plan," ''New York Times,'' April 21, 1937; "Strikers Approve Rand Peace Terms," ''New York Times,'' April 22, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB immediately sought a federal court ruling ordering Remington Rand to obey its orders.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Case Taken to Court by NLRB," ''Associated Press,'' March 18, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand's position in the strike worsened when a federal grand jury indicted James Rand, Jr., and [[Pearl Bergoff]], owner of Bergoff Industrial Service (a strikebreaking "detective agency"), of violating the [[Byrnes Act]], a federal law enacted in 1936 which forbade the interstate transportation of strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Jury to Hear Remington-Rand Case," ''Associated Press,'' April 11, 1937; "Rand and Bergoff Indicted by Federal Jury For Putting Strike-Breakers in Middletown," ''New York Times,'' April 13, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 1937, union members approved a settlement with Remington Rand permitting all workers to return to their jobs.  Initially, some workers refused to agree to the pact, but a month's lobbying by the AFL led to overwhelming passage.&lt;ref name="Approve" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strike Peace Delayed." ''New York Times.'' March 21, 1937; "Rehiring Is Ordered By Remington Rand," ''New York Times,'' April 20, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand and Bergoff were acquitted of violating the Byrnes Act on November 18, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Shaplen, "Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking," ''New York Times,'' November 19, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand, however, continued to resist the NLRB's order. But on February 14, 1938, Judge [[Learned Hand]], writing for a unanimous court, ruled in ''National Labor Relations Board v. Remington Rand, Inc.'' [[Case citation|94 F.2d 862]] (1938), that the company must obey the terms of the NLRB's decision.&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Denies Writ to Labor Board Against Remington-Rand in Labor Row," ''Associated Press,'' July 1, 1937; "Court Tells Rand to Recognize A.F.L.," ''Associated Press,'' February 15, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Remington Rand appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to grant [[certiorari]], thereby upholding the appellate court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;''Remington Rand v. National Labor Relations Board,'' cert denied, [[Case citation|304 U.S. 576]] (1938); "Remington Rand Appeals," ''Associated Press,'' April 17, 1938; "6,000 in Rand Units Strike Over Court," ''Associated Press,'' June 2, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand began slowly furloughing strikebreakers after the Supreme Court's refusal to hear its case.&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Rand Warned By Court," ''Associated Press,'' June 5, 1938; "Rand to Oust 800, Rehire Strikers," ''Associated Press,'' June 9, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the strike==
Another two years would pass before the NLRB's order in ''Remington Rand, Inc.'' would be fully implemented.

During the strike, Remington Rand had established [[company union]]s at all its plants.  Now the AFL and these company unions battled one another to represent the workers at the firm. In late June 1938, the company union demanded an immediate NLRB election to determine whether employees should continue to have a union or not.  The AFL argued that no election was appropriate until all striking workers had been rehired.  The two sides battled repeatedly over the election issue, and in October 1938 announced an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Ask Rand Vote at Once," ''Associated Press,'' June 26, 1938; "Rand Peace Reported," ''Associated Press,'' October 11, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand refused to implement the terms of the agreement, however.  In August 1939 the company union again petitioned the NLRB to hold elections to determine whether employees wished to have a union or not. The union filed a series of ULPs in September and October, leading to another round of NLRB hearings.  The situation deteriorated so badly that union members in Tonawanda struck in early April 1940.  The strike spread and violence quickly broke out.  Unwilling to undergo another large strike, Remington Rand agreed to dismantle its company unions on April 8, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"NLRB Vote Is Asked By Remington Rand," ''Associated Press,'' August 8, 1939; "Stay Asked Against NLRB," ''Associated Press,'' October 3, 1939; "Rand Offers Labor Peace," ''Associated Press,'' March 29, 1940; "Rand Strike Spreads," ''Associated Press,'' April 6, 1940; "Rand-A.F.L. Strife Settled by NLRB," April 9, 1940; "Rand Striker Held in Shooting," ''Associated Press,'' April 10, 1940; "Orders Rand Mediation," ''Associated Press,'' April 11, 1940; "Remington Rand Strike Ends," ''Associated Press,'' May 3, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the series of agreements with the AFL and the NLRB, Remington Rand continued to resist implementing the court's order. On June 4, 1940, the NLRB filed suit against the company seeking to have it declared in contempt of court.  Remington Rand had enough, and on June 30, 1940, agreed to dismantle its company unions and recognize the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Plant Shut," ''Associated Press,'' June 5, 1940; "Remington Rand, Inc., Bows to NLRB Order," ''New York Times,'' June 30, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Mohawk Valley formula"==
{{main|Mohawk Valley formula}}
The June 1936 issue of the NAM's ''Labor Relations Bulletin'' immortalized the "Mohawk Valley formula" as a classic blueprint for [[union busting]].  The nine-point formula, as devised by James Rand, Jr., is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Rodden, ''The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When a strike is threatened, label the union leaders as "agitators" to discredit them with the public and their own followers. Conduct balloting under the foremen to ascertain the strength of the union and to make possible misrepresentation of the strikers as a small minority. Exert economic pressure through threats to move the plant, align bankers, real estate owners and businessmen into a "Citizens' Committee."
# Raise high the banner of "law and order", thereby causing the community to mass legal and police weapons against imagined violence and to forget that employees have equal right with others in the community.
# Call a "mass meeting" to coordinate public sentiment against the strike and strengthen the Citizens' Committee.
# Form a large police force to intimidate the strikers and exert a psychological effect. Utilize local police, state police, vigilantes and special deputies chosen, if possible, from other neighborhoods.
# Convince the strikers their cause is hopeless with a "back-to-work" movement by a puppet association of so-called "loyal employees" secretly organized by the employer.
# When enough applications are on hand, set a date for opening the plant by having such opening requested by the puppet "back-to-work" association.
# Stage the "opening" theatrically by throwing open the gates and having the employees march in a mass protected by squads of armed police so as to dramatize and exaggerate the opening and heighten the demoralizing effect.
# Demoralize the strikers with a continuing show of force. If necessary turn the locality into a warlike camp and barricade it from the outside world.
# Close the publicity barrage on the theme that the plant is in full operation and the strikers are merely a minority attempting to interfere with the "right to work". With this, the campaign is over—the employer has broken the strike.

Marley took temporary custody of their five children while Hill served a three-month prison sentence for tax evasion in 2013.

However, in 2011, Marley produced a Haitian divorce decree which demonstrated that he had divorced Khawly in 1996.&lt;ref name="The Avah Taylor Company"/&gt;

Marley was briefly engaged to [[Isabeli Fontana]], but the engagement ended in early 2013.&lt;ref name="Rohan Marley Ends Engagement"/&gt;

'''Sokratis Kokkalis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Σωκράτης Κόκκαλης; 1939) is a Greek billionaire businessman. His father, [[Petros Kokkalis]], was a communist politician and [[Greek Resistance]] member, living in exile in [[East Germany]] after the end of the [[Greek Civil War]].

==Business==
Kokkalis is the founder and majority shareholder of [[Intracom]] Holdings, one of the largest multinational technology groups in Southern Europe{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}, and the Chairman and majority shareholder of [[Intralot|Intralot S.A.]], a [[Video game|gaming]] technology supplier and licensed lottery operator. He has established and presides over the [[Kokkalis Foundation]], a non-profit organization that "promotes education and training, culture and social welfare, medical research and information technology, and athletics", both in Greece and abroad. In 2015 Socrates Kokkalis net worth is estimated to be around US$1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rich List 2005: Top Ten Wealthiest Dynasties in Greece and Turkey|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/blog/2006/01/24/the-rich-list-2005-top-ten-wealthiest-dynasties-in-greece-and-turkey/|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Business Insider|date=24 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokkalis founded Intracom in 1977 as a telecommunication equipment supplier and manufacturer. The company played a leading role in the modernization of telecommunication infrastructure in Greece, especially through a partnership with [[Ericsson]] for the manufacturing of digital switches. Intracom expanded in Southeastern Europe and became a leading exporting technology Group, including the areas of software for the public sector, defense electronics and construction. It is listed in the [[Athens Stock Exchange]] since 1990.

Kokkalis founded Intralot in 1992, as a hardware and software supplier for the gaming industry. Intralot became one of the three top companies in the sector worldwide, currently with 5,400 employees and presence in 35 countries. Intralot has a strong presence in the [[United States]], with a 20% market share for lotteries, offering its services to 11 [[State lotteries|State Lotteries]].

Kokkalis also led [[Panafon]], the mobile venture of [[Vodafone]] in Greece, immediately after the launch of mobile telephony in Greece in 1992.

In 2005 INTRACOM became a Holding company and acquired [[Hellas Online]], an ISP provider which became a major telephony and Internet supplier. Hellas Online was sold to Vodafone in 2014. The same year Intracom Holdings divested also form the telecom manufacturing arm, Intracom Telecom. The Holding today owns three major companies, the construction branch Intrakat, the software developer Intrasoft International, which is an ORACLE partner and a major supplier to the European Commission and the European Parliament, and Intracom Defense Electronics, with a strong partnership with RAYTHEON. The three companies today employ 2,200  people and have presence in 70 countries around the world. Most of the Group revenues come from exports and international activities.

==Football==
Kokkalis was, for 18 years until 30 December 2010, owner and chairman of the Greek football club [[Olympiacos FC]]. He took the club after the difficult years of the [[George Koskotas|Koskotas scandal]] and managed to bring it back in success.

During his tenure the club won 12 [[Superleague Greece|top division]] titles, five [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cups]], and one [[Greek Super Cup]]. It was also during his chairmanship that Olympiacos leased from the Greek state and for a period of 50 years their homeground [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], which was until that time used by Olympiacos and other Piraeus clubs strictly on a rental basis, and undertook a complete rebuilding of the stadium itself.&lt;ref name=ath&gt;[http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13425/35949 "End of an era as Kokkalis retires"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210083520/http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13425/35949 |date=December 10, 2011 }}, ''[[Athens News]]'', 8 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
German authorities' investigations in the [[Stasi]] archives found a 350-page report referring to agent "Rocco" ("953/63") and later "Kaskade" and "Krokus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/el/capital-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-stasi-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BC%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%82/a-3704613 Capital: «Από πράκτορας της Stasi, δισεκατομμυριούχος]&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that "Rocco" was the code name for Sokratis Kokkalis, allegedly recruited on 25 January 1963.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Kokkalis was alleged to have subsequently bribed Greek officials in order for the [[OTE|national telecommunications company of Greece]] to purchase [[East Germany|East German]] telecommunications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101226172054/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympiakos-soccer-chief-was-spy-for-stasi-661893.html Olympiakos soccer chief was 'spy for Stasi'], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 February 2002 {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1832174.stm "Stasi spy claims hit Greek magnate"], [[BBC News]], 20 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Federal Parliament, conducted a detailed investigation and concluded in 1998, that there has been no evidence linking Kokkalis activities and his companies to the DDR.

Kostas Tsimas, a former chief of the Greek intelligence service (EYP) and very close friend of former Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]], stated that Kokkalis is "a Greek patriot", who "worked for Greek national interests in the Balkans and elsewhere".&lt;ref&gt;Eleftherotypia, February 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokkalis was criticized by Greek and international media about his activities in Russia, where his company Intralot had sold lottery equipment, technological know-how and software.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; However, no formal charges were ever filed for any Intralot representative, and the Russian government expressed its trust in Kokkalis and Intralot.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;[https://archive.is/20130217163734/http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/12950/7563 "Kokkalis under attack], ''Athens News'', 22 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive criticism was also received in the Romanian press by Kokkalis and the companies Intralot and Intracom for allegedly bribing Romanian officials into signing and extending contracts between the Greek firms and the Romanian Lottery that were thoroughly disadvantageous for the Romanian side, with losses totalling up to 1bn Euros as of April 2014.&lt;ref name=articleRomanian1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/mafie-si-spionaj-la-compania-greceasca-intralot-cea-care-a-tepuit-si-romania-de-sute-de-milioane-de-euro-98110 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011135434/http://www.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/mafie-si-spionaj-la-compania-greceasca-intralot-cea-care-a-tepuit-si-romania-de-sute-de-milioane-de-euro-98110 |archivedate=2013-10-11 |df= }}, ''Ziua News'', 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=articleRomanian2&gt;[http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/Romania+furata/ROMANIA+FURATA+Politicienii+si+firmele+care+au+pagubit+Loteria+R], ''Digi24'', 2 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Kokkalis was made a [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] fellow in 1997, and received awards from The [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[American Academy of Achievement]] for "his leadership in creating educational opportunities and building bridges of cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaepis.org/pages/PhidippidesAward-SOCRATESP.KOKKALIS.htm Socrates P. Kokkalis] biography at Cosmos FM radio station's website&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Kokkalis founded a scholarship program at Harvard bearing his name, which during 15 years offered fellowships for 80 graduates of master's degree Programs at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and 3,000 Executive Training opportunities for individuals from Southeastern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13793">The '''South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation''' (SEAFO) is an organization that maintains controls over fishing and fishing related acts in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean.

==Introduction==

Predating the Independence of [[Namibia]] in 1990, the [[International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries]] (ICSEAF) was responsible for the management of the [[fisheries]] in the region both in the [[exclusive economic zones]] of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]] and in the adjacent water of the high seas.  ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariat]] located in [[Madrid]], Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of [[Distant Water Fishing Nations]] (DWFNs).  ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms.  Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as [[hake]], [[horse mackerel]] and [[pilchards]] off Namibia and horse mackerels (''[[Trachurus capensis]]'' and ''[[Trachurus trecae|T. trecae]]'') and sardinellas ([[Sardinella aurita]] and ''[[Sardinella maderensis|S. maderensis]]'') in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988.  At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it.  Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body.  With new mandate and direction, SEAFO replaced ICSEAF.

SEAFO is an intergovernmental regional fisheries management organisation responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources (excluding migratory fish stocks) in the high seas of southeast [[Atlantic Ocean]], within the Convention Area. The SEAFO Convention Area is situated in the southeast Atlantic region, outside the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states of Angola, Namibia, South Africa and United Kingdom’s overseas territory of [[St. Helena]] and its dependencies [[Tristan da Cunha]] and [[Ascension Island]].  It covers an area of about 16 million square kilometres. The idea to establish SEAFO came from Namibia in 1995 because of the concern that certain commercially valuable straddling fish stocks required better protection to avoid compromising their potential in Namibian waters as a result of unsustainable fishing practices on the adjacent high seas.  The idea was welcomed and greatly supported by the coastal neighbours of Angola, South Africa and United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and by DWFN's of [[European Union|EU]], [[Iceland]], Japan, Norway, [[Poland]], [[Republic of Korea]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Ukraine]] and United States – all of which have history of fishing or demonstrated real interest in the fisheries in the area.

Complex negotiations between the coastal States and the DWFN started in 1997 and were completed in 2000 with the adoption of SEAFO Convention.  SEAFO Convention is largely based on 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the 1995 [[United Nations Fish Stock Agreement]] (UNFSA) and is internationally hailed as the most contemporary, responsive instrument for conservation and sustainable utilisation of living marine resources in high seas. The Convention was signed on 20 April 2001 in [[Windhoek]] by Angola, the European Community, Iceland, Namibia, Norway, Republic of Korea, South Africa, United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and the United States of America.  It entered into force on 13 April 2003 after the deposit of instruments of ratification by Namibia and Norway and approval by the European Community.  Angola deposited its instrument of ratification on 7 March 2006, making it a 4th Contracting Party of SEAFO.  The role played by the developing coastal States in the drafting of SEAFO Convention was extensive.

The Commission is the highest decision-making body of the Organisation and it meets annually to among others, formulate fisheries conservation and management measures, review compliance issues and adopt the budget.  Decision on matters of substance, within SEAFO is taken by consensus among the Parties. There is also a provision for non acceptance of a decision by a Contracting Party. Budgetary contributions are made up of an equal basic fee and a fee determined from the total catch of species covered by the Convention. SEAFO allows States and regional economic integration organizations to become parties to the Convention and encourages cooperation with non-Parties.  Compliance with monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) is one of the criteria for consideration in determining the nature and extent of participatory rights in SEAFO fishing opportunities.  SEAFO Convention foresees the creation of a robust system of observation, inspection, compliance and enforcement that includes control measures linked to flag State duties and port State duties as well as at-sea and in port inspection, boarding and inspection of vessels on a reciprocal basis, observer programs and procedures to follow up on infringements.  For transparency and openness, SEAFO accords accessibility of observers to its meetings and to its documents. SEAFO Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the conservation and management issues such as the status of the resources and the harvesting levels.  Subsidiary bodies may be established by the Commission, as needs arise, from time-to-time. The day-to-day work of the Organisation is coordinated, administered and overseen by the Secretariat, based in [[Swakopmund]], Namibia.

==General Principles==

SEAFO Convention provides fundamental principles that govern conservation and management of living marine resources under SEAFO's jurisdiction. [[Fisheries]] management is based on the best available scientific evidence, and where scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate, the precautionary approach principle prevails, until such time when more information is known about the resources dynamics, [[ecosystem]] structures and functions. The general principles encompass the concept of [[ecosystem approach to fisheries]] management.  In particular conservation and protection of species that belong to the same ecosystem as, or are associated with or dependent upon the harvested fishery resources (e.g., [[seabird]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and marine [[turtle]])s are given emphasis.  In addition the general principles call for the minimization of harmful impacts on all living marine resources and protection of marine environment and its biodiversity.

==Fish stocks covered==

Living marine resources covered by SEAFO including fish (such as [[orange roughy]] ''Hoplostethus atlanticus'', alfonsino ''[[Beryx splendens]]'', Patagonian toothfish ''[[Dissostichus eleginoides]]'', [[hake]] ''[[Merluccius paradoxus]]'', horse mackerel ''[[Trachurus capensis]]'', chub mackerel ''[[Scomber japonicus]]'', cardinalfishes ''[[Epigonus]]'' species, [[Oreosomatidae|oreo dories]] and armourhead ''[[Pseudopentaceros]]'' species, some [[shark]] species and [[Batoidea|rays]]), [[Mollusca|molluscs]] (such as [[octopus]] and [[squid]]) and [[crustacean]]s (such as deep sea red crab ''[[Chaceon maritae]]''). Some of the most notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino  – harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab  – capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as [[tuna]], [[swordfish]], [[marlin]] and sharks in the region are covered by the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500&amp;nbsp;m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over–exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.

==Conservation and management regime==

SEAFO has adopted innovative ways to manage deep sea fisheries, taking into account the EAF management, the precautionary approach principles as well as the reliance on the best scientific available evidence.  Since 2005 and 2007, the following conservation and management measures were adopted:

* Limiting catches for deep sea red crab and Patagonian toothfish in South East Atlantic waters due to concerns on the sustainability of the current fisheries and of the potential negative impacts on the vulnerable marine habitats
* Reducing incidental mortality of seabirds, especially [[petrels]] and [[albatrosses]], by fishing gear adjustments and other technical measures during fishing operations
* Prohibiting the “[[shark finning]]” practice whereby vessels cut the valuable shark fins off and retain them on board while discarding the carcass of the shark
* Reducing incidental mortality of sea turtles in fishing operations, notably by promptly releasing turtles entangled in fishing gear
* Implementing closed areas in numerous fragile marine ecosystems such as [[seamounts]] to ensure long-term conservation and protection in line with precautionary approach principles while more scientific information is becoming available.

For monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing activities, SEAFO has adopted comprehensive and stringent measures including the following:

* Mandatory on board the fishing vessel a scientific observers in order to collect the required catch and biological data on the stocks
* Mandatory automatic satellite [[vessel monitoring system]] (VMS) for all vessels fishing in the SEAFO area
* Port State inspection scheme based on standards set forth in the FAO Model Scheme 
* Prohibiting fishing activities in vulnerable marine areas with prominent seamounts
* Banning of transshipments at sea in order to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries (IUU)
* Establishment of a Register of SEAFO-authorised fishing vessels 
* Established a list of vessels presumed to have carried out IUU fishing activities including IUU vessels that are in the IUU lists of [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization]] ([[NAFO]]), [[North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission]] ([[NEAFC]]) and the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)]].

==Cooperation with other organisations==

SEAFO recognizes the need to cooperate with coastal States and all other States and Organisations having a real interest in the fishery resources of the South East Atlantic Ocean.  At regional level, SEAFO and Angola, Namibia, South Africa and UK’s overseas territories in the region are working closely to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures adopted for straddling fish stocks on the high seas and in areas of national jurisdiction. SEAFO has strong link with the [[Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme]] (BCLME) and the [[Benguela Current Commission]] (BCC) and shares information on the fisheries and the environment.

At international level, SEAFO has working relationships with various regional fisheries management organisations, notably North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NAFO) and the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  Cooperation with these organisations is centred on the exchange of experiences on all matters of mutual interests, including on sharing of data on by-catch species and information on compliance matters such as on IUU fishing activities.  SEAFO is working closely with the [[United Nations]] in particular with FAO and with the [[Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea]] (DOALOS) aiming at strengthening high seas fisheries governance.

'''Space Bucks''' was a space trading simulation developed by [[Impressions Games]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]]. The game focuses on the creation of a trade empire against several computer controlled opponents. Victory is achieved through a combination of infrastructure investments, the stock market, piracy, sabotage, and of course trade goods.

==Plot==
In the year 2375, Humans share the galaxy with four other races, the Colikars, Tesarians, Secanii, and the Krec N'had. Your fledgling trading company, consisting of a single port and a single ship, must, by the year 2500, expand by any means necessary to become the dominant trade empire in the galaxy. Three computer opponents will be pursuing the same goal.

==Gameplay==
There are numerous mechanics for the player to utilize in order to achieve victory.

===Ships===
Ships do the heavy lifting in the game. Without ships, the goods produced at planets can't be transported and the highest level goods can't be manufactured due to a lack of the appropriate resources. At the start of the game only a few ship types are available. As the game progresses new, more advanced ship types become available.

Ships have several stats which determine its suitability for use. Range, Speed, Capacity, Efficiency, Drive, and Maintenance cost.

===Planets===
Planets generate all of the trade goods in the galaxy. These goods range from food, to passengers, to luxury goods. The higher in development a planet is, the more and the greater the variety of goods that are produced. Once the highest levels of development can be reached the most expensive, and thus profitable, goods can be manufactured.

To gain access to a planet, a bid must be made on a planet which does not already have a deal with another trade company. The player must open negotiations with such a planet and if their demands are agreed to, they will ally themselves with the players trade company. The demands include a monthly rent paid by the player, the delivery of a specified good at regular intervals, and an agreement to build a specified piece of infrastructure on the planet within a certain timeframe. The demand for monthly rent is made for every planet, with the other two demands being optional and dependent on the developmental level of the planet.

Planets have morale which can be modified by in-game factors. Investing in planetary infrastructure can often help improve the morale of a planet and ensure docking rights are not lost. Should a planet be lost to an unhappy local populace, the player must begin negotiations for docking rights again. The higher the developmental level of the planet, the more infrastructure will be needed to keep the planet happy.

===Trade Goods===
Trade goods include fuel, food, passengers, and exotic goods such as wine and weapons. Each race produces different high-end goods than it consumes.

===Stock Market===
Each trading company has stock which can be sold on the market for an infusion of cash. Buying out the competition, by accumulating a majority of their stock, is possible. Stock can be bought and sold throughout the game, making it possible to sell lots of stock early for an early boost and then buy it back when the other companies sell off the shares they own.

===Piracy===
Pirates can be hired to harass the competition. They can be paid to harass the player as well. When a pirate attacks there are only a couple of options, pay them off, try to run, or fight back. The correct action to take will depend heavily on the specific ship being threatened and the upgrades that it has been outfitted with.

===Sabotage===
Sabotage missions can be undertaken to hurt the competitions bottom line. Of course the competition can do the same to the player.

===News Events===
A very basic mechanic, News Events inform the player of all the important events such as new ships, engines, or weapon systems which have become available. Sudden changes in the markets may also be announced throughout the game, giving the player the chance to make a quick profit.

==Critical reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' focused on the lack of anything to do in the game besides bid for landing rights and choose cargo: "No cut-throat strategy for undermining the competition's prices, no sabotage of trading routes, no space battles - not even the occasional price war." He recommended that players get "much better" business sims such as ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'' or ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]'' instead, and gave it 1 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Space Bucks |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1996|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Village (Gamer's Zone) wrote "The plot was a little thin for my taste, but if reading the business section of the paper excites you, then this game would be a must for you. The main weakness that I see in this program is lack of originality. I see parts of Railroad Tycoon, Civilization, Sim City among others, as well as the obvious connection to Air bucks v1.2. Nothing wrong with recycling older programs, especially as hardware improvements allow the newer versions to make improvements on game performance. That is what happened with this game. Unfortunately, it has a rushed feeling and fails to capitalize on the improvements there were put in the game."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/spacebuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said "If you love to create ornate moving sculptures that generate endless money but do very little else interesting, then SPACE BUCKS will have some appeal for you. Set at its hardest level, the game offers two or three hours of challenge before your empire grows to the point that nothing can really harm it and you simply sit around absorbing planets from your competitors and doing more and more unwieldy upgrades to your entire fleet. Other than that, it is pretty to look at, but definitely no AIR BUCKS in Space."{{cn|date=April 2017}} ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' wrote "Dealing with manufacturing, the bank and stock market, and random events do add a few things (bowling pins and knives?), but there still aren't a lot of different things to do (as in, say, Sim City or Capitalism). Despite this, you have to watch these things very closely, and it is easy for things to go critical very quickly. At the beginner level I played (and quickly lost) four games before I'd gotten a business that was even barely stable (and I was at the bottom of the pack). Maybe I just don't have a nose for business, but my attention wasn't strongly held. Beginning business sim fans might get more out of Space Bucks than I did, but I suspect advanced gamers will want to stick with a more detailed game like Capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20031103233809/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/005/087/space_bucks_review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cost of Freedom''''' was an American [[business]] [[Block programming|program block]] on the [[Fox News Channel]], which runs from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET Saturdays and several times throughout the weekend on sister network [[Fox Business Network]], while a short segment called ''Money Break'' airs on FBN during weekend programming. The block consisted of:
* ''[[Bulls &amp; Bears]]'', last hosted by [[Dagen McDowell]];
* ''[[Cavuto on Business]]'', last hosted by [[Neil Cavuto]];
* ''[[Forbes on Fox]]'', last hosted by [[David Asman]]; 
* ''[[Cashin' In]]'', hosted by [[Trish Regan]].
The different shows have a number of different business analysts, some of which are exclusive to specific shows while others rotate between the shows (except for ''Forbes on Fox'', which will feature a guest analyst on its "Makers and Breakers" segment, but not one from the rotating list).

On some weeks, the block may air live as one two-hour show if a big news or business-related story breaks out during the week. These special editions of ''The Cost Of Freedom'' are hosted by Cavuto or Asman if the former is not available.

In December 2017, it was announced that the ''Cost of Freedom'' block will be replaced by a new two-hour show, ''[[Cavuto Live]]'', hosted by [[Neil Cavuto]], beginning on January 20, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Fox News Channel Taps Neil Cavuto to Anchor Live Two-Hour Saturday News Program|url=http://press.foxnews.com/2017/12/fox-news-channel-taps-neil-cavuto-to-anchor-live-two-hour-saturday-news-program/|agency=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/neil-cavuto-anchor-saturday-morning-two-hours-fox-news-channel-1202226128/ |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=Neil Cavuto To Anchor Two Hour ‘Cavuto Live’ On Fox News Channel’s Saturdays |date=December 13, 2017 |accessdate=January 19, 2018 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William McReynolds Agee''' (January 5, 1938 – December 20, 2017) was an American business executive. In 1976 at age 38, he was appointed president and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Bendix Corporation]].  From 1988 to 1995, Agee was the chairman, president, and CEO of [[Morrison-Knudsen]].

Agee was a business consultant, [[Private equity#Venture capital|venture capitalist]], and chairman of a [[Foundation (non-profit)|charitable foundation]]. He received six honorary doctorate degrees and sat on the boards of [[Fortune 500]] corporations including [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life]] and [[Dow Jones]] as well as Bendix and Morrison Knudsen. In 1979, Agee was featured in a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine cover story titled "Faces of the Future", and was named ''Finance'' magazine's "Financial Man of the Year" in 1976.

==Early years==
Born as William McReynolds Agee in [[Boise, Idaho]], he was the middle child (and only son) of Harold J. and Suzanne (McReynolds) Agee. Harold, the son of a [[Baptist]] minister, had varied careers: manufacturing executive, dairy farmer, and state legislator.

Harold moved the family to a dairy farm in nearby [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] in 1953, and Bill transferred to [[Meridian High School (Idaho)|Meridian High]] at age 15.  He quickly established himself as a bright and popular student with leadership skills. Agee was elected class president in that first year as a sophomore and again in his senior year. He was a multi-sport varsity athlete and was named one of the two most studious members of his class, which graduated in 1956.&lt;ref name=reffort&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950612&amp;slug=2125987 |newspaper=Seattle Times |last=Hopkins|first=Jim |agency=''(Idaho Statesman)''|title=Reversal of fortune - It took two Agees to tangle with events leading up to MK's near destruction |date=June 12, 1995 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ybscbc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tisEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6763,2158885 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=''(New York Times)'' |title=Youth, bold style characterize Bendix chief |date=October 13, 1980|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After graduation from Meridian High School in 1956, in Agee attended [[Stanford University]] for one year before dropping out. He enrolled in the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], where he joined the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity,&lt;ref name=btpwa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/199|publisher=''Gem of the Mountains'', University of Idaho yearbook|title=Beta Theta Pi|date=May 1960|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; unusual for a married man. He earned an [[associate's degree]] while working 40 hours per week in [[Albertsons LLC|Albertson]]'s accounting department. Agee was elected senior class president and graduated with highest honors in 1960.&lt;ref name=gem60&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/304|publisher=''Gem of the Mountains'', University of Idaho yearbook|title=Top fifteen seniors: William Agee|year=May 1960|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1959, Agee, along with his parents, played the part of the Dixon family in the ephemeral film ''[[Last Clear Chance]]''. Following graduation, Agee worked for the [[Title insurance in the United States|Title Insurance]] Company in Boise. He was promoted to [[comptroller|controller]] and senior escrow officer at the age of 23. Agee enrolled in the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1961 and was awarded a [[Masters in Business Administration]] (MBA), with distinction, in 1963. He became a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) in 1964 and joined the American and Idaho societies of CPAs.

==Boise Cascade==
Agee was hired by [[Boise Cascade Corporation]] at age 25.  Starting as Executive Assistant to CEO Bob Hansberger,&lt;ref name=pfognwpt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AWRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5_EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7290%2C3622758 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |title=Paper firm official gets new post |date=May 25, 1964 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agee was appointed [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) in 1969 at age 31,&lt;ref name=bcvigrwth&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LTkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7239%2C3793068 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Boise Cascade's virus is growth |date=February 18, 1970 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senior Vice President in 1971.&lt;ref name=artttwm&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C6RQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_10DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4319%2C3969567 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |agency=Field Newspaper Syndicate |title=Agee's rise to the top was made without serious setbacks |last=Sloan |first=Allan|date=July 5, 1983|page=9B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boise Cascade's stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, then fell to $15 in the fall of 1971.&lt;ref name=bctrtobel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f-0vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7169%2C4934683 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=''(Los Angeles Times)'' |last=Lawrence |first=John |title=Boise Cascade belatedly tries to re-shape image |date=June 11, 1972 |page=12S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After nine years, he left Boise in late May 1972,&lt;ref name=bdxnnoff&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6dYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5259%2C4790819 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |agency=Associated Press |title=Bendix names new officers |date=May 30, 1972 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stock price was around $14.&lt;ref name=nyse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m5lRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cxEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2851%2C5102342 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |title=New York Stock Exchange Transactions |agency=Associated Press |date=May 31, 1972|page=10, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bendix==
Agee joined [[Bendix Corporation]], an automobile industry related manufacturer located near [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in May 1972.&lt;ref name=artttwm/&gt; He had been recruited for the post by Bendix's then-CEO, [[W. Michael Blumenthal|Michael Blumenthal]]. Agee became CFO and Executive Vice President,&lt;ref name=bdxnnoff/&gt; and held a seat on the Board of Directors. He was elected President of the company in December 1976 at the age of 38,&lt;ref name=bltkp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=is8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3883,1185274 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|last=Ruskin|first=Judith|agency=Associated Press|title=Bendix leader to keep policy|date=December 20, 1976|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elevated to CEO a few weeks later when Blumenthal left Bendix to become the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] in the new Carter Administration.

Agee was recognized in ''Time'' magazine &lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953339-1,00.html "Just Friends,"] ''Time,'' February 8, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; for his strategy of bold, selective acquisitions aimed at transforming Bendix from a slow-growth manufacturing company in a mature industry, into a diversified high-tech corporation. Agee's strategy dramatically increased the stock value of Bendix during Agee's tenure despite a recession that afflicted two of its traditionally main businesses, automobile parts and machine tools. While competitors floundered in 1981, Bendix' profits increased 136% and its fiscal year revenues rose to $4.4 billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"/&gt;

Agee was an unorthodox executive for the 1970s, often dressing in [[business casual]] attire years before it was in vogue. He removed the traditional boardroom table, replacing it with large, comfortable chairs to improve communication.&lt;ref&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954585,00.html "Business: Bendix Abuzz,"] ''Time'', October 6, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He abolished reserved parking for top executives, allowing the best parking spots to go to employees who arrived at the office the earliest.

He was known for promoting young employees based upon merit rather than seniority. This practice caused a flurry of media interest in 1980 when he promoted 28-year-old Mary Cunningham, who had been his executive assistant, to the position of vice president for corporate communications and then VP for Strategic Planning.&lt;ref name="amazon1984"&gt;Mary Cunnningham Agee. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671475630 Powerplay – What Really Happened at Bendix], Simon Schuster 1984, {{ISBN|0-671-47563-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A nationally publicized account of an alleged office romance between Agee and Cunningham – which both denied – led to Cunningham’s resignation in October 1980 when she felt she could no longer effectively do her job.&lt;ref name="amazon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="takeover"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Skow|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083977,00.html |title=The Takeover Didn't Take, but Bill Agee and Mary Cunningham Made One Merger That Works |publisher=People|date=December 27, 1982|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Agee and Cunningham divorced their spouses and married in June 1982.&lt;ref name="takeover"/&gt;

Agee sought to expand Bendix by launching a takeover bid for rival [[Martin Marietta]]. On August 25, 1982, Bendix announced it had purchased 1.6 million shares of Martin Marietta for $40 million. Martin Marietta fought the [[Hostile takeover#Hostile takeovers|hostile takeover]]&lt;!--Comment: "hostile" is not POV language, it's part of a recognized, common term--&gt; by attempting to acquire Bendix, employing the [[Pac-Man defense]], in which a company that is threatened with a takeover, attempts to turn the tables by acquiring its would-be buyer. At one point, Bendix owned a majority of Martin Marietta shares, while Martin Marietta, in turn owned a majority of Bendix shares. Neither Agee nor Marietta President Thomas Pownall would concede defeat, with Pownall refusing even to meet with Agee. When Marietta enlisted the help of a third company, [[United Technologies Corporation|United Technologies]], Agee sought a partner to fend off the threatened takeover of Bendix. Agee eventually found Edward Hennessy of [[Allied Corporation|Allied Corp.]], who offered a way out of the stand-off: Allied would take possession of Marietta's shares of Bendix in exchange for the return of Bendix's Marietta holdings. In effect, Martin Marietta would remain an independent company while Bendix would become a [[subsidiary]] of Allied. Agee resigned from Bendix following the merger.&lt;ref&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950790,00.html "High Noon: Showdown Time for Bendix"],''Time'', September 20, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aqpaba&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gW8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6618,4946892|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|agency=''(Los Angeles Times)''|title=Agee quits post at Bendix, Allied|date=February 9, 1983|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morrison Knudsen==
From 1988 to 1995 Agee was Chairman, President and CEO of the construction company, Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MK) in his hometown of Boise.&lt;ref name=mknaceoch88&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fOhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=puEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5406%2C1191736

Agee thwarted the takeover and returned the failing Morrison Knudsen to profitability within one year.&lt;ref name="the wreck"&gt;Time staff reporter. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982764,00.html "The Wreck of Morrison Knudsen"], ''Time'', April 3, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, Agee had made the company highly profitable and it was debt-free.&lt;ref name="the wreck"/&gt;  Agee employed a diversification strategy which changed the company from one which was primarily reliant on heavy construction to one which was involved in railroad remanufacturing, precious minerals, and the transit business.&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/obituary-william-agee-business-exec-who-led-morrison-knudsen-to-bankruptcy/|title=William Agee, Business Exec.

He moved out of company headquarters in Boise to run the enterprise from his home in Pebble Beach. MK had record profits between 1989 and 1991, much of which derived from operating revenue, accounting decisions, and non-traditional sources of income such as investments.&lt;ref name="exile"/&gt; When the rail business disintegrated after the loss of several contracts, MK found itself unable to return to its core businesses.&lt;ref name="the wreck"/&gt;

In February 1995, when MK announced a loss of $310 million for fiscal year 1994, the MK board voted to terminate Agee.&lt;ref name=msdisas/&gt; A leak of an intended Agee resignation drew broad media attention which resulted in Agee resigning earlier than originally planned.&lt;ref name="exile"/&gt;&lt;ref name=aoustabc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wF1IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YQMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3059%2C2861125 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |agency=Associated Press |title=Agee ousted; all Boise celebrates |date=February 11, 1995 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=textaf&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=990vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DP0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4807,252022 |last=Wollenberg |first=Skip |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Ledger |location=[[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland, FL]] |title=Top exec takes a fall |date=February 11, 1985 |page=1E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msdisas&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-pVQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4250%2C1344139 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Sloan |first=Allan |agency=Newsday |title=Master of disaster sinks yet another corporation |date=February 6, 1995 |page=19D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msofdstr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-pVQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4250%2C1344139 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Newsday |last=Sloan |first=Allan |title=Master of disaster sinks yet another corporation |date=February 6, 1995 |page=19D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Yoga piracy''' refers to the practice of claiming [[copyright]]s on [[yoga]] postures and techniques found in ancient treatises indigenous to [[India]]. The ongoing debate centers on those who profit by creating legally proprietary systems of yoga in countries other than India using information generally felt by Indians to be within the [[public domain]], if not proprietary traditional knowledge. Cases of Yoga Piracy often center on fitness instructors of non-Indian origin who claim copyrights on [[asana]]s (yoga poses), [[pranayama]] techniques and sequences, and [[ayurvedic]] medicine&lt;ref name="story1"&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=159889 Pune’s gurus get into the act to curb West’s yoga piracy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309070314/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=159889 |date=March 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their home countries, the most notable example being the case of [[copyright claims on Bikram Yoga]] in the [[United States]]. This has become a lucrative international industry, with some estimates for the yoga fitness industry in the United States as high as $3 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] annually.&lt;ref name="story2"&gt;[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14045678 Westerners think twice before patenting yoga poses! - Sify.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[Government of India]] has initiated the documentation of 1,500 yoga asana or postures &lt;ref name="story1" /&gt; - from the ancient [[Yoga Sutras]] of [[Patanjali]] to present times - and is storing them in the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] to be made available to [[patent office]]s worldwide. {{As of|2005}}, one-third of the estimated 30 million database pages have been compiled by the Indian [[Ministry of Commerce (India)|Commerce Ministry]].&lt;ref name="story2" /&gt; Fifteen of the most prominent yoga schools in India are involved, including the [[Iyengar Institute]] and [[Kaivalyadham]], run by Nitin Unkule.&lt;ref name="story1" /&gt;
