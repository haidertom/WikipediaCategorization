On display in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], in the African Art and Indian Art of the Americas, is a 19th-century [[drinking horn]]. Originally from the [[Kuba Kingdom]], the drinking horn is made out of wood, iron, and copper alloy. Drinking horns were usually a gift to the friends and family of kings or given to a warrior.

== History ==

=== Kuba Kingdom ===
{{main|Kuba Kingdom}}
[[File:Democratic Republic of Congo.png|thumb|Highlights where Congo is]]

The Kuba Kingdom, founded in the 17th century, is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It held nine provinces and chiefdoms were a part of that society.&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of Culture and Institutions: Evidence from the Kuba Kingdom, http://econ.columbia.edu/files/econ/content/kuba_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They were surrounded by other tribes such as the [[Yaka people|Yaka]], Suku, [[Pende people|Pende]], etc. The people from the Kuba kingdom were also known as the Bakuba.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; They were skilled at hunting, farming, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba background, http://kubaafricanart.weebly.com/background.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more important aspects of the Kuba kingdom was their religion. They were heavily based on the spirits of mother earth and those of their past kings.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to their religious ceremonies, the way someone was buried depended on the items placed in the coffin. For the wealthy, they had several items such as delicate figurines, masks, and drinking cups placed in their coffin.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; The detail and quality of the items told where they were in the social hierarchy.

== 19th Century Drinking Horn ==

=== Object History ===

The Kuba kingdom was located in what is known today as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The kingdom was known for their supernatural powers and spiritual beliefs. Like many kingdoms, royalty was one of the most important parts. Besides having one ruler, they had 19 other rulers underneath the king that managed the 19 groups in Kuba. One of the many ways that these kings showed their status and power was by the amount of money they spent. When it comes to drinking horns, kings would give them out to their family and friends to show their wealth and generosity. 
Drinking horns were one of the many objects that showed class. The more elegant and intrinsic the design, the higher in society they were.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolot, Alexander. "Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Kuba Kingdom, The Metropolitan Museum of Art."http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kuba/hd_kuba.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The patterns and material made for the drinking horn was an important aspect to show status. Drinking horns were typically used to drink palm wine. The intake of this beverage is an example of something that was done with events held by the king. This may also be an event in which the king shows his generosity and hands out gifts. 
The drinking horn is in the shape of a buffalo horn that symbolizes the status of the warrior that received it. The design of the horn includes patterns that are in a geometrical shape, a crocodile, and a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; This specific drinking horn has an attachment made out of iron that can be attached to a belt that the warrior would wear. The fact that the drinking horn has this accessory and option to be attached to a belt shows a high level of status within not only the Kuba society, but also the warrior community.

=== Ownership History ===

This specific drinking horn was first owned by object collector, Raoul Blondiau. He was a collector and diplomat who was based in Brussels. Blondiau is a well-known collector that is mentioned several times in many different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;The Blondiau-Theatre Arts Collection and the Harlem Renaissance, http://metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/african-art/blondiau-harlem-renaissance&lt;/ref&gt; Blondiau then sold the drinking horn to the [[Theatre Arts Monthly]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the Harlem Museum of African Art Travelling Exhibit at that time. During the ownership of the Theater Arts Monthly, it was lent to the Chicago Children’s Museum for Negro in Art Week. It was lent during the month of December. Being a part of a traveling exhibit, the object moved around. At one point, it was lent to the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York.
In the Art Institute of Chicago’s website, it is said to have been gifted to the museum by G. F. Harding in 1928. No information has been found concerning G. F. Harding.

==History==
Now in a poor state, the painting was admired by [[Vasari]] in [[Reggio Emilia]] - he described it as:
{{quote|a small painting one foot tall, the rarest and most beautiful thing, in which can be seen his small figures and Christ in the garden - the painting is set at night, with the angel appearing and by the light of his splendor illuminating Christ, who is shown so real and so true that it is impossible to imagine him being expressed better. At the foot of the mountain, on level ground, are three sleeping apostles, above whom he shows Christ praying, which gives an impossible strength to the figures; and even more so, in the background, he shows dawn rising and soldiers coming with Judas from one side of the painting: and in such smallness and with such intensity does he show this story, there is no work that is its parallel for patience and hard work.}}
This is supported by [[:File:Bernardino Curti, orazione nell'orto, da Correggio.jpg|a contemporary print of the work by Bernardino Curti]] and a 17th-18th century copy now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]].&lt;ref name="nationalgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/after-correggio-the-agony-in-the-garden|title=After Correggio &amp;#124; The Agony in the Garden &amp;#124; NG76|website=National Gallery, London|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was still in Reggio Emilia in the 1580s, in the collection of Rodolfo Signoretti, where it was studied by [[Lelio Orsi]] (who copied from it in ''Christ among the crosses''), [[Titian]], [[Lomazzo]], [[El Greco]] and [[Annibale Carracci]]. A 1582 source reported that "news [of the work had circulated] in Spain and in Rome" and that [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Alfonso II d'Este]] had both tried in vain to buy it. The Milanese nobleman Pirro Visconti succeeded in buying it around 1587 and brought it to his villa at [[Lainate]] in [[Milan]], where it found favour as part of the deeply religious era of [[St Charles Borromeo]], who kept a copy of it in the room where he died. It was also copied by [[Giulio Campi]] in a painting now in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. From the [[house of Visconti]] it passed to the [[Marquis of Caracena]] before being taken to Spain by the end of the 17th century - there it was admired by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] before being acquired by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] during the [[Peninsular War]].

[[File:Jan van Kessel - Air.jpg|thumb|''Air'', oil on copper, c. 1647, 76.2 × 99.1 cm]]

'''''Air''''' is a painting created by [[Flemish]] painter [[Jan van Kessel, senior|Jan van Kessel]] (1626–1679) and was painted around the year 1647. It is a part of the permanent collection at the [[Flint Institute of Arts]].

The [[Classical elements|four elements]] – earth, air, fire and water – were popular subjects with 17th century painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Val A. Browning Collection: A Selection of Old Master Paintings | author=Ed. Sheila D. Muller | publisher=The Utah Museum of Fine Arts, University of Utah |year=1958| location=Salt Lake City  |oclc=48406944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, air is represented by a wide variety of creatures of flight, mythological figures and atmospheric conditions. A multitude of birds, including peacocks, turkeys, parrots, owls and an ostrich are shown in the painting. Several bats also appear in the painting, including one in the upper right that devours a bird while in flight. In the center of the painting, Apollo drives his chariot across the sky. Beneath him, [[Urania]], the Muse of Astronomy, sits on a cloud, and in her left hand she holds an [[armillary sphere]]. Another of her attributes, the compass, appears on the ground next to her along with an [[astrolabe]], a [[Quadrant (astronomy)|quadrant]], and a [[Jacob's staff|cross staff]], which are all instruments used for measuring the position of the planets and stars. All of this takes place in a landscape characterized by a dark, stormy sky on the left, complete with a bolt of lightning. On the right, the sky brightens over a vast expanse of trees and mountains.

The composition can be traced back to a prototype developed by van Kessel's grandfather, [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel I]]. Like his uncle, [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|Jan Brueghel II]], and other members of his family, van Kessel continued Jan I's work. In fact, the tradition of copying the elder Brueghel's composition continued into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abcgallery.com/B/bruegel/janbio.html Jan Brueghel the Elder]".

Made of banded [[slate]], a material frequently used in bannerstone manufacture. Bannerstones were used in North America for some 3,000 years beginning in the fourth millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1979.206.403 Bannerstone] at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Bannerstones''' are [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s usually found in the Eastern [[United States]] that are characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone. The holes are typically ¼" to ¾" in diameter and extend through a raised portion centered in the stone. They usually are bored all the way through but some have been found with holes that extend only part of the way through. Many are made from banded slate or other colored hard stone. They often have a geometric "wing nut" or "butterfly" shape but are not limited to these. More than just functional artifacts, bannerstones are a form of art that appear in varying shapes, designs, and colors, symbolizing their ceremonial and spiritual importance.

==Debates over function==
[[Archaeologists]] have debated over the use of banner stones. Some have suggested  that they are [[atlatl]] weights or ceremonial pieces. Others have suggested that they are for drilling, cordage making, or fire making. [[Robert S. Berg]]'s theory proposed that they are part of a kit of tools used to make and repair atlatl darts. Berg's theory has met with a lot of skepticism and resistance because of the previous works of William S. Webb, who proposed that the bannerstone was actually part of an atlatl. Webb cited "in situ" evidence which consisted mainly of bannerstones found in line with atlatl handles and hooks in graves that archaeologists dug up during the construction of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s massive water control system in the southeast during the early part of the 20th century. It seems that "their primary value lay in their symbolic and aesthetic worth rather than in their tool-like efficiency" &lt;ref&gt;(Berg, 1998:75)&lt;/ref&gt; because of the manner in which they were created and later found in archaeological sites.

The ceremonial importance of bannerstones is related to "the psychological uncertainties and physical dangers of daily life among early hunters and gatherers".&lt;ref&gt;(Hero, 2004: 22)&lt;/ref&gt; These peoples appealed to the powers of the stone, their creator(s)/deities, and the natural entities around them for protection and survival in the harsh life of the Archaic Period. Being killed in the hunt is one danger that they would be trying to protect themselves from, while giving thanks and recognizing the powers guiding their spears thrown from the atlatls would ensure their success in the hunt. As stated in ''Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand: American Indian Art of the Ancient Midwest and South'', "[bannerstones'] craftsmanship and materials suggest that they also served as emblems of prestige and status conferred upon hunters coming of age, and as supernatural talismans for increasing the spear-throwers efficacy. They may also have served as emblems of clans or other social units".&lt;ref&gt;(2004:26)&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because it shows the bannerstone going beyond simple function in the hunt to complex symbolic function in various aspects of society.

==History and context==
Bannerstones, as part of a larger picture, indicate that the societies in which they were a part had greater social organization than those in the past. They also indicate a greater interdependence among tribes of various regions. Brian M. Fagan states that, "the production of elaborate and labor-intensive bannerstones (atlatl weights) and stone vessels makes little sense at a local level, but when produced as objects used in broad exchange networks tied to cooperative alliances, such artifacts have considerable value." This is because, as he further states, "many of the important technological innovations of the Archaic resulted from just such successful alliances which made life more secure in an unpredictable environment of patchy food resources".&lt;ref&gt;(2005:379)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bannerstones can be seen as indicators of ties between societies in the form of trade, whether it is for the stone that the bannerstone is made out of, the region where the finished bannerstone is found, or the way that it is designed. "Innovations" speak of new ideas entering already existing societies and merging with pre-existing beliefs, resulting in artifacts and art forms such as bannerstones.

Fagan also states, that "from the Mid Archaic onward, people invested more labor in fashioning socially valued artifacts and ornaments like finely ground 'bannerstones'"&lt;ref&gt;(2005:416)&lt;/ref&gt; to be used in the networks of trade and formation of "alliances." Bannerstones were created for more than just strict physical survival; they were created for spiritual survival and wellbeing as a part of a cosmological system of belief that both varied between groups of archaic peoples and connected them in the Eastern Woodlands.

The Laurentian is a period of time in the Late Archaic (c. 3200 to c. 1000 BC) that describes the region from New England to Quebec, down into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Archaic peoples of this region and time period are one example of a group that produced "polished bannerstones".&lt;ref&gt;(Fagan, 2005:406)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannerstones eventually went out of use as new technologies were invented and spread by trade routes. This includes the bow and arrow which appeared around or before 500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;(Fagan, 2005: 133)&lt;/ref&gt; While the bannerstones themselves went out of use, the ceremonial and spiritual importance of these objects did not, being transferred to the new objects that replaced them.

==Notable finds==

An important archaic site containing numerous graves containing bannerstones is at Indian Knoll, Kentucky. At this site, "few of the bannerstones show signs of use. [. . .] They are carved of exotic imported stones with an exceptional artistry that exploits the natural colours, patterns, and striations of the stones to afford maximum visual satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;(Berlo et al., 1998:75)&lt;/ref&gt; This shows both the importance of long distance trade in connecting various archaic societies as well as the importance they placed on the visual appeal of the pieces. This visual appeal would be created in part to please the spirits that the individuals were attempting to persuade for assistance and protection in the hunt, society, and the world as a whole.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour''' (in [[French language|French]]: La Société Canadienne de Peintres en Aquarelle), founded in 1925 is considered to be [[Canada]]'s official national [[Watercolor painting|water colour]] Society. Since the 1980s the Society has enjoyed [[Vice-regal]] [[Patronage]] from the incumbent [[Governor-General of Canada]]. Recognized by a long list of international exhibitions it is the Canadian equivalent of such other national societies as the [[American Watercolor Society]] of the United States, the [[Royal Watercolour Society]] of the United Kingdom, etc.
 
The nation's oldest [[Artistic medium|medium]]-specific arts organization has had an illustrious history. Membership is looked upon as a mark of achieving peer recognition in one of the most difficult and demanding visual arts form.

The elected members are entitled to use the Society's initials '''CSPWC''' (in French: '''SCPA''') after their names.

== Early history ==
There is probably justification for including some of the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] peoples as early users of versions of [[watercolour]] in their artwork and crafts. Using local materials and chemicals they certainly approximated the watercolour medium in some of their [[pigments]] and [[dyes]] while really not having any practical reason for exploring any inherent transparent qualities.

The first recorded use of a [[Europe]]an trained watercolourist working within what is today [[Canada|Canadian]] territory is believed to be the works of John White&lt;ref&gt;"A Pageant of Canada (an Exhibition arranged in celebration of the Centenary of the Confederation)" Pages 8-11, 1967 Catalogue by (Sir) Roy Strong. The National Gallery of Canada Publication. Roger Duhamel, Queen's Printer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Canadian Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt; who accompanied the expeditions of [[Sir Martin Frobisher]]&lt;ref&gt;"Landmarks of Canadian Art" By Peter Mellen. Publisher: McClelland and Stewart Ltd., Toronto 1978, Page 23. {{ISBN|0-7710-5828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1570s. Another early example of a gifted watercolourist working in the same region would be [[Samuel de Champlain]]&lt;ref&gt;"Champlain`s Dream" David Hackett Fischer. Published by Alfred A. Knoph Canada. {{ISBN|978-0-307-39766-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who first arrived in 1603. Historically art-trained officers or [[cartographers]] were dispatched by both the [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] governments to assist in the preparation of vitally important maps of these newly claimed lands and to record geographical features.&lt;ref&gt;"The Painter in the New World (A survey of painting since 1564 to 1867, marking the founding of Canadian Confederation)" Catalogue for June 9 - July 30, 1967 Exhibition organized for the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts / Le Musée des Beaux - Arts de Montreal. Designed by Robert R. Reed, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; There is a surviving wealth of early watercolours from this period which record landscape features and early settlements. Eagerly collected in today's art markets the best are notably housed in [[Library and Archives Canada]], the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].

Prior to the invention of the [[camera]], watercolour [[portrait miniatures]], on vellum or ivory, were a staple in the homes of Canada's urban elite.

By the nineteenth century there were a number of well known watercolourists such as [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]] [1737-1812],&lt;ref name="The Ontario Community Collects 1975. Page 68"&gt;"The Ontario Community Collects (A survey of Canadian Painting, 1766 to the present)" By William C. Forsey. Publisher: Art Gallery of Ontario, Catalogue 1975. Page 68 and pages 88-91. {{ISBN|0-919876-12-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Heriot  [1766-1844],&lt;ref name="The Ontario Community Collects 1975. Page 68"/&gt; Otto Jacobi [1812-1901], Charles Jones Way [1824-1919] and Canadian-born [[Lucius Richard O'Brien]] [1832-1899] working in various parts of the country. Kane became well known for his record of interactions with the [[First Nations]] People as he travelled across western [[Canada]] with [[The North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. While Jacobi, Way and O'Brien and others involved themselves in the 1880 founding of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] there had long been demands, especially in [[Montreal]], for the formation of a specifically medium based society.

While several of these early societies did survive for brief periods it was on November 11, 1925, that a group of like-minded artists met at the historic [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts &amp; Letters Club of Toronto]] and founded the CSPWC/SCPA. Only when a working framework was proposed for membership under the honorary leadership of the noted painter R.F. Gagen did it seem possible that such a society could survive in the immense [[geographical]] reality that was Canada. Within a few years a set of [[bylaws]] had been established, a [[constitution]] approved and several [[Toronto]]-based exhibitions held. The first elected President was Fred H. Brigden (1871–1951) a well-connected artist and educator who created a sense of vitality within the group and who encouraged many younger artists to apply for election.

Greene, Robert Holmes, Franz Johnston, André Lapine, and E.J.Sampson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

When organizing the initial meeting these mainly Ontario-based artists did invite a number of nationally prominent watercolourists including W.J. Phillips&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and F.H. McGillivray&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; who, being based at distances from Toronto, were unable to attend. However they did send strong letters of support and in reality should be considered "founders". This is significant because the inclusion of Florence H. McGillivray&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; is evidence of the new society's willingness to accept [[female]] members from its inception.

== Formative years ==
The CSPWC/SCPA,&lt;ref&gt;"Passionate Spirits (History of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1880-1980)", Page 162. Rebecca Sisler RCA, Clarke Irwin Co. Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7720-1308-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting attention in its infancy, was soon having its exhibitions hung at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]) and the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. This emphasis on exhibitions was crucial at the time as there were virtually no commercial galleries in the country. The only way an individual artist could make a living was by exhibiting with such societies as the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], and the [[Royal Canadian Academy]], in a public gallery. The reality was that the emerging artist got public recognition by jury acceptance to exhibit with his or her better-known peer group, their fame adding lustre by association.

In the years between the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], [[Canada]] experienced a period of unexpected growth as demand for its agricultural products and mineral wealth made it one of the world's strongest markets. As one of the signatories of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, Canada was, unknown to itself at the time, seeking to establish its own identity separate from its earlier colonial rulers.

[[File:WorldsFair1939.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Catalogue cover.|The 1939 New York World's Fair catalogue cover.]]

It was in the visual arts, initially in the area of landscape painting, that the new country found one of its strongest senses of self. As painters across the country fanned out into their respective rural, backwood and northern spaces, it was the medium of watercolour an easily transportable and light material which lent itself so readily to the newly popular subject matter.

While many artists did use watercolours as an on-site [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] medium, many used those same paintings as source material for often larger and more highly finished works on [[canvas]] that they produced in their home studios. The resulting public perception of watercolours as a lesser medium than others such as oil is a still recurrent problem for all practitioners despite the fact that watercolour is the more demanding medium. It was this very ill-informed perception that was behind the very founding of the Society as an exhibiting body where the individual art pieces would not be compared to neighbouring work in other less challenging materials.

Beginning in the 1930s, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] was instrumental in assisting the CSPWC/SCPA with a series of high-profile international exchange exhibitions with societies in [[New Zealand]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[US]]. In addition, the National Gallery from 1933 onward sponsored a regular series of juried shows that toured across Canada. The Federal Government invited the CSPWC/SCPA to exhibit in the Canadian Pavilion at the 1938 [[British Empire Exhibition]] and at the 1939 New York [[World's Fair]]. Both of these overseas exhibitions were praised by the international art press and served to increase the prestige of the Society.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]]  a number of members were appointed official [[war artists]] and served in various capacities at home and on the war fronts. The regular series of exhibitions was obviously affected and only fully resumed in 1946.

== Times change ==
In 1949, the Society's annual exhibition at the [[Art Gallery of Toronto]] was reorganized to open up new rules to become the first truly "open", as opposed to "invitational", show in the Society's history. That tradition, with some amendments, has continued to the present day with the current "Open Water" Annual Exhibition being open internationally to any artist working in the medium.
 
The 1950s witnessed the creation of new areas of art scholarship with the development of both commercial art galleries and a new professional approach to art curatorships in the major public galleries. Finding that a sizeable percentage of the exhibition programme was taken up with the annual shows of regional and national arts groups, the new curatorial staff repositioned themselves. The last regular exhibition of the Society at the Art Gallery of Toronto was hosted in 1958 and subsequently there was a cooling of long treasured connections with [[National Gallery of Canada|Ottawa's National Gallery]].
 
The leadership within the CSPWC/SCPA sought alternate gallery space and found it in a variety of venues from coast to coast. Regional galleries, libraries and university campuses hosted the annual exhibitions and a new sense of national identity was found within the Society. While the annual search for a venue created much work for a volunteer membership it did help develop a real sense of comradeship that has continued to the present day. While a number of other media-based institutions started to falter during this difficult period the CSPWC/SCPA worked very hard to keep itself viable and the annual juried show its "[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]". Working from within its own resources and relying on elected members in far-flung communities, the regular annual exhibitions continued to take place but the cost of shipping, cataloguing and insurance were prohibitive and much of the work was performed by a small set of volunteers. It all became very draining, and as new commercial galleries sprung up, many members left to forge more lucrative connections.

== Rebounding ==
The long history of annual juried exhibitions continued into the 1970s and with the addition of exchange exhibitions with the [[American Watercolor Society]] at the National Academy Galleries in [[New York City]]. In 1975, an invitation was accepted to exhibit at the newly renovated [[Canada House]] on [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. The same year the Art Gallery of Ontario hosted an "in-house" retrospective to salute the Society's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;"FIFTY YEARS, The Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, 1925-1975". 1975 Catalogue, Art Gallery of Ontario. Katharine A. Jordan. {{ISBN|0-919876-08-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the Society was able to organize a member exchange exhibition with [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;"Watercolours Japan - Canada [An exhibition sponsored by CSPWC/SCPA and the Japanese Water Colour Society]" 1976 Catalogue, Foreword by John Bennett. Design by [[William Rueter]], Printer: The Coach House Press, Toronto. A Wintario Project.&lt;/ref&gt; that was exhibited at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]]. This particular show, with the cooperation of a number of government and commercial partners was a critical success. The acclaim received gave the CSPWC/SCPA members a renewed sense of identity.
 
Working with Visual Arts Ontario,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; the Society was able to obtain permanent office space in the 1970s and was able to organize the first of a number of educational seminars that have evolved into today's popular National Watercolour Symposiums. These week-long events have been held in virtually every part of the country and have been responsible for a major spurt in applications for membership.
 
When the time came to organize the CSPWC/SCPA 1985 [[Diamond Jubilee]] the Society found that the world of art had again gone through some major changes. First there was a burst of new interest in the whole field of painting in watercolour that was particularly evident in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. There was also a realization in the art community that while there were many advantages to be found in the commercial galleries there were still other opportunities that could only be found in the context of the traditional societies. This was strongly reinforced when [[HM Queen Elizabeth II|H.M. The Queen]] accepted the 60 paintings that had been juried as the "CSPWC Diamond Jubilee Collection" (later known as the [[Royal Collection Project - CSPWC]], phase 1) into the fabled [[Royal Collection]] at [[Windsor Castle]] and exhibited them in 1986 in the Castle's Drawing Gallery. Later the CSPWC/SCPA was deeply involved with a major touring exhibition "International Waters" that put Canadian paintings on exhibition with submissions from The [[Royal Watercolour Society]], The [[American Watercolor Society]], and [[The Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour]]&lt;ref&gt;"INTERNATIONAL WATERS". Seventy five selected contemporary watercolours of three countries. Touring exhibition, Canada 1991; United States of America, 1992; Great Britain, 1992-93. 1991 Catalogue. Layout and cover by Don Getz AWS.&lt;/ref&gt; in venues in four different countries.
 
In the 1980s the CSPWC/SCPA was one of a number of major arts organizations that set up the John B. Aird Gallery/Galerie John B. Aird within the [[Ontario]] Government administrative complex at Queen's Park, [[Toronto]]. The Aird Gallery, available to each of the societies for an annual exhibition, put the CSPWC/SCPA on a secure exhibition footing and yet still gave it the opportunity to seek exhibition opportunities across the nation. When their regular exhibition slot is not used for the Annual "Open Water" show it is devoted to member themed displays.

By the 1990s the CSPWC/SCPA had truly become a "national" society with a series of regional directors and members drawn from across the country. This continues today with the current outreach to involve greater participation from [[First Nation]] artists.
 
Celebrating the 75th anniversary in 2000 with its regular Annual "Open Water" exhibition, the CSPWC/SCPA unveiled the first Julius Griffith award given to "an elected member who has made an outstanding and sustained contribution to the Society". Once again adjudication of members' works took place in order to send another 15 paintings to be added to the 60 Canadian holdings at the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]] at [[Windsor Castle]] to become a part of the CSPWC's Royal Collection Project. Those selected were displayed at the [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts &amp; Letters Club of Toronto]] and then at the [[Canadian High Commission]] in [[London]] where they were, in 2001, formally accepted by H.R.H. the [[Prince of Wales]] who is an Honorary Member of the CSPWC/SCPA.

There was also a members' exhibition in Toronto that marked the anniversary thereby continuing a long tradition. As the year came to a close, a major retrospective show of the Society, "A Brush with History", was organized by the Art Gallery of [[Mississauga]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Brush with History [The 75th Anniversary Exhibition of The Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour]". 2000 Catalogue. Art Gallery of Mississauga. Stuart Reid (Curator and Director) and Lucia Cecco (Gallery Assistant).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present ==

The Annual "Open Water" show, open to all artists, continues to be the focus of the Society's work, which can be hosted anywhere in the country. The most prestigious award is the "[[A. J. Casson Award]]", a commissioned medal created by the distinguished Canadian sculptor [[Dora de Pédery-Hunt]], given "for outstanding achievement in watercolour painting" to the best work in the show. The medal is accompanied by a cash award. While these shows generate a number of sponsor-based awards the only other award actually funded by the Society is the "[[Charles Comfort]] Medal"&lt;ref name="landmarks"&gt;"Landmarks of Canadian Art". By Peter Mellen, publisher McClelland and Stewart Ltd, Toronto. Pages 195-197. {{ISBN|0-7710-5828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; given for an outstanding figurative work.

In January 2008, the CSPWC/SCPA hosted an exhibition at the John B. Aird Gallery/Galerie John B. Aird which honoured the careers of ten outstanding Life Members. Titled "Treasures", this show was the best attended Aird Gallery exhibition in decades. The next year saw another ten Life Members honoured in "Treasures 2009".
 
The Society is a regular contributor to annual exhibitions at the Museo Nacional de le Acuarela in [[Mexico]].

The Society has a long history of encouraging younger artists and continues to sponsor awards at the [[NSCAD University]] ([[Arthur Lismer]] Award), The [[Ontario College of Art &amp; Design]] (Fred Brigden Award), and the [[Alberta College of Art and Design]] (June Montgomery Award).

Since the 1980s each member upon election is required to donate a significant and typical work to the Society's Diploma Collection currently housed in the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]]. This valuable resource which also includes earlier works by members is often referred to as the National Watercolour Collection. It is available as an exhibition and study resource, and part of the collection is exhibited on a regular basis.

The '''''Cardinal and Theological Virtues''''' is a [[lunette]] fresco by [[Raphael]] found on the south wall of the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Three of the [[cardinal virtues]] are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the [[theological virtues]] are depicted by [[putto|putti]]. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of [[Pope Julius II]]. These rooms are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]. After completing his three monumental frescoes ''[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament]]'', ''[[The Parnassus]]'', and ''[[The School of Athens]]'' in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the ''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' in 1511.{{sfn|Knight|1847|p=358}}

==Description==
[[File:Raffael 053.jpg|thumb|left|Justice displayed in a medallion on the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura]]
The walls containing frescoes in the ''Stanza della Segnatura'' depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (''School of Athens''), Religion (''Disputation''), Poetry (''Parnassus''), and Law (''Virtues'').{{sfn|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=409}} The fourth wall containing the ''Virtues'' addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}} Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues ([[courage|Fortitude]], [[Prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]) are  attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Faith in Christianity#Roman Catholicism|Faith]].{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

On the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the [[Della Rovere]] family to which Pope Julius II belonged.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}} Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a [[modello]] Raphael had seen of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].{{sfn|Joannides|1983|p=20}}

Prominently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged [[Gorgon]] to ward off deceit and fraud. [[Janus]]-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

Temperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

The fourth cardinal virtue, [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] on the ceiling directly above the fresco.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=71}} The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis [[Plato]] placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.{{sfn|Jacorzynski|2009|p=193}}

The other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the [[Emperor Justinian]] receiving the civil code known as the [[Digest (Roman law)|Pandects]] of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' from [[Tribonian]]. To the right of the window, [[Pope Gregory IX]] (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the ''[[Decretales Gregorii IX|Decretals]]'' from [[Raymond of Penyafort]].{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}}

'''''Carol Symphony''''' is a collection of four preludes, written by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] in 1927.

==History==
It had its first performance on 26 September 1929 at a [[promenade concert]] at the [[Queen's Hall]] which was broadcast live on the BBC's [[2LO]], with other music by [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Percy Pitt]]. It was conducted by the composer.

==Structure==
It is based on four [[Christmas carol]]s, given additional orchestration and [[counterpoint]] arrangements. The four movements are written to be played uninterrupted consecutively.

===Movements===
* The first movement (Allegro energico) is based on ''[[O Come All Ye Faithful]]''. It is in the style of a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] [[chorale prelude]].
* The second movement is a scherzo (Allegro molto moderato) on ''[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]'', similar to the Russian [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]] compositions.
* The third movement (Andante quasi lento e cantabile) is a slow movement whose outer sections are based on the [[Coventry Carol]], with a central interlude on ''[[The First Nowell]]''.
* The finale (Allegro energico come prima) recapitulates material from the first movement, and also uses ''[[Here We Come A-Wassailing]]'' before concluding with a re-statement of ''[[O Come All Ye Faithful]]'' similar to a style of [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] in a [[Fugue|fugal]] structure.

==Usage for theme music==
Two sections from the ''First Nowell'' section were used for the 1943 [[Children's Hour]] adaptation of [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Box of Delights]]''. The work was later used as the opening and closing titles of the [[The Box of Delights (TV series)|1984 BBC Television adaptation]] of the same novel. It featured a recording conducted by [[Barry Rose]] in 1966 of the [[Pro Arte Orchestra]] at [[Guildford Cathedral]]. During [[World War II]], the book had been adapted for radio on the BBC's ''[[Children's Hour]]'', and Hely-Hutchinson's same music had been used. Prof Hely-Hutchinson later became the BBC's Director of Music, in 1944, until his death in 1947.

During the 1940-50s, the first movement was used to assist tuning into the [[BBC]]'s Home Service station before the start of the morning transmission during the Christmas period.

==Recordings==
* Metropole Symphony Orchestra, Dolf van der Linden (conductor) recorded by Paxton Records (LPT 1002). Reissued 2015 by [[Guild 'Light Music']] on GLCD 5233
* Pro-Arte Orchestra, Barry Rose at Guildford Cathedral recorded by [[EMI]] in 1966 (HMV Classics and EMI)

'''Chittaprosad Bhattacharya''' was a political artist of the mid-20th century. He preferred watercolor and printmaking, avoiding oil on canvas. Chittaprosad used prints to disseminate leftist ideas and propaganda.&lt;ref name=multi2&gt;''Manifestations II'', Roobina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in 1915 in [[Naihati]] in present-day [[North 24 Parganas District]], [[West Bengal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| magazine=Economic &amp; Political Weekly|date= March 5, 2016 |volume=  LI |number= 10 |first= Arup Kumar |last= Sen| title= Chittaprosad Bhattacharya (1915–78)|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chittaprosad became radicalized as a student of the Chittagong Government College in the mid-1930s. He joined the grassroots movement to resist both colonial oppression by the British, and also the feudal oppression of the landed Indian gentry. Chittaprosad rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.&lt;ref name=multi2/&gt; Due to his refusal to accept the discriminations of the caste system, Chittaprosad never used his Brahminical surname during his life.&lt;ref name=multi1&gt;''Manifestations I'', Santo Datta, Delhi Art Gallery, 2003, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote articles and produced incisive cartoons and illustrations that displayed a natural talent for draughtsmanship.&lt;ref name=multi2/&gt;

==Career and style==
Chittraprosad’s  most creative years began in the 1930s. He satirized and sharply criticized the feudal and colonial systems in quickly drawn but masterful pen and ink sketches. The artist/reformer was also proficient at creating linocuts and woodcuts with obvious propagandistic intent.&lt;ref name=multi2/&gt; Since these cheaply made prints were created for the masses rather than the art gallery, they were seldom signed or numbered. With time they took on value as art, and today are prized by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Collection of Indian Printmaking, [http://www.waswoxwaswoartcollection.blogspot.com www.waswoxwaswoartcollection.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 Chittaprosad covered the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal Famine]] for various communist publications. This resulted in his first publication, Hungry Bengal. It was a sharply provocative attack on the political and social powers of the time, and the authorities suppressed it nearly immediately, impounding and destroying large numbers.&lt;ref name=multi3&gt;''Manifestations III'', Geeta Doctor, Delhi Art Gallery, 2005, {{ISBN|81-902104-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chittaprosad settled more permanently in Bombay from 1946 onward. The transformations that the Communist Party took between 1948 and 1949 caused the artist to disassociate himself, though he continued to pursue political themes in his art to the end of his life. In the years before his death, the artist devoted more and more time to the world peace movement, and various efforts to help impoverished children.&lt;ref name=multi3/&gt;

He is represented in the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]], Prague, The [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi, Osians Art Archive, Mumbai, and the Jane and Kito de Boer Collection, Dubai.&lt;ref name=multi2/&gt;

'''Edouard Duval-Carrié''' (born 1954) is a [[Haiti]]an-born American painter and sculptor.

==Life==
Edouard Duval-Carrié was born in [[Port-au-Prince]]. His family emigrated to [[Puerto Rico]] while he was a child during the [[François Duvalier]] regime.&lt;ref name="congdon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artists from Latin American Cultures: A Biographical Dictionary|pages=74–76|author=Kristin G. Congdon and Kara Kelley Hallmark|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1oeV7vkPQIC |accessdate=2009-05-09 | isbn=978-0-313-31544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duval-Carrié studied at the [[Université de Montréal]] and [[McGill University]] in [[Canada]] before graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College, Montréal]] in 1978. He later attended the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], from 1988 to 1989.  He resided in France for many years and currently lives in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  "I didn't want to go back to Haiti because of the political turmoil there.  I have two kids," he explains.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  Instead he resides among Miami's substantial Haitian immigrant population and maintains cultural ties to his homeland.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  His works have been exhibited in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Le monde caraïbe: défis et dynamiques: p544 Christian Lerat, Université Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux III.

Duval-Carrié's art reflects the culture and history of Haiti with references to the [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] religion.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  His work is often overtly political, executed in attempts to embody his nation's spirit and its troubles with an attitude that is neither detached nor ironic.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/533.html|title= Haitian artist Edouard Duval-Carrie exhumes memories of his homeland|author= Matt Schudel|date= 22 June 2003|publisher=Miami Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1979 work ''J.C. Duvalier en Folle de Marié'' (''[[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] as Mad Bride'') is a criticism of the country's controversial leader.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  Later in ''Mardigras at [[Fort Dimanche]]'' Duval-Carrié juxtaposes Duvalier against a torture chamber, an army general, and other symbols of the repressive regime.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  [[New York University]] classified his output as [[magical realism]] for an event to accompany the book launch of ''Continental Shifts: The Art of Edouard Duval-Carrié'', which was published by the university's press.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/2000|title=’’Continental Shifts: The Art of Edouard Duval-Carrié’’ Book Launch at NYU, Mar. 27|publisher=New York University|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He operates in a variety of media: altarpieces, lacquered tiles, and reliquaries in addition to painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt;  Installations have become more prevalent in his recent output.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;

As Duval-Carrié explained his artistic motivations for a Miami art gallery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have tried to analyze the historical context of the genesis of that partial island nation [Haiti], looked at the strife and suffering that brought the then society of slaves and slave masters to the point of ebullition. I look closely at the savagery on both parts of the struggle, understanding and giving my total sympathy to the downtrodden, not realizing that patterns are easily learned and extremely resilient to alteration... I have scrutinized the successive generations of pathetic leaders and their sordid entourages...  But that is politics and an artist should be well cautioned to keep at bay that kind of poetry, which should be resumed as that of futility. So a step further or a level deeper was reached when the fabulous world of spirits, old and new, true and false, real and imagined, made themselves felt at different planes of consciousness. They come under many names, all quite entrancing. “Loas”, “Espirits”, or “Mysteres” all conveying a sense of foreboding inspiring the nebulousness from whence they come.&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/statement_duval-carrie.html |title=Artist Statement |author=Edouard Duval Carrié |publisher=Bernice Steinbaum Gallery |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217084242/http://bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/statement_duval-carrie.html |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duval-Carrié's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated [[Vodun art]] from Benin and the African Diaspora in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=33 |last=Rush|first=Dana |title=Contemporary Vodun Arts of Ouidah, Benin|journal=African Arts|volume=34|issue=4  |date=Winter 2001|publisher=UCLA James S.

Duval-Carrié received a South Florida Cultural Consortium Visual Art Fellowship in 1995 and a Southern Arts Federation Visual Art Fellowship in 1996.&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/resume_duval-carrie.html |title=Résumé |author=Edouard Duval Carrié |publisher=Bernice Steinbaum Gallery |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217083922/http://bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/resume_duval-carrie.html |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has been shown in solo exhibitions in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, France, Mexico, and in several states of the United States.&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt;  Two of the artist's works are displayed as public commissions in Miami: a 1996 piece for the Jefferson Reaves Rehabilitative and Health Center and ''The Lady of Miami'' at One Miami Riverwalk.&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt;

'''Estonian literature''' ({{lang-et|eesti kirjandus}}) is literature written in the [[Estonian language]] (c. 1,100,000 speakers) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033090/Estonian-literature Estonian literature] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The domination of [[Estonia]] after the [[Northern Crusades]], from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early written literary works in the Estonian language. The oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century. ''Originates Livoniae'' in [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The ''[[Liber Census Daniae]]'' (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.&lt;ref name="DWE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&amp;dq The Development of Written Estonian by George Kurman] {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant samples of connected Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&amp;pg Aspects of Altaic Civilization by Denis Sinor] {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known printed book is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.Wanradt and J. Koell (1535). For the use of priests an Estonian grammar was printed in German in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC&amp;pg Dictionary of Languages By Andrew Dalby; p. 182] {{ISBN|0-231-11569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Testament]] was translated into [[Võro language|southern Estonian]] in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two dialects were united by Anton Thor Helle in a form based on northern Estonian. Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840)|Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750–1840).

The cultural stratum of Estonian was originally characterised by a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity. Apart from a few albeit remarkable exceptions, this archaic form has not been much employed in later times. The most outstanding achievements in this field are the national epic [[Kalevipoeg]] (Son of Kalev), written by [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803–1882); [[Gustav Suits]]'s ballad ''Lapse sünd'' (Birth of a Child); [[Villem Grünthal-Ridala]]'s (1885–1942) poem ''Toomas ja Mai'' (Toomas and Mai) and three poems by [[August Annist]] (1899–1972). At a professional level, traditional folk song reached its new heyday during the last quarter of the 20th century, primarily thanks to the work of composer [[Veljo Tormis]].

In modern times [[Jaan Kross]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kross Jaan Kross] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaan Kaplinski]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kaplinski Jaan Kaplinski] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; remain [[Estonia]]'s best known and most translated writers.

==History of Estonian literature==
[[Image:EstonianGrammar1637.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Estonian grammar]] (1637) by Heinrich Stahl]]

===Folklore===
{{main|Estonian folklore}}
As opposed to the recent nature of written literature, the oral tradition, found in collections of Estonian folklore, tells of the ancient pre-[[Northern Crusades]] period of independence. The first fragmentary records of Estonian folk poetry, dating from the 13th century, can be found in the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]]; in the late 18th century Johann Gottfried von Herder published examples of Estonian folk songs in his anthology ''Volkslieder'' (1807). [[Jakob Hurt]] (1839–1907) was the first to start systematically collecting Estonian folklore in the second half of the 19th century,  planning a multi-volume series on Estonian folklore, called ''[[Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae]]''. Hurt coined the phrase which to this day shapes the mentality of the nation of one million people: ''If we cannot be great in number, then we must be great in spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=944 Finno-Ugric folklore and the European written word] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic Germans===
Chronicles and theatrical performances by the [[Baltic German]] nobility formed the basis for local Baltic German literature which, despite the barriers of status and language, affected Estonian literature. The earliest example of Estonian language poetry dates back to 1637, a poem written by Reiner Brockmann (1609–1647), teacher of Greek at the [[Tallinn]] Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=945 Baltic Germans at the birth of Estonian literature] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Otto Wilhelm Masing]] (1763&amp;ndash;1832) was the first literate who had a thorough mastery of the [[Estonian language]].&lt;ref name="DWE"/&gt;

===Kristjan Jaak Peterson===

''Cannot the tongue of this land''&lt;br /&gt;
''In the fire of incantation''&lt;br /&gt;
''Rising up to the heavens''&lt;br /&gt;
''Seek for eternity?''&lt;br /&gt;
:::''Kristjan Jaak Peterson''

Those lines have been interpreted as a claim to reestablish the birthright of the Estonian language. '''[[Kristjan Jaak Peterson]]''' (1801–1822) is considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. He gathered his Estonian poems into two small books but never saw them published: this only occurred a hundred years after his death (although three German poems were published posthumously in 1823). One of Peterson's projects was fulfilled in his lifetime, the German version of Kristfrid Ganander's ''Mythologia Fennica'', a dictionary of Finnish mythological words and names (the Swedish original was published in 1789). Peterson's translation of Ganander's dictionary found many readers in Estonia and abroad, becoming an important source of national ideology and inspiration for early Estonian literature. Its dominating influence extended through the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=1966 Kristian Jaak Peterson] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kalevipoeg===
[[Image:Kreutzwald-köler.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] ]]
The outstanding achievements in folklore imitate the epics: the national epic [[Kalevipoeg]] was compiled by doctors of Estonian origin: [[Friedrich Robert Faehlmann]] began the epic and it was finished by [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]]. The romantic ideology of the 19th century laid down  the requirements for a national literature. The idea of an epic was the product of a humanist circle called the [[Learned Estonian Society]] (Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft), where Faehlmann had presented his paper in 1839 on a mythical hero called Kalewipoeg (Son of Kalew). After Faehlmann's death in 1850 the society handed the manuscripts over to Kreutzwald. The first edition of "Kalevipoeg" (1857–61) was bilingual, the German text being presented side by side with the Estonian original. A popular Estonian edition in a single volume followed in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=1966 Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lydia Koidula]] (1843–1886) was the initiator of a tradition of Estonian patriotic and [[Women in Estonia|women]]'s poetry during the era.

===Late 19th early 20th century===

In the late 19th-century a poet emerged who profoundly affected Estonian poetry as a whole – [[Juhan Liiv]] (1864–1913). During the last decade of the 19th century, a contemporary of Liiv's, [[Eduard Vilde]] (1865–1933), gave a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] direction to Estonian prose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=946 Literature in the 19th century] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

With the formation of the group Noor-Eesti (Young Estonia) in 1905, led by the poet [[Gustav Suits]] (1883–1956), the linguist and poet [[Villem Grünthal-Ridala]] (1885-1942) and the reformer of the Estonian language [[Johannes Aavik]] (1880–1973), Estonian literature gained a new intellectual impetus. The most prominent prose writer of the time, still widely read today, was [[Oskar Luts]] (1887–1953). Another significant author was [[Jaan Oks]] (1884–1918).The poetry of [[Ernst Enno]] (1875–1934) gained popularity much later.

The rationality of the Young Estonians was counterbalanced by the group of writers from the [[Siuru]] movement, established in 1917. The central and peripheral poets of Siuru were: [[August Gailit]] (1891-1960), [[Friedebert Tuglas]] (1886-1971), [[Johannes Semper]] (1892-1970), [[Artur Adson]] (1889-1977), [[August Alle]] (1890-1952), [[Henrik Visnapuu]] (1890–1951), [[Peet Aren]] (1889-1970), [[Otto Krusten]] (1888-1937) and [[Marie Under]] (1883–1980).

The magazine ''Eesti Kirjandus'' (''Estonian Literature'') was founded in 1906, and ''Eesti Kirjanduse Selts'' (Estonian Literary Society) in 1907.

===1918-1940===
After the establishment of the [[Republic of Estonia]], professionalism and diversity in literature were followed by the emergence of literary institutions. The Estonian Writers Union was founded in 1922; the literary monthly ''[[Looming (journal)|Looming]]'' (Creation) first appeared in 1923 and is still the main periodical of its sort in Estonia. The Cultural Endowment Fund started work in 1925 and is the major provider of grants in the arts in the present-day Republic of Estonia.

The prevailing tendency in prose writing between the two World Wars was realism. The most prominent writer of the era is [[Anton Hansen Tammsaare]] (1878–1940). His five volume epic novel ''Tõde ja Õigus'' (Truth and Justice, 1926–1933) is considered one of the major works of Estonian literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tammsaar.htm |title=Anton Tammsaare |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054341/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tammsaar.htm |archivedate=5 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent prose writers were [[August Mälk]] (1900–1987), [[Karl Ristikivi]] (1912–1977). [[August Gailit]], the incurable romantic, appeared on the literary scene along with the [[Siuru]] group.

The ''[[Arbujad]]'' ("Soothsayers") was a small but influential group of poets who began collaborating in 1938 at the behest of poet and author [[Ants Oras]] (1900-1982) and included: [[Betti Alver]] (1906–1989), [[Uku Masing]] (1909–1985), [[Mart Raud]] (1903–1980), [[Kersti Merilaas]] (1913–1986), [[Bernard Kangro]] (1910–1994), [[Heiti Talvik]] (1904–1947), [[August Sang]] (1914–1969) and [[Paul Viiding]] (1904–1962). While group's poetic works tended to be eclectic, there was a common desire among members to reach a deeper intellectual and emotional plane. The ''Arbujad'' poets were for the freedom and independence of the people while being against ideological coercion and totalitarian concepts.

===Post World War II===
After the [[Estonia in World War II|Second World War]] Estonian literature was split in two for almost half a century. A number of prominent writers who spent the war years in Estonia fled from Soviet forces to Germany in 1944 (Visnapuu) or to Sweden, either directly or via Finland (Suits, Under, Gailit, Kangro, Mälk, Ristikivi). Many of those who remained behind and did not follow the ideology of the Soviet occupying power suffered either death in Siberia (Talvik and playwright Hugo Raudsepp) or a combination of repression, a ban on publication and interior exile ([[Friedebert Tuglas|Tuglas]], Alver, Masing). Despite the modest circumstances of the war and post-war years, creative activity and publishing started almost immediately, both in the temporary stopovers in Finland, and in the refugee camps in Sweden and Germany.

====In Exile====
In 1945 the Estonian Writers' Union in Exile was founded in [[Stockholm]]. In 1950 [[Bernard Kangro]] began publishing the cultural magazine ''Tulimuld'' in Lund (published until 1993). Eesti Kirjanike Kooperatiiv, the largest Estonian-language publishing house in exile, was set up and its method of book distribution secured the continuity of literary life on an institutional level and on a global scale, except in the Soviet-controlled homeland. Estonians abroad also did their best to introduce Estonian literature to the world: in the USA, [[Ivar Ivask]] (1927–1992) edited ''[[World Literature Today]]'' in which he published numerous articles and reviews about Estonian literature.

The poetry collection by surrealist [[Ilmar Laaban]] (1921–2000) was at first the only modernist work, until 1953 when [[Karl Ristikivi]], essentially a conservative writer, published his novel  ''The Night of the Souls''. [[Arved Viirlaid]]'s (1922) novel ''Seitse kohtupäeva'' (Seven Days of Trial, 1957) was a detour into modernism.  [[Ilmar Jaks]] (1923) became a more consistent cultivator of the technique of the modern novel. The subject matter of literary output was greatly enriched by descriptions of the countries where various writers had settled, like  [[Karl Rumor]] (1886–1971) in Brazil, or [[Gert Helbemäe]] (1913–1974) in England.  In the second half of the 1950s Kalju Lepik (1920–1999) was a poet in exile who rose to prominence alongside Bernard Kangro. Kalju Lepik's first visit to his homeland in 1990 and the publication of his last collections of poetry there, symbolises the end of the split.

====Behind the Iron Curtain====

In Estonia a relaxation of the strictures of the Soviet regime after the death of Stalin opened the way for various Estonian writers: [[Minni Nurme]] (1917-1994), [[Jaan Kross]]  (1920–2007) [[Artur Alliksaar]] (1923–1966), [[Ain Kaalep]] (born 1921), [[Kersti Merilaas]] (1916–1986) and [[Ellen Niit]] (born 1928). Against that background a new "Cassette Generation"  emerged in 1962-1967 (so-called because of the small poetry chapbooks which appeared together in small cardboard boxes termed ''kassett'' in Estonian). [[Jaan Kaplinski]] (born 1941) was greatly inspired by Oriental religion and nature. Other authors of note were [[Hando Runnel]] (born 1938), [[Viivi Luik]] (born 1946), [[Mats Traat]] (born 1936), [[Andres Ehin]] (born 1940) and [[Ilmar Laaban]]. 

The political stagnation that followed the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 was reflected in [[Paul-Eerik Rummo]]'s initially banned minimalist collection. The collection did not appear in its entirety until 1989. So-called alternative literature was disseminated in manuscript form, the most significant authors in this field being the dissident poet Johnny B. Isotamm (born 1939) and the prose writer [[Toomas Vint]]  (born 1944). The most remarkable poet of the 1960s and 1970s was [[Juhan Viiding]]  (pseudonym Jüri  Üdi, 1948–1995, son of former Arbujad member, poet Paul Viiding), whose first collection "Nerve Print" appeared in 1971. Despite all attempts to ban it, the popular and song-like nature of Hando Runnel's patriotic verse secured its huge circulation. His collection "The Purple of the Red Evenings", 1982 was allowed into print but the publication of any reviews in the press remained forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=948 The split in Estonian literature] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991-2001===
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] led to the restoration of [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]]'s [[History of Estonia#Regaining independence|independence]]. The two Estonian Writers' Unions were merged in 2000.

In a way, Emil Tode’s (pen name of [[Tõnu Õnnepalu]], 1962) "Piiririik" ("Border State") marked the beginning of a new era in 1993. The novel claimed its place beside the internationally recognised and translated works by Kross or Kaplinski. "Border State" also raised the topic of "Euro-literature", where one of the central issues is the wanderings of Estonians abroad, their search for an identity in a world with open borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/12/estonian-lit-during-last-decade-stars-and-trends Estonian literature during the last decade - Stars and trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intertextual poetry of [[Jaan Undusk]] (born 1958), [[Mati Unt]] and [[Viivi Luik]] and [[Hasso Krull]] (born 1964) prepared the ground for a bold new Estonian literature. The most remarkable prose writers of the younger generation of recent years are [[Andrus Kivirähk]] (born 1970), [[Karl-Martin Sinijärv]] (born 1971), [[Mehis Heinsaar]] (born 1973), [[Peeter Sauter]] (born 1962) or [[Jüri Ehlvest]]  (1967–2006), who deepened the subjects and topics opened up by Õnnepalu in a way both comical and cryptic. 

[[Jaan Kross]] and [[Jaan Kaplinski]] remain Estonia's best known and most translated writers, although in recent years the short stories of [[Eeva Park]] and the novels of Tõnu Õnnepalu and [[Ervin Õunapuu]] have also been enjoying moderate success in Germany and Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/14/mission-estonia-estonian-literature-finnish Mission Estonia. On Estonian Literature in Finnish]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaan Kross has been tipped for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] on several occasions. On his return from the labour camps and internal exile in Russia, where he spent nine long years (1946–1954) as a political prisoner, Kross breathed new life into Estonian poetry.  Kross began writing prose in the latter half of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=646 Jaan Kross] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;  Jaan Kaplinski has become the central and most productive Modernist in Estonian poetry. Kaplinski has written essays, plays and has translated. He has lectured in [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Trieste]], [[Taipei]], [[Stockholm]], [[Bologna]] and [[Cologne]], [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He has been Writer-in-Residence at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=625 Jaan Kaplinski] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new century===
The beginning of the 21st century has been fruitful for Estonian literature. Blossoming out of the waning nineties; a new, vibrant generation of poets appeared. [[Jürgen Rooste]] (1979), [[Ivar Sild]] (1977), [[Wimberg]] (pen name of Jaak Urmet, 1979) and [[Kristiina Ehin]] (1977) have all distinctive voices combined with a profound knowledge of both Estonian and world literature.

Rooste is definitely the most socially-involved and "beat-like" of them all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/23/jurgen-rooste-love-and-pain/ Jürgen Rooste - Love and Pain]&lt;/ref&gt; Sild proclaims his gay outlook, Wimberg creates absurd landscapes through the use of childlike language and style&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/17/wimberg/ Wimberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ehin maintains the tradition of the "great female poet" of Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/25/kristiina-ehins-drums-silence-new-moon-morning/ Kristiina Ehin's Drums of Silence on a New Moon Morning]&lt;/ref&gt;

But prose also flourishes. Over recent years, the work of [[Rein Raud]] has won him both numerous awards at home and international acclaim. His most notable books include "The Reconstruction", the story of a dying father trying to find out the circumstances of his daughter's suicide in a religious cult (2012, in English 2017, Dalkey Archive Press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/product/the-reconstruction/|title=The Reconstruction {{!}} Dalkey Archive Press|website=www.dalkeyarchive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "The Brother" (2008, in English 2016, Open Letter Books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openletterbooks.org/collections/books/products/the-brother|title=The Brother - Open Letter|website=Open Letter|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), called by the author "a spaghetti Western in poetic prose". [[Andrus Kivirähk]] has skilfully combined his comic talent and ethno-fantasy in "The Man Who Spoke Snakish" (2007, in English 2015, Grove Press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groveatlantic.com/?title=The+Man+Who+Spoke+Snakish|title=The Man Who Spoke Snakish by Andrus Kivirahk|website=www.groveatlantic.com|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Indrek Hargla]] is a prolific writer of several kinds of genre fiction including sci-fi, fantasy and crime. His reputation relies mainly on his Apothecary Melchior series, set in medieval Tallinn. Besides [[Kaur Kender]] (1971), whose finest hour was in 1998 with the debut novel "Iseseisvuspäev" ("Independence Day"), a younger generation is appearing. [[Sass Henno]] (1982) stays in the [[Chuck Palahniuk]]-influenced tradition of Kaur Kender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/20/future-classics-how-should-freedom-be-used/ Future Classics - How Should Freedom Be Used?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaneldior]] wrote a quintessential novel in the manner of [[Bret Easton Ellis]] called "Kontrolli alt väljas" ("Out of Control") in 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/27/younger-estonian-prose/ Younger Estonian prose]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peeter Helme]]'s (1978) second novel "September" (2009) received critical acclaim for its realistic description of life in Tallinn's office environments as existed at the dawn of this new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/?id=119803 Tallinna plekkmehed ja plekknaised]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exploitation fiction''' is a type of [[literature]] that includes [[novel]]s and [[magazine]]s that [[wikt:exploitation|exploit]] [[sex]], [[violence]], [[drug]]s, or other elements meant to attract readers primarily by arousing prurient interest without being labeled as [[obscene]] or [[pornography|pornographic]].

Exploitation fiction grew out of [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] of the 1930s and 1940s. It was popular "trash fiction" in the form of [[mass market paperback]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, when genuine, sexually explicit material could be seized as obscene. In the [[United States]], material that went by [[U.S. Postal Service|U.S. mail]] was subject to federal obscenity laws that greatly curtailed the distribution of materials that were sexually explicit or featured graphic violence. These cheap novels exploited violence, drugs, and sex—especially promiscuity and [[lesbianism]]—but rarely delivered the kind of salacious detail their cover art implied and generally tacked on moralistic endings to satisfy critics who accused them of having "no redeeming social value." They were often repackaged under new titles with different cover art, to resell to the unsuspecting public looking for cheap thrills.

As [[Motion Picture Production Code|film production codes]] loosened in the early 1960s, exploitation fiction led to [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]] (again parallel to the development of ''giallo'' cinema), typified by [[Russ Meyer]] films.

'''Fashion design''' is the [[art]] of applying [[design]], [[aesthetics]] and natural beauty to [[clothing]] and its [[Fashion accessory|accessories]]. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place. [[Fashion designers]] work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market, designers must at times [[Fashion forecasting|anticipate changes to consumer tastes]].

Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer’s role; however, there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1517632943/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_TIXlzbNKHZAEH|title=Fashion Buying and Merchandising: From mass-market to luxury retail|last=Hebrero|first=Miguel|date=2015-10-15|publisher=CreateSpace|year=|isbn=9781517632946|location=Printed in the USA|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, they have a wide range and combinations of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as [[formal wear|evening wear]] or party [[dress]]es.

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of [[haute couture]] or [[bespoke tailoring]]. Today, most clothing is designed for the [[mass market]], especially casual and every-day wear are called [[ready to wear]].

== Structure ==
Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other [[high-end]] fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Tween Brands|Justice]], or [[Juicy Couture|Juicy]] are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.

== Designing a garment ==
Fashion designers work in different ways. Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form. When a designer is completely satisfied with the fit of the ''toile'' (or muslin), he or she will consult a professional pattern maker who then makes the finished, working version of the pattern out of card or via a computerized system. Finally, a sample garment is made up and tested on a model to make sure it is an operational outfit.

==History==
[[File:Chéruit Salon Paris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Louise Chéruit|Chéruit]] salon on [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, 1910]]
{{main article|History of fashion design}}
Fashion design is generally considered to have started in the 19th century with [[Charles Frederick Worth]] who was the first designer to have his [[label]] sewn into the garments that he created. Before the former [[draper]] set up his ''maison couture'' (fashion house) in [[Paris]], clothing design and creation was handled by largely anonymous seamstresses, and high fashion descended from that worn at royal courts. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term ''couturier'' was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered as fashion design.

It was during this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs instead of presenting completed garments on models to customers began as an economy.

==Types of fashion==
The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

===Haute couture===
{{Main article|Haute couture}}
Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a [[made-to-measure]] or [[haute couture]] basis ([[French language|French]] for high-sewing), with each garment being created for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Haute Couture?|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture/|work=Haute Couture Hot|publisher=HauteCoutureNews.com|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haute Couture Fashion History|url=http://fashion-era.com/haute_couture.htm|work=Fashion-Era.com|publisher=Fashion-Era.com|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Pauline Weston Thomas|format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7883236/Haute-couture-Making-a-loss-is-the-height-of-fashion.html|title=Haute couture: Making a loss is the height of fashion|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ready-to-wear (prêt-à-porter)===
{{Main article|Ready-to-wear}}

Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as [[Fashion Week]]. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of [[Fashion Week]] include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

===Mass market===

}}
{{Main article|Mass market}}

Currently the [[fashion industry]] relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. To save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designers Flock to Mass-Market Retailers|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87177&amp;page=1#.T68WL9kZHIU|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Catherine Valenti|format=Article|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out from Underground|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/10/31/out-from-underground.html|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Sameer Reddy|format=Article|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass market broached by high-end fashion |url=http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091#.T68YgNkZHIU |work=The Prospector |publisher=College Media Network |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephania Lara |format=Article |date=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205229/http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091 |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a type of design called "kutch" design originated from the German word "kitschig" meaning "ugly" or "not aesthetically pleasing".  ''Kitsch'' can also refer to "wearing or displaying something that is therefore no longer in fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitsch pickings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3e2b1f30-7f3a-11e1-b3d4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1uiFiHExC|work=Financial Times Online: Style|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Bethan Cole|format=Article|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Income ==
Median annual wages for salaried fashion designers were $61,160 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $42,150 and $87,120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Designers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Arts-and-Design/Fashion-designers.htm|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,150, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $124,780. Median annual earnings were $52,860 (£40,730.47) in apparel, piece goods, and notions - the industry employing the largest numbers of fashion designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/ooh20022003/ocos090.htm|title=Designers|work=umsl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016,a fashion designer's median annual salary was $65,170. High end designers can earn around $92,550. In the year of 2016, 23,800 people were accounted as fashion designers in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;((cite web/ url= https://work.chron.com/starting-salary-range-fashion-designer-9391.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==World fashion industry==
[[File:Garment District NYWTS crop.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Men pulling carts of women's clothing in [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]], New York, 1955]]

Fashion today is a global industry, and most major countries have a fashion industry. [[China]]  , [[Bangladesh]] and India are the biggest manufacturers of clothing, and other notable clothing manufacturing countries are [[Germany]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], and [[Brazil]].

The "big four" centers of the fashion industry are [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[Milan]], [[New York City]] and [[London]]. Seven countries have established an international reputation in fashion: [[French fashion|France]], [[Italian fashion|Italy]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Japanese Fashion|Japan]], [[German fashion|Germany]] and [[Belgium]].

===American fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the United States}}
[[File:"Elements" Fashion Show at College of DuPage 2015 30 (17334518498).jpg|thumb|260px|Fashion show at a fashion designing college, USA, 2015]]

Most fashion houses in the United States are based in [[New York City]], with a high concentration centered in the [[Garment District, New York City|Garment District]] neighborhood. On the west coast, there are also a significant number of fashion houses in [[Los Angeles]], where a substantial percentage of high fashion clothing manufactured in the United States is actually made. [[Beverly Hills]], particularly on [[Rodeo Drive]], is globally renowned for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and especially [[San Francisco]] have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, [[New York Fashion Week]] is the oldest of the four major [[fashion week]]s held throughout the world. [[Parsons The New School for Design]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City, is considered as one of the top fashion schools in the world. There are numerous fashion magazines published in the United States and distributed around the world for global readership.

American fashion design is dominated by a clean-cut, urban, casual style; reflecting the [[athlete|athletic]], health-conscious lifestyles of urban city-dwellers.

===Belgian fashion design===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Belgian fashion designers brought a new fashion image that mixed East and West, and brought a highly individualised, personal vision on fashion. Well known Belgian Designers are the [[Antwerp Six]] : [[Ann Demeulemeester]], [[Dries Van Noten]], [[Dirk Bikkembergs]], [[Dirk Van Saene]], [[Walter Van Beirendonck]] and Marina Yee, as well as [[Martin Margiela|Maison Martin Margiela]], [[Raf Simons]], [[Kris Van Assche]], [[Bruno Pieters]], [[Anthony Vaccarello]]&lt;ref&gt;Holgate, Mark, ′How Anthony Vaccarello Is Making Saint Laurent His Own′, (Feb. 13, 2018), Vogue March 2018, https://www.vogue.com/article/anthony-vaccarello-interview-vogue-march-2018-issue, Retrieved 3 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===British fashion design===
[[London]] has long been the capital of the United Kingdom fashion industry and has a wide range of foreign designs which have integrated with modern British styles. Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain.
Famous British brands and designers include [[Burberry]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Alfred Dunhill]], [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[John Galliano]], [[John Richmond (fashion designer)|John Richmond]], [[Neil Barrett (fashion designer)|Neil Barrett]], [[Matthew Williamson]], [[Hussein Chalayan]], [[Gareth Pugh]], [[Stella McCartney]], [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]], [[Thomas Pink]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British fashion designers|url=http://www.visitbritain.com/en/Fashion-designers/|work=Visit Britain|publisher=Visit Britain|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the Soviet Union}}
Fashion in the [[Soviet Union]] largely followed general trends of the Western world. However, the state's [[Socialism|socialist ideology]] consistently moderated and influenced these trends. In addition, shortages of [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] meant that the general public did not have ready access to pre-made fashion.

===Swiss fashion design===
Most of the Swiss fashion houses are in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich labels|url=http://www.zuerich.com/files/?id=40184|work=Zurich labels: Media Information|publisher=Zurich Tourism|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss look is casual elegant and luxurious with a slight touch of quirkiness. Additionally, it has been greatly influenced by the dance club scene.

==Fashion design services==
{{or|date=April 2017}}
Fashion design services provide services like [[Trend forecasting|trend]] and color forecasting, [[market analysis]], design concepts and [[design document]]ation for [[manufacturer]]s. This way the manufacturer can contract out the design requirements rather than maintaining an in-house design team. Fashion design services providers can either sell the [[design]]s outright or license them out on a [[Royalties|royalty]] basis.

If someone is interested in launching a line in footwear, handbags, bedding etc. and are looking to outsource the design work, then a fashion design services provider can help. When initially launching the business, it might be expensive to launch with many new designs, and thus a licensing option from such a company might save startup cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS160645+17-Aug-2009+PRN20090817 27th Point Launches a New Program to Help Start-Up Manufacturers in the Home and Fashion Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design terms==
* A '''fashion designer''' conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
* A '''technical designer''' works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass-producing the garment.
* A '''[[Pattern (sewing)|pattern maker]]''' (''also referred as pattern master or'' ''pattern cutter'') drafts the shapes and sizes of a garment's pieces. This may be done manually with paper and measuring tools or by using a CAD computer software program. Another method is to drape fabric directly onto a dress form. The resulting pattern pieces can be constructed to produce the intended design of the garment and required size. Formal training is usually required for working as a pattern marker.
* A '''[[tailor]]''' makes custom designed garments made to the client's measure; especially suits (coat and trousers, jacket and skirt, et cetera). Tailors usually undergo an apprenticeship or other formal training.
* A '''[[Textiles|textile designer]]''' designs fabric weaves and prints for clothes and furnishings. Most textile designers are formally trained as apprentices and in school.
* A '''[[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]]''' co-ordinates the clothes, jewelry, and accessories used in fashion photography and catwalk presentations. A stylist may also work with an individual client to design a coordinated wardrobe of garments. Many stylists are trained in fashion design, the history of fashion, and historical costume, and have a high level of expertise in the current fashion market and future market trends. However, some simply have a strong aesthetic sense for pulling great looks together.
* A '''[[fashion buyer]]''' selects and buys the mix of clothing available in retail shops, department stores, and chain stores. Most fashion buyers are trained in business and/or fashion studies.
*A '''[[seamstress]]''' sews ready-to-wear or mass-produced clothing by hand or with a sewing machine, either in a garment shop or as a sewing machine operator in a factory. She (or he) may not have the skills to make (design and cut) the garments, or to fit them on a model.
* A '''[[teacher|teacher of fashion design]]''' teaches the art and craft of fashion design in art or fashion school.
* A '''custom clothier''' makes custom-made garments to order, for a given customer.
* A '''[[dressmaker]]''' specializes in custom-made women's clothes: day, cocktail, and evening dresses, business clothes and suits, trousseaus, sports clothes, and lingerie. 

* An '''[[illustration|illustrator]]''' draws and paints clothing designs for commercial use.
* A '''[[fashion forecasting|fashion forecaster]]''' predicts what colours, styles and shapes will be popular ("on-trend") before the garments are on sale in stores.
* A '''[[Fashion model|model]]''' wears and displays clothes at fashion shows and in photographs.
* A '''[[fit model]]''' aids the fashion designer by wearing and commenting on the fit of clothes during their design and pre-manufacture. Fit models need to be a particular size for this purpose.
* A '''[[Fashion journalism|fashion journalist]]''' writes fashion articles describing the garments presented or fashion trends, for magazines or newspapers.
* An '''alterations specialist''' ('''alterationist''') adjusts the fit of completed garments, usually ready-to-wear, and sometimes re-styles them. NOTE: despite tailors altering garments to fit the client, not all alterationists are tailors.
* An '''image consultant''', '''wardrobe consultant''' or '''fashion advisor''' recommends styles and colors that are flattering to the client.

'''Frank Vincent Zappa'''{{refn|group=nb|Until discovering his birth certificate as an adult, Zappa believed he had been christened "Francis Vincent Zappa" after his father, and he is credited as Francis on some of his early albums. The name on his birth certificate however is "Frank", not "Francis".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|15}}}} (December 21, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, activist and filmmaker. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; In a career spanning more than 30&amp;nbsp;years, Zappa composed [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], [[orchestra]]l and ''[[musique concrète]]'' works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band [[&lt;!--Do not capitalize--&gt;the Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-zappa-mn0000138699/biography|title=Frank Zappa {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Sterling|title=The Day Frank Zappa Died|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/frank-zappa-death/|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maume|first1=Chris|title=Gail Zappa: Frank Zappa's wife, muse and manager who ferociously protected his musical legacy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gail-zappa-frank-zappas-wife-muse-and-manager-who-ferociously-protected-his-musical-legacy-a6691251.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], along with 1950s [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckley|first1=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Rock: [The Definitive Guide to More Than 1200 Artists and Bands]|date=November 17, 2003|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|page=1211|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional [[rock and roll]] format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound [[collage]]s. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.

Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; His lyrics reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so. Zappa's often comedic lyrics led [[AllMusic]] to describe him as the "godfather" of [[comedy rock]].&lt;ref name="Comedy rock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs and never used them again after briefly trying marijuana,&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rolling Stone Interview|year=1988|first=Kurt|last=Loder|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supported their decriminalization and regulation.

During Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]] for most of his career. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His honors include his 1995 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the 1997 [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==1940s–1960s: Early life and career==

===Childhood===
Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie ({{nee}} Collimore) was of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and [[French Americans|French]] ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from [[Partinico]], [[Sicily]], with [[Greek Americans|Greek]] and [[Arab Americans|Arab]]&lt;!-- do not change this to Lebanese: the cited source says Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French--&gt; ancestry.{{refn|group=nb|"My ancestry is Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French. My mother's mother was French and Sicilian, and her Dad was Italian (from Naples). She was first generation. The Greek-Arab side is from my Dad. He was born in a Sicilian village called Partinico&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zappa |first1=Frank |authorlink=Frank Zappa |last2=Occhiogrosso |first2=Peter |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |date=1989 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where [[Italian language|Italian]] was often spoken by his grandparents.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"&gt;''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|6}} The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood, Maryland|Edgewood]] Arsenal [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}} This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa| first = Barry| last = Miles| publisher=Atlantic Books| location = London| year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84354-092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[earache]]s and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|title=Nasopharyngeal Radium Irradiation (NRI) and Cancer|date=January 2003|work=National Cancer Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411012948/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|archivedate=April 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator [[Cal Schenkel]]. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|22}} They next moved to [[Monterey, California]], where his father taught [[metallurgy]] at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]. They soon moved to [[Claremont, California]],&lt;ref name=slaven03&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa|edition=2nd|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4EyfFjQ3DgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} then to [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], before finally settling in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiegotroubadour.com/wp-content/pdf/2005_11_Nov.pdf|format=PDF|title=Counter Culture Coincidence|work=San Diego Troubadour|last=Mendoza|first=Bart|page=4|date=November 11, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First musical interests===
{{quote box|quote=Since I didn't have any kind of formal training, it didn't make any difference to me if I was listening to Lightnin' Slim, or a vocal group called the Jewels&amp;nbsp;..., or Webern, or Varèse, or Stravinsky. To me it was all good music.|source= — Frank Zappa, 1989&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|34}}|width=25em}}

Zappa joined his first band at [[Mission Bay High School]] in San Diego as the drummer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} At about the same time, his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|22}} [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singles were early purchases, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|36}} He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began&lt;ref name="idol"/&gt; when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} The article described [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Varèse)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers. He also liked the Italian classical music listened to by his grandparents, especially [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera arias.

[[File:Frank Zappa HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa's senior yearbook photo, 1958]]
By 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; he would later refer to Sun Village (a town close to Lancaster) in the 1973 track "Village of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Roxy_and_Elsewhere.html#Village|title=Lyrics of Village Of The Sun|first=Frank|last=Zappa|date=December 1973|work=Village Of The Sun, Roxy and Elsewhere|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later. In a letter Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition he was working on called "[[Déserts]]". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="idol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Edgard Varese: The Idol of My Youth|journal=Stereo Review|pages=61–62|date=June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|On several of his earlier albums, Zappa paid tribute to Varèse by quoting his: "The present-day composer refuses to die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Friendly Remainders: Essays in Music Criticism after Adorno|first1=Murray|last1=Dineen|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7735-8576-8|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C&amp;pg=PA122 Extract of page 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Glen Vliet (who later changed his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]]). Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&amp;B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|29–30}} Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}} The band was racially diverse and included [[Jim Sherwood|Euclid James "Motorhead" Sherwood]] who later became a member of the Mothers of Invention. Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument. Among his early influences were [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. (In the 1970s/80s, he invited Watson to perform on several albums.) Zappa considered soloing as the equivalent of forming "air sculptures",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frank Zappa|first1=Barry|last1=Miles|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78239-678-9|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266 Extract of page 266]&lt;/ref&gt; and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z)|edition=illusdtrated|first1=Ben|last1=Watson|first2=Esther|last2=Leslie|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|year=2005|isbn=978-0-946719-79-2|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&amp;pg=PA223 Extract of page 223]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's interest in composing and arranging flourished in his last high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, [[arrangement|arranging]] and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|40}} He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album ''Freak Out!''&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|48}} In 1959, he attended [[Chaffey College]] but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|345}}

Zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], Los Angeles. After meeting Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman during his short period of private composition study with Prof. [[Karl Kohn]] of [[Pomona College]], they moved in together in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], and were married December 28, 1960.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa worked for a short period in advertising. His sojourn in the commercial world was brief, but gave him valuable insights into its workings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|40}} Throughout his career, he took a keen interest in the visual presentation of his work, designing some of his album covers and directing his own films and videos.

===Studio Z===
Zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|59}} Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films ''[[The World's Greatest Sinner]]'' (1962) and ''Run Home Slow'' (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer [[Timothy Carey]] and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|63}} The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|55}} Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996).

During the early 1960s, Zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] and producer Paul Buff. Their "[[Memories of El Monte]]" was recorded by [[the Penguins]], although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 1984, ''Mother!'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Buff owned the small [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|42}} Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|74}} He appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of the Soots. They were rejected by [[Dot Records]] for having "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref name=watson96&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 1996| publisher=St. Martin's Griffin| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-312-14124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

In 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the Pal studio and began routinely working 12&amp;nbsp;hours or more per day recording and experimenting with [[overdubbing]] and [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#As a musical instrument|audio tape manipulation]]. This established a work pattern that endured for most of his life.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|43}} Aided by his income from film composing, Zappa took over the studio from Paul Buff, who was now working with [[Art Laboe]] at [[Original Sound]]. It was renamed Studio Z.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|80–81}} Studio Z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. Instead, friends moved in, notably James "Motorhead" Sherwood.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|82–83}} Zappa started performing in local bars as a guitarist with a [[power trio]], the Muthers, to support himself.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

An article in the local press describing Zappa as "the Movie King of Cucamonga" prompted the local police to suspect that he was making [[pornography|pornographic]] films.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a [[Vice unit|vice squad]] undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1965|fmt=eq}}) to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged [[Bachelor party|stag party]]. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about to hand over the tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's ''[[The Daily Report]]'' wrote that "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harp |first=Ted |title=Vice Squad Raids Local Film Studio | newspaper=The Daily Report | place = Ontario, California | date = March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa was charged with "conspiracy to commit pornography".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|57}} This [[felony]] charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a [[misdemeanor]], with all but ten days suspended.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|86–87}} His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|xv}} Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|87}} Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|90–91}}

==Late 1960s: The Mothers of Invention==

===Formation===
In 1965, [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] asked Zappa to take over as guitarist in local R&amp;B band the Soul Giants, following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"/&gt; Zappa accepted, and soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer&lt;ref name="HighTimes1980"/&gt;). He convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|42}} They increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles [[underground music]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] when playing "Trouble Every Day", a song about the [[Watts riots]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|103}} Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], and was notable as one of the few African-Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed the Mothers to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] division of [[MGM Records|MGM]], which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves [[the Mothers of Invention]] as ''Mother'' was short for ''[[motherfucker]]''—a term that, apart from its profane meanings, can denote a skilled musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | people = Nigel Leigh | title = Interview with Frank Zappa | medium = BBC Late Show | publisher=BBC [TV Show] | location = UMRK, Los Angeles, CA |date=March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debut album: ''Freak Out!''===
With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), which, after Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock double album ever released. It mixed R&amp;B, [[doo-wop]], musique concrète,&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite book| title = The Words and Music of Frank Zappa| first = Kelly Fisher| last = Lowe| publisher=Praeger Publishers| location = Westport| year = 2006| isbn = 978-0-275-98779-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture of Los Angeles at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was dissatisfied with the final product, ''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|115}} The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs.&lt;ref name=watson05&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 2005| publisher=Omnibus Press| location = London| isbn = 978-1-84449-865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most [[Overdubbing|overdubs]]. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} Although Wilson was able to provide Zappa and the Mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. In a surviving 1967 radio interview, Zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was in fact an unfinished piece. The track (as it appears on the album) was created to act as the backing track for a much more complex work, but MGM refused to approve the additional recording time Zappa needed to complete it, so (much to his chagrin) it was issued in this unfinished form.&lt;ref&gt;"How We Made It Sound That Way", interview on WDET Detroit, November 13, 1967 (excerpt included as part of the [[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO]] album, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the recording of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa moved into a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] with friend Pamela Zarubica, who appeared on the album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and [[groupie]]s of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|122}} After a short promotional tour following the release of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa met [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]]. He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.

Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|5}} Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|38–43}} As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|135–38}} At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'', released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–41}} It is an "incredible ambitious musical project",&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|56}} a "monument to [[John Cage]]",&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical [[audio engineer|audio editing]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22630|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lumpy Gravy.

===New York period (1966–1968)===
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 [[Bleecker Street]], above the [[Cafe au Go Go]]) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, ''Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', pp. 62–69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–141}} Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|147}} Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|94}}

Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as [[AMM (group)|AMM]] and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}}|title=We're Only in It for the Money. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; He sampled plundered surf music in ''We're only in It for the Money'', as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song ''Tomorrow Never Knows''.&lt;ref&gt;Cox and Warner, 2004, ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover photo parodied that of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{refn|group=nb|As the legal aspects of using the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept were unsettled, the album was released with the cover and back on the inside of the gatefold, while the actual cover and back were a picture of the group in a pose parodying the inside of the Beatles album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|151}}}} The cover art was provided by [[Cal Schenkel]] whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|88}}

Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&amp;nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} A theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is heard during one song.

During the late 1960s, Zappa continued to develop the business sides of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the [[Bizarre Records]] and [[Straight Records]] labels, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], as ventures to aid the funding of projects and to increase creative control. Zappa produced the double album ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' for [[Captain Beefheart]], and releases by [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Persuasions]], [[Wild Man Fischer]], and [[the GTOs]], as well as [[Lenny Bruce]]'s last live performance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|173–175}}

In 1967 and 1968, Zappa made two appearances with [[the Monkees]]. The first appearance was on an episode of [[The Monkees (TV series)|their TV series]], "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where Zappa, dressed up as [[Michael Nesmith|Mike Nesmith]], interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as Zappa. After the interview, Zappa destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "Mother People" plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie [[Head (film)|''Head'']] where, leading a cow, he tells [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] "the youth of America depends on you to show them the way." Zappa had respect for what the Monkees were doing, and offered [[Micky Dolenz]] a position in the Mothers. RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not allow Dolenz out of his contract.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|158–59}}

In the Mothers' second European tour in September/October 1968 they performed for the {{ill|Internationale Essener Songtage|de}} at the [[Grugahalle]] in [[Essen]], Germany; at the [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]] in Copenhagen, Denmark; for TV programs in Germany (''[[Beat-Club]]''), France, and England; at the [[Concertgebouw]] in Amsterdam; at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London; and at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zappateers.com/fzshows/6669.html September–October 1968: The 2nd European tour], zappateers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in mid-1968, and the Zappas moved into a house on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, only to move again to one on Woodrow Wilson Drive.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|178}} This was Zappa's home for the rest of his life. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially.&lt;ref name="walley116"&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his "electrical chamber music".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|119–120}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}}
[[File:Frank 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zappa with the Mothers of Invention, [[Boulevard de Clichy|Theatre de Clichy]], Paris, 1971]]
In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing [[royalties]] whether they played or not.&lt;ref name="walley116"/&gt; 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for [[Warner Bros. Records]]' [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.

In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|107}} but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|120}} Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}} Others were irritated by 'his [[Autocracy|autocratic]] ways',&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|116}} Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' and ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'' (both released in 1970).

After he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22632|pure_url=yes}}|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Hot Rats. Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}} It features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, "[[Peaches en Regalia]]", which reappeared several times on future recordings.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}} He was backed by jazz, blues and R&amp;B session players including violinist [[Don "Sugarcane" Harris]], drummers [[John Guerin]] and [[Paul Humphrey]], multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the Mothers of Invention [[Ian Underwood]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Shuggie Otis]] on bass, along with a guest appearance by [[Captain Beefheart]] (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, "Willie the Pimp"). It became a popular album in England,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} and had a major influence on the development of the [[jazz-rock fusion]] genre.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}}

==1970s==

===Rebirth of the Mothers and filmmaking===
[[File:FRANK ZAPPA3.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Zappa in Paris, early 1970s]]
In 1970 Zappa met conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. They arranged a May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie ''[[200 Motels]]''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|142–56}}

Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[the Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie", or "[[Flo &amp; Eddie]]".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|201}}

This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|205}} which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie ''200 Motels'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]. Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|207}} It was the first feature film photographed on [[videotape]] and transferred to [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]], a process that allowed for novel visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;Starks, 1982, ''Cocaine Fiends and Reefer Madness'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It was released to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|94}} The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|119–37}}

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East – June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band from L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances—which used songs to build sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|203–04}}{{refn|group=nb|During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track "Scumbag" and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called "Au"), which Zappa renamed "A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono.}}

===Accident, attack and aftermath===
[[File:Frank Zappa Mothers of Invention 1971.JPG|right|thumb|Zappa with the Mothers, 1971]]

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_WakaJawaka.ogg|description=The closing track on ''Waka/Jawaka'', one of Zappa's jazz-oriented albums.|title="Waka/Jawaka" (1971)|pos=right}}
On December 4, 1971, Zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation. After losing $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1971|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, audience member Trevor Howell pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}}

This attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "[[Dancin' Fool]]"), resulting in chronic back pain.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

During 1971–72 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|101}} Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats,'' in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} Zappa began touring again in late 1972.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&amp;nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top 10 album: ''Apostrophe ({{'}})''===
Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created [[DiscReet Records]], also distributed by Warner Bros.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|231}} Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album ''[[Apostrophe (')]]'' (1974), which reached a career-high No.&amp;nbsp;10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] pop album charts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}} | title= Frank Zappa &gt; Charts and Awards &gt; Billboard Albums | work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by the No.&amp;nbsp;86 chart hit "[[Don't Eat the Yellow Snow Suite|Don't Eat The Yellow Snow]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53148|pure_url=yes}} | title= Apostrophe (').

===Business breakups and touring===
[[File:Frank Zappa - Capt. Beefheart - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa with [[Captain Beefheart]], seated left, during a 1975 concert]]
Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|250}} Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' (1976) directly to [[Warner Bros.]], thereby bypassing DiscReet.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|253, 258–59}}

In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for ''[[Läther]]'' (pronounced "leather"), a four-LP project. ''Läther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|131}} Zappa managed to get an agreement with [[Phonogram Inc.]], and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Zappa responded by appearing on the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], allowing them to broadcast ''Läther'' and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|248}} A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the ''Läther'' material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|267}}{{refn|group=nb|When the music was first released on CD in 1991, Zappa chose to rerelease the four existing albums. ''Läther'' was released posthumously in 1996. It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Phonogram.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} In the liner notes to the 1996 release, Gail Zappa states that "As originally conceived by Frank, ''Läther'' was always a 4-record box set."}}

Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts,&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined. Among other musicians were bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]], singer-guitarist [[Ray White]] and keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]]. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|262}} Zappa's song "[[I'm the Slime]]" was performed with a voice-over by ''SNL'' booth announcer [[Don Pardo]], who also introduced "Peaches En Regalia" on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member [[John Belushi]] during the instrumental piece "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his Samurai Futaba character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Zappa, Frank, 1978, ''Zappa in New York'', Liner Notes.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The famous mustache and goatee.jpg|thumb|left|Zappa in Toronto, 1977]]
Zappa's band at the time, with the additions of Ruth Underwood and a horn section (featuring [[Michael Brecker|Michael]] and [[Randy Brecker]]), performed during Christmas in New York, recordings of which appear on one of the albums Warner Bros. culled from the ''Läther'' project, ''[[Zappa in New York]]'' (1978).

The double album ''Sheik Yerbouti'' was the first release on [[Zappa Records]], and contained the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single "Dancin' Fool", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;45 on the ''Billboard'' charts,&lt;ref name="BBsingles"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}}|title=Frank Zappa&gt; Charts &amp; Awards&gt; Billboard Singles|work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Jewish Princess (song)|Jewish Princess]]", which received attention when a Jewish group, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged [[anti-Semitic]] lyrics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|234}} Zappa vehemently denied any anti-Semitic sentiments, and dismissed the ADL as a "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their idea of a good time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=He's Only 38 and He Knows How to Nasty|last=Peterson|first=Chris|journal=Relix Magazine|date=November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's commercial success was attributable in part to "[[Bobby Brown (song)|Bobby Brown]]". Due to its explicit lyrics about a young man's encounter with a "dyke by the name of Freddie", the song did not get airplay in the U.S., but it topped the charts in several European countries where English is not the primary language.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|351}} The triple LP ''Joe's Garage'' featured lead singer [[Ike Willis]] as the voice of the character "Joe" in a [[rock opera]] about the danger of [[political system]]s,&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|140}} the suppression of [[freedom of speech]] and music—inspired in part by the [[Islamic revolution]] that had made music illegal within its jurisdiction at the time&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|277}}—and about the "strange relationship Americans have with sex and sexual frankness".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|140}} The album contains rock songs like "Catholic Girls" (a [[riposte]] to the controversies of "Jewish Princess"),&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|59}} "Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up", and the title track, as well as extended live-recorded guitar improvisations combined with a studio backup band dominated by drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] (with whom Zappa had a particularly good musical rapport)&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|180}} adopting the [[xenochrony]] process. The album contains one of Zappa's most famous guitar "signature pieces", "Watermelon in Easter Hay".&lt;ref name="DZlinernotes"&gt;The other signature pieces are "Zoot Allures" and "Black Napkins" from ''Zoot Allures''.

On December 21, 1979, Zappa's movie ''[[Baby Snakes]]'' premiered in New York. The movie's tagline was "A movie about people who do stuff that is not normal".&lt;ref&gt;Baby Snakes, 2003, ''DVD cover'', Eagle Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2&amp;nbsp;hour and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist [[Tommy Mars]] and percussionist [[Ed Mann]] (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist [[Adrian Belew]]. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of [[clay animation]] by [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]] who had earlier provided animation sequences to Zappa for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'').&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|}}282 The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/article_501.shtml|title=Baby Snakes|format= DVD|last=Sohmer|first=Adam|date=June 8, 2005|publisher=Big Picture Big Sound |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|282}}

Zappa later expanded on his television appearances in a non-musical role. He was an actor or voice artist in episodes of ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre|Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'',&lt;ref name="ZappaIMDB"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0953261|name=Frank Zappa profile|accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Miami Vice]]''&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|343}} and ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]''.&lt;ref name="ZappaIMDB"/&gt; A voice part in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' never materialized, to creator [[Matt Groening]]'s disappointment (Groening was a neighbor of Zappa and a lifelong fan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homer and Me|last=Eliscu|first=Jenny |journal=Rolling Stone|date=November 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song "[[I Don't Wanna Get Drafted]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_i5f3jhD9UC&amp;pg=PA3054|title=The New York Times Guide to the Arts of the 20th Century|accessdate=April 30, 2012|editor=Bruckner, D.

After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released ''[[Tinsel Town Rebellion]]'' in 1981. It was the first release on his own [[Barking Pumpkin Records]],&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of ''[[sprechstimme]]'' (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]]).&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|284}} the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and "The Blue Light" have been described as a "hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|165}} The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist [[Steve Vai]], who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|283}}

The same year the double album ''[[You Are What You Is]]'' was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen]] (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house,&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt; thereby giving him complete freedom in his work.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|269}} The album included one complex instrumental, "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53163|pure_url=yes}}|title=You Are What You Is. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dumb All Over" is a tirade on religion, as is "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against [[Televangelism|TV evangelists]] such as [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]] for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}} Songs like "Society Pages" and "I'm a Beautiful Guy" show Zappa's dismay with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] era and its "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}}
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_SYNPYG.ogg|description=The title track on ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'' features Zappa's guitar improvisations.|title=Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More|pos=left}}
In 1981, Zappa also released three instrumental albums, ''[[Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar]]'', ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More'', and ''The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'', which were initially sold via mail order, but later released through the [[CBS]] label due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Absolutely Frank.

The albums focus exclusively on Frank Zappa as a guitar soloist, and the tracks are predominantly live recordings from 1979 to 1980; they highlight Zappa's improvisational skills with "beautiful performances from the backing group as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swenson|first=John|journal=Guitar World|date=November 1981|title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another guitar-only album, ''[[Guitar (Frank Zappa album)|Guitar]]'', was released in 1988, and a third, ''[[Trance-Fusion]]'', which Zappa completed shortly before his death, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History |edition=illustrated |first1=Bob |last1=Gulla |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-313-35806-7 |page=251 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC&amp;pg=PA251 Extract of page 251]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Valley Girl" and classical performances===
In May 1982, Zappa released ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]'', which featured his biggest selling single ever, the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated song "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]" (topping out at No.&amp;nbsp;32 on the ''Billboard'' charts).&lt;ref name="BBsingles"/&gt; In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon Unit]] satirized the patois of teenage girls from the [[San Fernando Valley]], which popularized many "[[Valspeak]]" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon", "fer sure, fer sure", "grody to the max", and "barf out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2677879|pure_url=yes}}|title="Valley Girl" --song review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, two different projects were released, beginning with ''[[The Man from Utopia]],'' a rock-oriented work. The album is eclectic, featuring the vocal-led "Dangerous Kitchen" and "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats", both continuations of the sprechstimme excursions on ''Tinseltown Rebellion.'' The second album, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. I]]'', contained orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). A second record of these sessions, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. II]]'' was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "Valley Girl".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}} Zappa was not satisfied with the LSO recordings. One reason is "Strictly Genteel", which was recorded after the trumpet section had been out for drinks on a break: the track took 40 edits to hide out-of-tune notes.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}}

Conductor Nagano, who was pleased with the experience, noted that "in fairness to the orchestra, the music is humanly very, very difficult".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|315}} Some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of Zappa's orchestral work so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53172|pure_url=yes}}|title=London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1. Review|first=William|last=Ruhlmann|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Zappa teamed again with Nagano and the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/docs/A_Zappa_Affair.html |title=A Zappa Affair |website=Globalia.net |date= |accessdate=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a live performance of ''A Zappa Affair'' with augmented orchestra, life-size puppets, and moving stage sets. Although critically acclaimed the work was a financial failure, and only performed twice. Zappa was invited by conference organizer [[Thomas Wells (composer)|Thomas Wells]] to be the keynote speaker at the American Society of University Composers at the [[Ohio State University]]. It was there Zappa delivered his famous "Bingo! There Goes Your Tenure" address,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, [http://minuet.dance.ohio-state.edu/~ralley2/writings/bingo.html "Bingo!

===Synclavier===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_NavalAviation.ogg|description=A Zappa composition for classical ensemble from ''Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger''|title=Naval Aviation in Art?|pos=right}}
For the remainder of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the [[Synclavier]] as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize anything he could dream up.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages&amp;nbsp;... with ''one-millisecond'' accuracy—every time".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|319}} Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–173}}

In 1984, he released four albums. ''[[Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger]]'' contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist [[Pierre Boulez]] (who was listed as an influence on ''Freak Out!''), and performed by his [[Ensemble InterContemporain]]. These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|73}} The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].

The album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a Broadway play dealing with a [[dystopia]]n "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the AIDS virus, and a [[eugenics]] program conducted by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;The musical was eventually produced for the stage in 2003.

''[[Francesco Zappa (album)|Francesco Zappa]]'', a Synclavier rendition of works by 18th-century composer [[Francesco Zappa]] was also released in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |edition=illustrated |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 |page=2244 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&amp;pg=PA2244 Extract of page 2244]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital medium and last tour===
Around 1986, Zappa undertook a comprehensive re-release program of his earlier vinyl recordings.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|340}} He personally oversaw the remastering of all his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s albums for the new digital compact disc medium.{{refn|group=nb|For a comprehensive comparison of vinyl of CD releases, see {{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/|title=The Frank Zappa Album Versions Guide&amp;nbsp;– Index|series=The Zappa Patio|publisher=lukpac.org/~handmade/patio|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}}} Certain aspects of these re-issues were criticized by some fans as being unfaithful to the original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;For example, new drum and bass parts were used on the 1960s albums ''We're Only in It for the Money'' and ''Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets''. See Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly twenty years before the advent of online music stores, Zappa had proposed to replace "phonographic record merchandising" of music by "direct digital-to-digital transfer" through phone or cable TV (with royalty payments and consumer billing automatically built into the accompanying software).&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}} In 1989, Zappa considered his idea a "miserable flop".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}}

The album ''[[Jazz from Hell]],'' released in 1986, earned Zappa his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1988 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. Except for one live guitar solo ("St. Etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the Synclavier. Although an [[instrumental]] album, containing no lyrics, Meyer Music Markets sold ''Jazz from Hell'' featuring an "explicit lyrics" sticker—a warning label introduced by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in an agreement with the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|year=2001|title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-16772-1|pages=39, 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|346–50}} The tour was documented on the albums ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]'' (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); ''[[The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life]]'' (Zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Stairway to Heaven]]''); and ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]''. Parts are also found on ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore'', volumes [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4|4]] and [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 6|6]]. Recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album [[Trance-Fusion]].

In 1990, Zappa was diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable.&lt;ref name="Pulse1993"/&gt; After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and [[Synclavier]] works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed ''[[Civilization Phaze III]]'', a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|374–75}}{{refn|group=nb|It brought him a posthumous [[Grammy Award]] (with Gail Zappa) for [[Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package|Best Recording Package&amp;nbsp;– Boxed]] in 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search|title=Grammy Winners|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}}}

In 1991, Zappa was chosen to be one of four featured composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were [[John Cage]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[Alexander Knaifel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Menn| editor-first=Don|contribution=Andreas Mölich-Zebhauser—Preparing the Ensemble Modern for the Frankfurt Festival|title=Zappa!

Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also performed in 1991 in [[Prague]], claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Adieu_CA.html |title=Pražský Výběr—Adieu CA |website=Globalia.net |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UFtHqDrJ-fA|Frank Zappa Last Performance (Prague 1991)}} at 3:50&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1992, the concerts went ahead as scheduled but Zappa could only appear at two in Frankfurt due to illness. At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "[[G-Spot Tornado]]" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor [[Peter Rundel]]). Zappa received a 20-minute ovation.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer [[Louise Lecavalier]]. It was his last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} Recordings from the concerts appeared on ''[[The Yellow Shark]]'' (1993), Zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous ''[[Everything Is Healing Nicely]]'' (1999).

===Death===
Zappa died, after his long battle with prostate cancer, on December 4, 1993, 17 days before his 53rd birthday at his home with his wife and children by his side. At a private ceremony the following day, his body was buried in a grave at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], in Los Angeles. The grave is unmarked.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|552}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|379–80}} On December 6, his family publicly announced that "Composer Frank Zappa left for his final tour just before 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|320}}

===Influences===
Zappa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]]; 1950s blues artists [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Johnny Guitar Watson]], and [[B.B. King]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Guitar_Player.htm|title=Frank Zappa On&amp;nbsp;... The '80s Guitar Clone|last=Dan|first=Forte|date=January 1987|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; R&amp;B and [[doo-wop]] groups (particularly local [[pachuco]] groups); and modern jazz. His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]].&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}}{{refn|group=nb|Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs "Flower Punk" (which parodies the song "[[Hey Joe]]") and "Who Needs the Peace Corps?", which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music|edition=illustrated|first1=Virgil|last1=Moorefield |publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51405-7|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ0R4_Oxr-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.&lt;ref name="quotes"/&gt;

===Project/Object===
Zappa's albums make extensive use of [[segue]]d tracks, breaklessly joining the elements of his albums.&lt;ref name="segue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Father of Invention |first1=John |last1=Corcelli |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61713-673-3 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209 Extract of page 290]&lt;/ref&gt; His total output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; He also called it a "conceptual continuity", meaning that any project or album was part of a larger project.

===Techniques===

====Guitar playing====

Zappa is widely recognized as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of ''Guitar World'', Jon Swenson declared: "the fact of the matter is that [Zappa] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/frank-zappa-talks-gear-praises-steve-vai-his-first-guitar-world-interview-1982 |title=Frank Zappa Talks Gear, Praises Steve Vai in His First Guitar World Interview from 1982 |publisher=Guitar World |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of ''Guitar Player'' magazine wrote: "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth [[legato]] technique, while Zappa's right was "one of the fastest pick hands in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artist-lessons/1026/frank-zappa-shut-up-n-learn-his-guitar-techniques--tab--audio/56754 |title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Learn His Guitar Techniques &amp;#124; TAB + AUDIO |publisher=GuitarPlayer |date=2016-11-23 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His song "Outside Now" from ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' poked fun at the negative reception of Zappa's guitar technique by those more commercially minded, as the song's narrator lives in a world where music is outlawed and he imagines "imaginary guitar notes that would irritate/An executive kind of guy", lyrics that are followed by one of Zappa's characteristically quirky solos in 11/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Franรงois Couture |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/outside-now-mt0006332790 |title="Outside Now" – Frank Zappa &amp;#124; Song Info |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa transcriptionist Kasper Sloots wrote, "Zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (Zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right in front of an audience without knowing what the outcome will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa-analysis.com/shuttxt.htm |title=Shut up 'n play yer guitar |website=Zappa-analysis.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English guitarist and bandleader [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] opined that Zappa was "very interesting as a human being and a very interesting composer" and that he "was a very good musician but he was a dictator in his band," and that he "was taking very long guitar solos -- 10-15 minute guitar solos and really he should have taken two or three minute guitar solos, because they were a little bit boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hit-channel.com/interview-john-mclaughlin-solo-mahavishnu-orchestra-miles-davis/151278 | title=Interview: John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis) • Hit Channel| date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tape manipulation====
In New York, Zappa increasingly used [[audio engineer|tape editing]] as a compositional tool.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|160}} A prime example is found on the double album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, '' Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; where the track "King Kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts,{{refn|group=nb|In the process, he built up a vast archive of live recordings. In the late 1980s some of these recordings were collected for the 12-CD set ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore''.}} and because of his insistence on precise [[Out of tune|tuning]] and timing, he was able to augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Mix2003"&gt;
{{cite web|title=We are The Mothers&amp;nbsp;... and This Is What We Sound Like!|last=Michie|first=Chris|publisher=MixOnline.com|date=January 2003|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308055438/http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the [[tempo]] or [[Meter (music)|meter]] of the sources. He dubbed this process "[[xenochrony]]" (strange synchronizations&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marshall, "Interview with Frank Zappa", October 22, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;)—reflecting the Greek "xeno" (alien or strange) and "chronos" (time).&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Zappa was married to Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman from 1960 to 1963. In 1967, he married [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/zappa,%20frank_dc.pdf |format=PDF |title=Frank Zappa death certificate |website=Autopsyfiles.org |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rock Stars Do The Dumbest Things|first1=Margaret|last1=Moser|first2=Bill|last2=Crawford|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4299-7838-5|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC&amp;pg=PT260 Extract of page 260]&lt;/ref&gt; He and his second wife had four children: [[Moon Zappa|Moon]], [[Dweezil Zappa|Dweezil]], [[Ahmet Zappa|Ahmet]] and [[Diva Zappa|Diva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-85712-043-4|page=529|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC&amp;pg=PT529 Extract of page 529]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Zappa's death, his widow Gail created the Zappa Family Trust, which owns the rights to Zappa's music and other creative output: more than 60 albums were released during Zappa's lifetime and 40 posthumously.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-ca-ms-frank-zappa-legacy/|title=It's brother and sister against brother and sister in bitter fight over control of Frank Zappa's legacy|last=Randall Roberts|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Gail's death in October 2015, Zappa's youngest children, Ahmet and Diva, were given control of the trust with shares of 30% each, while his older children, Moon and Dweezil, were given smaller shares of 20% each.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-the-zappa-family-feud-w431684|title=Inside the Zappa Family Feud|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and politics==

===Drugs===
Zappa stated that he tried smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] approximately ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin or any of that other stuff".&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"/&gt; Zappa stated, "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |title=Interview by Bob Marshall, October 22, 1988 – Part 03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223085837/http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |archivedate=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a heavy [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoker]] for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.{{refn|group=nb|He considered such campaigns as [[yuppie]] inventions and noted that "Some people like garlic.&amp;nbsp;... I like pepper, tobacco and coffee. That's my [[metabolism]]".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|234–35}}}}

While he disapproved of drug use, he criticized the [[War on Drugs]], comparing it to [[alcohol prohibition]], and stated that the [[United States Treasury]] would benefit from the decriminalization and regulation of drugs.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|329}} Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, "I believe that people have a right to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. In a democracy, you own the government—it doesn't own you."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24, 329–30}}

===Government and religion===
[[File:Praga 7 zappa havel.jpg|left|thumb|Zappa with [[Václav Havel]], 1990]]

In a 1991 interview, Zappa reported that he was a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] but added "that might not last long—I'm going to shred that".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=XgJvMwAscO0|''web Interview with Mienfoking Films''}} (4:50)&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a "[[Conservatism in the United States|practical conservative]]".{{Refn|group=nb|"Politically, I consider myself to be a (don't laugh) 'Practical Conservative'. I want a smaller, less intrusive government, and lower taxes. What? You too?"&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315}}}} He favored [[limited government]] and low [[Taxation|taxes]]; he also stated that he approved of national defense, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24; 329–30}} He favored capitalism, [[entrepreneurship]], and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-19/business/fi-721_1_frank-zappa|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 19, 1989|title=Frank Zappa, Capitalist Rocker|author1=Apodaca, Patrice|accessdate=October 3, 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Anti-communism|opposed]] communism, stating, "A system that doesn't allow ownership&amp;nbsp;... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24, 329–30}} He had always encouraged his fans to [[Voter registration|register to vote]] on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|348}} He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|365}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge History of Social Protest in Popular Music |edition=illustrated |first1=Jonathan C. |last1=Friedman |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-136-44729-7 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC16oLUzlSIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BC16oLUzlSIC&amp;pg=PA151 Extract of page 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa was an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nugent |first=Michael |title=Famous Atheists |publisher=Michael Nugent |url=http://www.michaelnugent.com/resources/famous-atheists |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaylan|first1=Howard|last2=Tamarkin|first2=Jeff|title=Shell Shocked: My Life with the Turtles, Flo and Eddie, and Frank Zappa, etc.|year=2013|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-4803-4293-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ5OjILuPywC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=atheist|accessdate=October 21, 2014|quote=I was an atheist.

He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and [[anti-intellectualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview in Playboy|url=http://zappa.rockmetal.art.pl/wywiady/playboy.htm|publisher=Playboy|date=May 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)]], [[televangelism]], and the [[Christian Right]], and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a "fascist theocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, ''Does Humor Belong in Music?''

In early 1990, Zappa visited [[Czechoslovakia]] at the request of [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] [[Václav Havel]]. Havel designated him as Czechoslovakia's "Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism".&lt;ref name="Pompilio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pompilio|first=Natalie|title=Frank Zappa: Revolutionary|publisher=Legacy.com|date=December 4, 2013|url=http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/frank-zappa-revolutionary/1726|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Havel was a lifelong fan of Zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in Central Europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a [[The Plastic People of the Universe|Czech rock group]] that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from Zappa's 1968 song "[[Plastic People]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Tony|title=Mixing Pop and Politics: Rock Music in Czechoslovakia before and after the Velvet Revolution|journal=Popular Music.

===Anti-censorship===

Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on [[CNN|CNN's]] ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' TV series and debated issues with ''Washington Times'' commentator [[John Lofton]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="CNN TV Debate"/&gt; On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the [[United States Senate]] Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]], wife of then-senator [[Al Gore]]. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 2000, ''Censorship'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the "Blank Tape Tax." Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://urbigenous.net/library/zappa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|267}} and called their proposal for voluntary [[Parental Advisory|labelling of records]] with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|262}}

In his prepared statement, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating [[dandruff]] by [[decapitation]].&amp;nbsp;... The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain Christians do not like. What if the next bunch of Washington wives demands a [[Yellow badge|large yellow "J"]] on all material written or performed by Jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed Zionist doctrine?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/p51.html|title=Record Labeling.

Zappa set excerpts from the PMRC hearings to Synclavier music in his composition "Porn Wars" on the 1985 album ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'', and the full recording was released in 2010 as ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]'' Zappa is heard interacting with Senators [[Fritz Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=lowe194&gt;{{cite book |title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa |first1=Kelly | last1=Fisher Lowe |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8032-6005-4 |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA194 Extract of page 194]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Frank Zappa in popular culture}}

Zappa had a controversial critical standing during his lifetime. As [[Geoffrey Himes]] noted in 1993 after the artist's death, Zappa was hailed as a genius by conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and nominated by Czechoslovakian President [[Vaclav Havel]] to the country's cultural ambassadorship, but he was in his lifetime rejected twice for admission into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and been found by critics to lack emotional depth. In ''[[Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] dismissed Zappa's music as "sexist adolescent drivel ... with meters and voicings and key changes that are as hard to play as they are easy to forget."&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=December 12, 1993|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1993/12/12/pop-recordings/2e1e34bf-05aa-438b-b2c7-20f8e640600d/|title=Pop Recordings|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Himes:

{{quote|"Admirers and detractors agree that Zappa's music -- with its odd time signatures, unorthodox harmonies and fiendishly difficult lines -- boasts a rare cerebral complexity. But that's where the agreement ends. Some fans find his sophomoric jokes ("Don't Eat the Yellow Snow") and pop music parodies ("Sheik Yerbouti") a crucial counterbalance to the rarefied density of the music; other devotees find the jokes an irrelevant sideshow to music best appreciated in a chamber or orchestral setting.

''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004) writes: "Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Brackett|editor-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition|year=2004|place=New York, New York|publisher=Fireside|page=903|isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression.

In 1971, biographer David Walley noted that "The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite".&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, [[Barry Miles]] noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|383}}

In the late 1990s, American paleontologists Marc Salak and Halard L. Lescinsky discovered a [[animal|metazoan]] fossil, and named it ''Spygori zappania'' to honor "the late Frank Zappa&amp;nbsp;... whose mission paralleled that of the earliest paleontologists: to challenge conventional and traditional beliefs when such beliefs lacked roots in logic and reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spygoria zappania New Genus and Species, a Cloudina-like Biohermal Metazoan from the Lower Cambrian of Central Nevada|last=Salak|first=Marc|last2=Lescinsky|first2=Halard L.|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=73|issue=4|date=July 1999|pages=571–76|doi=10.1017/s002233600003239x|bibcode=1974JPal...48..524M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, lobbying efforts initiated by psychiatrist John Scialli led the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] to name an [[asteroid]] in Zappa's honor: [[3834 Zappafrank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seachrist|first=Lisa|title=Space Rock Gets Zappa'd|journal=Science|volume=265|issue=5174|date=August 12, 1994|page=871|doi=10.1126/science.265.5174.871-c |pmid=17782133|bibcode=1994Sci...265..871.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid was discovered in 1980 by Czechoslovakian astronomer [[Ladislav Brožek]], and the citation for its naming says that "Zappa was an eclectic, self-trained artist and composer&amp;nbsp;... Before 1989 he was regarded as a symbol of democracy and freedom by many people in Czechoslovakia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/special/rocknroll/0003834.html|title=(3834) Zappafrank|publisher=IAU: Minor Planet Center ([[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]])|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, a bust of Zappa by sculptor Konstantinas Bogdanas was installed in [[Vilnius]], the Lithuanian capital (54.683, 25.2759). The choice of Zappa was explained as "a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom."&lt;ref name="Pompilio"/&gt; A replica was offered to the city of Baltimore in 2008, and on September 19, 2010 — the twenty-fifth anniversary of Zappa's testimony to the U.S. Senate — a ceremony dedicating the replica was held, and the bust was unveiled at a library in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/entertainment/bs-ae-zappa-cover-0917-20100916_1_gail-zappa-southeast-anchor-library-lithuania|title=Zappa comes home|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/news/bs-ae-zappa-rail-0917-2-20100916_1_southeast-anchor-library-zappa-plays-zappa-zappa-related|title=Zappa-looza: A full guide to the weekend's events|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Heine''' R.S.M.A., C.S.M.A., N.W.W.S., F.C.A (July 24, 1928 – September 25, 2004) was an [[artist]] who specialized in maritime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artists in Their Studios: Where Art Is Born|first=Robert|last= Amos|publisher=	TouchWood Editions|year= 2007|ISBN=1894898583| pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Heine was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. He lived in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada until his death in 2004.

His career as an artist spanned forty years. He was a member of the [[Royal Society of Marine Artists]], to which he was elected the only Canadian member in 1980. He was a Vice President of the Canadian Society of Marine Artists and of the [[Federation of Canadian Artists]]. He was made an [[Citizenship|Honorary Citizen]] of the [[Victoria, British Columbia|City of Victoria]] in 1985 and an Honorary Alberta Artist in 1983 in recognition of his contribution to the Visual Arts. He was also a member of the Northwest Watercolour Society.

His work is in many public collections including the Legislative Buildings of the Government of [[British Columbia]]; [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] Arts Commission Collection; [[Captain Cook Birthplace Museum]], England; [[Mystic Seaport]] Museum, U.S.A.; The Provincial [[Maritime museum|Maritime Museum]], B.C.; Government House Collection, B.C.; The [[Mendel Art Gallery]], Saskatchewan; [[Art Gallery of Alberta|Edmonton Art Gallery]] and the Alberta Art Foundation.

He painted murals for Expo ’86 in Vancouver, Syncrude Canada, the [[Royal Canadian Legion]] in Edmonton and the towns of Vegreville, Fort Saskatchewan, Chemainus and Chetwynd. Painting commissions include the Canada I Society (America’s Cup), Telecom Canada, H.M.C.S. Malahat, the Government of B.C. and Beautiful ''[[British Columbia Magazine]]''. Other works range from carved murals and ship models to posters and book illustrations. He was made a Life Member of the Sail &amp; Life Training Society and the Vintage Vessel Registry.

Heine shared his techniques through demonstrations, workshops and classes throughout [[Western Canada]] and overseas as guest lecturer for P&amp;O Lines’ [[Swan Hellenic]] Cruises.  From 1986 to 2004 he conducted private painting tours to varied locales in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. His co-host on many of those trips was teacher and watercolourist, his elder daughter Caren Heine. His son Mark is an  illustrator and [[fine art]]ist and his youngest daughter Jennifer is  an artist and [[graphic design]]er. All three children have been involved in gallery exhibitions with their father, including major retrospectives held at Winchester Galleries in June 2005 and 2007. A further Canadian Legacy exhibition added a third generation, as it included photography by Sarah Heine, Mark's younger daughter. It was held in May 2017 at the MacMillan Arts Centre in Parksville, BC.

The '''hieracosphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Ιερακόσφιγξ}}) is a [[mythical beast]] found in [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] sculpture and European [[heraldry]].&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, P. Ll. (1998) ''The Art of Heraldry : origins, symbols, designs'', London : Parkgate, {{ISBN|1-85585-560-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Horus#Her-ur (Horus the Elder)|Haroeris]] ("Horus the Elder") was usually depicted as one.&lt;ref&gt;http://tarot.vn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CCI18122015_0105.png&lt;/ref&gt; The name Hieracosphinx comes from the Greek Ιερακόσφιγξ, which means Ιέραξ (Ηawk) + Σφίγξ (Sphinx).

The Hieracosphinx has the head of a [[hawk]] and the body of a [[lion]]. The name was coined by [[Herodotus]] to the hawk-headed [[Sphinx|sphinxes]] that he saw in Egypt (the other being the [[Sheep|ram]]-headed sphinx which Herodotus called [[Criosphinx]] ({{lang-grc|Κριόσφιγξ}})).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Leontophone''' (Leontophonos, Leophontes) is a small animal from [[Bestiary|Medieval bestiaries]] that is deadly to lions. To kill a [[lion]], the lion need only bite the leontophone. Though, in a proper ritual, the leontophone's [[flesh]] is burned and its ashes are sprinkled on a piece of meat, which is placed at a [[Intersection (road)|crossroad]]; if a lion eats even a small amount of the tainted meat, it dies. The ancients considered this method a 'happy arrangement', since both lions and leontophones die in the process; from this, one can safely assume that not only were lions considered [[Risk|dangerous]], but leontophones may have been considered [[pest (organism)|pests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LU6oFxvVoe8C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=leontophonos+happy+arrangement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OxWWmPXD7n&amp;sig=SqB5fcV2zdh6Q8vwO4eGRw7WJF8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5eRlUNedA5Lm8wTrioHwBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=leontophonos%20happy%20arrangement&amp;f=false|title= Leontophone|accessdate=2012-09-28|work= Natural History, Lore and Legend by Frederick Edward Hulme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, due to the danger they pose to lions, [[lion]]s instinctively hate leontophones. Confronted by a leontophone, they often hunt and kill them, tearing them apart with their claws rather than biting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast4410.htm|title=Leontophone|accessdate=2008-12-28|work=[http://bestiary.ca/ The Medieval Bestiary]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some sources state that the lion will instead flee from the small creature, only attacking and killing it when left with no option to flee (since attacking the leontophone may cause it to urinate, and the urine of the leontophone is ''also'' fatally [[poison]]ous to lions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=leontophonos+lion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DA37e75gmp&amp;sig=iVAeB3WF0Y_QPk3BoR1Y1Y65I0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jN1lUPLZMYGW8gSK9IDQBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=leontophonos%20lionf=false|title= Leontophone|accessdate=2012-09-28|work=Animal and Man in Bible Lands, Volume 1 By Friedrich Simon Bodenheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no sources give a definite depiction of the leontophone's appearance, some sources speculate that the creature looks like a small [[boar]] or a small [[bear]], while others speculate that it is serpentine (with some referring to it even as a small 'worm', the medieval term for a [[dragon]]).

This soundtrack contains background music and a few theme songs from the first Area of the original ''EXE'' series. Although the soundtrack's title implies a second Sound Navigation may have been released, one was never announced, possibly due to poor sales.

However, most of the songs are in their broadcast ''TV-Sized'' lengths, presumably because full-length versions were never recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/detail.asp?goods=CPCA000010183|title=Sony Music Shop Product Listing|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maqbool Fida Husain''' (17 September 1915&amp;nbsp;– 9 June 2011)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.culturalindia.net/indian-art/painters/m-f-hussain.html, also , India's Most Famous Painter, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2011|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a modern [[Indian people|Indian]] painter of international acclaim, and a founding member of [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]].

Husain is associated with Indian [[modernism]] in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the "new" India after [[Partition of India|The Partition]] of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified [[Cubist]] style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—include topics as diverse as [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Mother Teresa]], the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]], the [[British raj]], and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. Early in his painting career, and until his death, he enjoyed depicting the lively and free spirit of horses in many of his works.Husain is the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artist of the 20th century. Husain is primarily known for his paintings, but is also known for his drawings and his work as a printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker. Some of his later works stirred controversy, as they depicted traditional deities of India in non-traditional ways including nude portrayals of the deities.

He also directed a few movies. In 1967, he received the [[Discontinued and Intermittent National Film Awards|National Film Award for Best Experimental Film]] for ''Through the Eyes of a Painter''.&lt;ref name="15thaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/15th_nff_1967.pdf|title=15th National Film Awards|publisher=[[International Film Festival of India]]|accessdate=21 September 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he directed ''[[Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities]]'', a film he worked on with his artist son [[Owais Husain]], which was screened in the Marché du Film section of the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/Meenaxi-Tale-of-3-cities-screened-at-Cannes/223181|title=Meenaxi: Tale of 3 cities screened at Cannes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Husain was born on 17 September 1915 in [[Pandharpur]] to a [[Sulaymani]] Bohra family who trace their roots back to [[Gujarat]] within the last 200 years, and then originally to Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caravanmagazine.in/essay/understanding-husain|title=Understanding Husain|date=3 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up taste in art through studying calligraphy while he stayed at a Madraasa in [[Baroda]].&lt;ref name=gulf2/&gt; Husain attended the [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar |first1=Anu |title=JJ Institute: 150 years of lettering the poor |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990109/00950535.html |work=Indian Express |date=9 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526071758/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990109/00950535.html |archivedate=26 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai. To earn extra money, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often travelled to Gujarat to paint landscapes when he could afford to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webindia123.com/personal/paint/husain.htm|title=MF Husain|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=Web India}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/arts/design/m-f-husains-modern-india-at-the-art-institute-of-chicago.html|title=M.

The artists cite "The Partition" of India and Pakistan 14 August 1947, with its resulting religious rioting and heavy loss of life as their reason for forming The Progressive Artist's Group in Bombay in December 1947. The artists saw the Partition as a "turning point" for India, and their new style of art was urged on by, and was also a turning point for, (modern) Indian Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=progressive-artists-group-of-bombay-an-overview&amp;iid=29&amp;articleid=800|title=Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview|website=www.artnewsnviews.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husain's first solo exhibit was in 1952 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="contemporaryindianart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryindianart.com/m_f_husain.htm|title=M.F.

===1990 – 2005===
His paintings allegedly hurt the religious sentiments of [[Hindutva#Cultural nationalism|Hindu nationalist groups]], which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of protest against him.&lt;ref name=nytimesmfdies&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/arts/design/maqbool-fida-husain-indias-most-famous-painter-dies-at-95.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=Maqbool Fida Husain, also , India's Most Famous Painter, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2011|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in ''Vichar Mimansa'', a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined "M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher".&lt;ref name=nytimesmfdies/&gt; In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, [[Delhi High Court]] dismissed these complaints of "promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindu fundamentalist groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi HC dismisses complaints against M.F.

In 1998 Husain's house was attacked by Hindu fundamentalist groups like [[Bajrang Dal]] and art works were vandalised. The leadership of another fundamentalist political party [[Shiv Sena]] endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=R.|title=Assault on art|url=http://frontlineonnet.com/fl1510/15100210.htm|newspaper=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|date=9–22 May 1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714034825/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1510/15100210.htm|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in England.

He has also produced &amp; directed several movies, including ''[[Gaja Gamini]]'' (2000) (with his [[Artistic inspiration|muse]] [[Madhuri Dixit]] who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed ''Fida''). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself.&lt;ref name="muse"&gt;{{cite web|title=youtube.com|work=The work of the muse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aOqSTkZw7I|accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2013}} In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of [[Kalidasa]], the [[Mona Lisa]], a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film ''[[Mohabbat (1997 film)|Mohabbat]]'', which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/168469/reema-nath-made-husain-act.html |title=Reema Nath made Husain act in 'Mohabbat' |newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=13 June 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make ''[[Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities]]'' (with [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Shiv|title=Husain pulls Meenaxi out of theatres|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040417/nation.htm#8|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=16 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All-India Ulema Council complained that the [[Qawwali]] song ''[[Meenaxi (Soundtrack)|Noor-un-Ala-Noor]]'' was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards.

===2006 - 2011===
In February 2006, Husain was charged with "hurting sentiments of people" because of his nude portraits of [[Hindu deities|Hindu gods and goddesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M F Husain booked for his paintings of nude gods|url=http://ia.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/07nude.htm|publisher=[[Rediff]]|date=7 February 2006|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 6 February 2006 issue, ''[[India Today]]'', a national English weekly published an advertisement titled "Art For Mission Kashmir". This advertisement contains a painting of {Bharatmata} (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by [[Nafisa Ali]] of Action India (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organizations like [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) have protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologized and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, which was later sold for Rs 80 lakh in the auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MF Hussain apologises for obscene paintings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-02-07/india/27814790_1_hjs-m-f-hussain-noted-painter|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=7 February 2006|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HJS lodges FIR against Nafisa Ali for selling Hussain's art|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=354472|newspaper=[[Outlook India]]|date=10 February 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204065111/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=354472|archivedate=4 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting later appeared on Husain's official website.

At the age of 92 Husain was given the prestigious [[Raja Ravi Varma]] award by the government of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MF Husain selected for Raja Ravi Varma award|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/MF-Hussain-selected-for-Raja-Ravi-Varma-award/Article1-222279.aspx|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=12 May 2007|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307124948/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/MF-Hussain-selected-for-Raja-Ravi-Varma-award/Article1-222279.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement led to controversy in Kerala and some cultural organisations campaigned against the granting of the award and petitioned the Kerala courts. Social Activist, [[Rahul Easwar]], went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/14/stories/2007091460170400.htm |title=High Court restraint on award for M.F.

In 2010, the Jordanian [[Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre]] named Husain as one of the 500 most influential Muslims.&lt;ref name="InflMusl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rissc.jo/docs/0A-FullVersion-LowRes.pdf | title=The 500 Most Influential Muslims|publisher=The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre | accessdate=3 January 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M F Husain Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of M. F. Husain in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]].]]
M. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's most highly prized artist MF Husain dies aged 95|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13708844|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the [[Royal Brompton Hospital]] in London, and was buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] on 10 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/06/09/mf-husain-dies-%E2%80%93-lauded-in-exile-by-india%E2%80%99s-artistic-fraternity/|first=John|last=Elliott|title=MF Husain dies – lauded in exile by India's artistic fraternity|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418054453/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/06/09/mf-husain-dies-%E2%80%93-lauded-in-exile-by-india%E2%80%99s-artistic-fraternity/|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Indian artists expressed criticism. [[Satish Gujral]] publicly asked Husain whether he would dare to portray Islamic figures similarly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brush with genius|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nm17/A-brush-with-genius/Article1-153431.aspx|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=24 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022035103/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nm17/A-brush-with-genius/Article1-153431.aspx|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed "the mob culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta |first=Shekar |title=On the record: 'Husain's exile makes me ashamed of my culture. . . the state hasn't expelled him, mob culture has' |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/293365-3.html |newspaper=[[Indian Express]] |date=7 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511140359/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/293365-3.html |archivedate=11 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Pioneer (daily)|The Pioneer]]'', Chandan Mitra wrote, "As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Husain's objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitra |first=Chandan |title=Art for God's sake |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&amp;file_name=mitra%2Fmitra250.txt&amp;writer=mitra |accessdate=27 September 2007 |newspaper=[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035639/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&amp;file_name=mitra%2Fmitra250.txt&amp;writer=mitra |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the controversy, Husain's admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest award. According to [[Shashi Tharoor]], who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his "life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tharoor|first=Shashi|title=Our stories|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/11/26/stories/2006112600090300.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 November 2006|authorlink=Shashi Tharoor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his part Husain stated that leading Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice and only people with political intentions created controversy.&lt;ref name=gulf2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=365512&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |title=I just want to work in peace, says Husain |first=Nahla |last=Nainar |newspaper=[[Gulf Times]] |date=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607131252/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=365512&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |archivedate=7 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Husain's death, Shiv Sena chief [[Bal Thackeray]] said, "He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Husain only 'slipped up' on depiction of Hindu gods: Bal Thackeray|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2091454.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Ambarish|title=Gave up the country, not his obduracy|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-10/india/29642114_1_m-f-husain-sena-leader-raj-thackeray|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 June 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bal Thackeray: MF Husain 'slipped'; Raj: Time to put controversies behind|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_bal-thackeray-m-f-husain-slipped-raj-time-to-put-controversies-behind_1552998|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=9 June 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIDAS Heritage''' ''– the UK Historic Environment Data Standard'' is a British [[cultural heritage]] standard for recording information on buildings, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, parks and gardens, battlefields, areas of interest and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers UK (ALGAO). Data Standards.  {{cite web|url=http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820014333/http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data standard suggests the minimum level of information needed for recording heritage assets and covers the procedures involved in understanding, protecting and managing these assets. It also provides guidelines on how to support effective sharing of knowledge, [[data retrieval]] and long-term preservation of data.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''MIDAS Heritage'' is freely available to anyone interested in recording historic environment information. It is used by national government organisations, local authorities, heritage sector organisations, amenity groups and societies, the research community and professional contractors.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the standard, ''MIDAS – A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories'', was published by the ''[[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Lee, E., (ed), MIDAS - A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories. The Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England. Swindon (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; (RCHME) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;the Data Hub – The easy way to get, use and share data. (MIDAS – Heritage project) http://ckan.net/dataset/midas-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation merged with ''[[English Heritage]]'' in 1999 and the updated version, ''MIDAS Heritage'', was published in 2007 in collaboration with other UK heritage organisations. The standard was developed by the ''Forum on Information Standards in Heritage'' (FISH), a discussion forum aimed at helping to resolve standards and recording issues for the whole of the heritage sector.&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised version, with more explicit compliance statements, was released in 2012 &lt;https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/midas-heritage/midas-heritage-2012-v1_1.pdf/&gt;

==Coverage==
''MIDAS Heritage'' is a set of closely integrated data standards, rather than one single standard.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with separate standards covering specific types of applications or projects, which will give the necessary [[data element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''SPECTRUM'' (artefacts), ''UK Gemini Discovery Metadata Standard'' (GIS), ''[[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]]'' (concepts and relationships),&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization. ISO 21127:2006 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34424&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records’’.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, P; Newman, M. (2007): “Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records”. 2nd edition.  http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/ifp/ &lt;/ref&gt; MIDAS Heritage complies with the UK e-Government Metadata Standard ([[e-GMS]]),&lt;ref&gt;esd standards, e-GMS-e-Government Metadata Standard, Version 3.0, {{cite web|url=http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118112837/http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard aims only to provide a common information framework and does not cover: what software or file format to use; what to call fields and tables in a database and how they are designed; what indexing terms to use; how to record archives and museum collections, or how to redesign an existing information system.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard.

Next, ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/upload/docs/PRESSKIT%20CHASING%20NAPOLEON.pdf Chasing Napoleon]'' (2009-2010) examined the notion of disappearance.

In 2011, Wahler curated ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512134110/http://www.dynasty-expo.com/d/en/ Dynasty]'' with Fabrice Hergott, the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art, Paris]]. They exhibited a total of 80 works from 40 French artists under the age of 35 in both the Palais de Tokyo and the Museum of Modern Art, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/the-market/2010-06-29/dynasty-palais-de-tokyo-musee-dart-moderne/print/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Dynasty'', Wahler created the ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/fo3/low/programme/index.php?page=projets.php&amp;cat2=3 Modules]'', a series of art exhibits which focused on emergent artists. He also created the "Carte Blanche", a still ongoing series which give an artist the opportunity to present a special project covering the entirety of the exhibition space of Palais de Tokyo and offering a kind of map of the artist’s brain, desires and influences. 
A review noted that "under Mr. Wahler, the Palais de Tokyo has become one of the city’s best springboards for young artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|date=October 28, 2011|title=Paris Regains Some of Its Lost Aura in Art World|author=Nicolai Hartvig|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/arts/29iht-scparis29.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahler is also known for adding a rooftop hotel and a rooftop restaurant, to the already existent bookstore and restaurant Tokyo-eat.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite its bourgeois address in the 16th Arrondissement, the Palais de Tokyo is the coolest museum in Paris: risk-taking, roomy and a little rough around the edges" (T Magazine, July 2, 2009). http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/paris-communal-art-meets-dinner-at-the-palais-de-tokyo/&lt;/ref&gt; He installed the [[Lang and Baumann]] artist project [[Everland Hotel]] (a one-room hotel room available to the public) on the museum's roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/the-post-materialist-paris-reborn/ | work=The New York Times | first=Nick | last=Currie | title=The Post-Materialist &amp;#124; Paris Reborn | date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahler removed Everland after a year and replaced it with [[Laurent Grasso]]'s artist project [http://www.nomiya.org/ Nomiya], a one-room restaurant for 12 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wallpaper.com/travel/fab-40-nomiya-restaurant-paris/3934&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalet Society, Paris===
Wahler is the founder and director of a new structure, [http://www.chaletsociety.org The Chalet Society], designed to encourage reflection on contemporary art institutions and to investigate new possibilities for exhibitions by testing forms, spaces, discourses, and protocols. The mobile structure endeavors to develop formats that work on a variety of platforms, similar to open source software that can run on any hardware.
The Chalet Society reacts to the boldest artistic settings and acts itself as a community of artists, collectors, researchers, and other enthusiasts, searching for “poetic consciousness,” an idea attributed to Saul Wahl Katzenellenbogen - crowned King of Poland in 1587. He only reigned for one night but had enough time to pronounce a number of predictions and appeal for the dawn of “poetic consciousness.”

Launched in October 2012 in a pop-up site – a disused school in the heart of Paris – the Chalet Society presented a variety of extraordinary self-taught or unknown artists in collaboration with the Museum of Everything.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/2290/The_Chalet_Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Obscurity to the Center of the City of Light|author=Matthew Rose|date=November 17, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|page=C22|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324439804578115121120184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having tested the limits of the commonly accepted notion of artist, the Chalet Society created the “Tester’s Salon” in the summer of 2013, a project by the art critic Christophe Kihm and the artists Arnaud and Bertrand Dezoteux. Here more than 40 artists were invited to reflect on testing an extensive range of exhibition formats.

In fall 2013 after the self-taught ‘outsider’ artists, the exhibition ''The Hidden World'', designed by the artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]], focused on artists who – while producing for specific commissions – have often got lost behind their intentions. Shaw collected over the past 40 years diverse didactic material, creating “a breathtaking and expansive journey through the myths and beliefs of America.”&lt;ref&gt;Maaike Lauwaert, Artforum, December 2013. http://www.artforum.com/archive/id=44209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Curator / writer===

[[File:Matusevitch self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Matusevitch's self portrait]]

'''Michael Matusevitch''' was a painter (1929 - 2007). He was born in [[Odessa]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] ([[Ukraine]] in nowadays). 
Matusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter.

==Wartime==
In [[1941]], Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents{{where|date=November 2018}}. After two weeks, war{{clarify|date=November 2018}} broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in [[Odessa]], resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the [[Nazism|Nazis]], making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg.

In the end, the group reached [[Tadzhikistan]] in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. 
Matusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. 
Matusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house.

==Odessa==
At the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. 
Matusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the [[Grekov Odessa Art school]].
At the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. 
Matusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the [[Red Army]]. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions.

==Study==
In 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the [[Socialist Realism]] mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. 
[[Modern art]] was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable.

In 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.”

==Influential painter==
An important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]]. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in [[Moscow]] from the [[Netherlands]], Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting. 

In 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” 
Subsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, [[Sasha Richter]].

==Israel==
In 1974, he arrived in [[Israel]] and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“
Matusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists.

In 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in [[Tel Aviv|Tel-Aviv]]. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch.  

==Death and legacy==
Matusevitch passed away in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much.

In 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an [https://www.matusevitchart.com online gallery], together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - [https://www.matusevitchart.com].  It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family.

The book is about the author's 10-year-old daughter Annabel Beam, who was diagnosed with a rare terminal stomach disorder. While on a visit home from the hospital she fell while climbing a tree with her older sister, a branch gave way sending Annabel 30 feet down headfirst into the hollow trunk of a cottonwood tree. She was inside the trunk of the tree for several hours where she visits with Jesus who tells her she will be fine. She is finally rescued and taken to a hospital. She woke up at the hospital without any broken bones or internal injuries.

'''Obverse''' and its [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]], '''reverse''', refer to the two flat faces of [[coin]]s and some other two-sided objects, including [[Currency#Paper money|paper money]], [[flag terminology|flags]], [[seal (emblem)|seals]], [[medal]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[old master print]]s and other works of art, and printed fabrics. In this usage, ''obverse'' means the [[wikt:front|front]] face of the object and ''reverse'' means the [[wikt:back|back]] face. The obverse of a coin is commonly called ''heads'', because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse ''tails''.

In fields of [[scholarly method|scholarship]] outside [[numismatics]], the term ''front'' is more commonly used than ''obverse'', while usage of ''reverse'' is widespread.

The equivalent terms used in [[codicology]], [[manuscript]] studies, [[printmaking|print]] studies and [[publishing]] are [[recto and verso|"recto" and "verso"]].

[[Image:Tetradrachma från Aten (omkr 490 fKr, ur Nordisk familjebok).png|thumb|On a Tetradrachma of Athens, struck {{circa|lk=no|490 BC}}, the head of [[Athena]], ''(left)'', is regarded as the obverse because of its larger scale and because it is a portrait head; the entire owl is depicted in a smaller scale on the reverse.]]
Generally, the side of a coin with the larger-scale image will be called the obverse (especially if the image is a single head) and, if that does not serve to distinguish them, the side that is more typical of a wide range of coins from that location will be called the obverse. Following this principle, in the most famous of [[Ancient Greek coinage|ancient Greek coins]], the [[tetradrachm]] of Athens, the obverse is the head of [[Athena]] and the reverse is her owl.  Similar versions of these two images, both symbols of the state, were used on the Athenian coins for more than two centuries.

In the many republics of ancient Greece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient-greece.org/|title=Ancient Greece|first=Thomas|last=Sakoulas|website=www.ancient-greece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Athens or [[Corinth]], one side of their coins would have a symbol of the state, usually their patron goddess or her symbol, which remained constant through all of the coins minted by that state, which is regarded as the obverse of those coins. The opposite side may have varied from time to time. In ancient Greek monarchical coinage, the situation continued whereby a larger image of a [[deity]], is called the obverse, but a smaller image of a monarch appears on the other side which is called the reverse.

[[Image:Tetradrachme.wmt.jpg|thumb|Obverse of the tetradrachm of [[Alexander the Great]], intended to be seen as a deity, wearing the attributes of the hero, [[Heracles]]/[[Hercules]]. 325{{nbsp}}BC.]]
In a [[Western world|Western]] [[monarchy]], it has been customary, following the tradition of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic monarchs]] and then the [[Roman emperor]]s, for the currency to bear the head of the monarch on one side, which is almost always regarded as the obverse. This change happened in the coinage of [[Alexander the Great]], which continued to be minted long after his death. After his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]], he allowed himself to be depicted on the obverse of coins as a [[god-king]], at least partly because he thought this would help secure the allegiance of the Egyptians, who had regarded their previous monarchs, the [[pharaoh]]s, as divine.  The various Hellenistic rulers who were his successors followed his tradition and kept their images on the obverse of coins.

[[Image:Solidus-Justinian II-Christ b-sb1413.jpg|thumb|left|''Solidus'' of [[Justinian II]] after 705. Christ is on the obverse (''left''), the emperor on the reverse.]]
A movement back to the earlier tradition of a deity being placed on the obverse occurred in [[Byzantine coinage]], where a head of Christ became the obverse and a head or portrait (half or full-length) of the emperor became considered the reverse. The introduction of this style in the gold coins of [[Justinian II]] from the year 695 provoked the Islamic [[Caliph]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], who previously had copied Byzantine designs, replacing Christian symbols with [[Islam]]ic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive ''Islamic style'', with just lettering on both sides of their coins. This script alone style then was used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period.  The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of [[Iconoclasm]], and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire. Without images, therefore, it is not always easy to tell which side will be regarded as the obverse without some knowledge.

[[Image:Silver Rupee Madras Presidency.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Silver [[rupee]] using [[Mughal era|Mughal]] conventions, but minted by the [[British East India Company]] [[Madras]] Presidency between 1817 and 1835. On rupees, the side that carries the name of the ruler is considered the obverse.]]

After 695 Islamic coins avoided all images of persons and usually contained script alone. The side expressing the [[Six Kalimas]] (the Islamic profession of faith) is usually defined as the obverse.

A [[Convention (norm)|convention]] exists typically to display the obverse to the left (or above) and the reverse to the right (or below) in photographs and museum displays, but this is not invariably observed.

==Modern coins==
The [[form follows function|form]] of [[currency]] follows its function, which is to serve as a readily accepted [[medium of exchange]] of [[Value (economics)|value]].  Normally, this function rests on a [[Sovereign state|state]] as guarantor of the value: either as ''trustworthy'' guarantor of the kind and amount of [[metal]] in a [[coin]], or as ''powerful'' guarantor of the continuing acceptance of [[token coin]]s.

Traditionally, most states have been [[monarchy|monarchies]] where the person of the [[monarch]] and the state were equivalent for most purposes. For this reason, the ''obverse'' side of a modern piece of currency is the one that evokes that reaction by invoking the strength of the state, and that side almost always depicts a [[symbol]] of the state, whether it be the monarch or otherwise.

If not provided for on the obverse, the reverse side usually contains information relating to a coin's role as medium of exchange (such as the value of the coin). Additional space typically reflects the issuing country's culture or government, or evokes some aspect of the state's territory.

==Specific currencies==

===Coins of the European Union===
[[Image:N22978 2 eur aversas.jpg|thumb|100px|National side (obverse) of a Lithuanian 2€ coin]]
Regarding the [[euro]], some confusion regarding the obverse and reverse of the [[euro coins]] exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, and despite the fact that a number of countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the ''obverse'' and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the ''reverse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:264:0038:0039:EN:PDF Commission Recommendation of 29 September 2003 on a common practice for changes to the design of national obverse sides of euro circulation coins] (PDF), [[Official Journal of the European Union|OJ]] L&amp;nbsp;264, 2003-10-15, pp. 38–39; EU doc. nr. C(2003) 3388.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they do not have a common side.

A number of the designs used for obverse national sides of [[euro coins]] were taken from the reverse of the nations' former pre-euro coins. Several countries (such as [[Spain]] and [[Belgium]]) continue to use portraits of the reigning monarch; while the [[Coins of the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] continues to use the State Arms, as on its earlier issues.

===Coins of Japan===
[[Image:500JPY.JPG|thumb|200px|¥500 coin, the obverse showing a [[Paulownia]] plant, the reverse showing the value "500", and the year 2006 (平成十八年, ''[[heisei]] juu-hachi nen'')]]
In Japan, from 1897 to the end of [[World War II]], the following informal conventions existed:
*the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] (or Chrysanthemum Crest), representing the imperial family, appeared on all coins, and this side was regarded as the obverse;
*the other side, on which the date appeared, was regarded as the reverse.

The Chrysanthemum Crest was no longer used after the war, and so (equally informally):
*the side on which the date appears continues to be regarded as the reverse;
*the side without the date is regarded as the obverse.

===Coins of the United Kingdom===
[[Image:EdwardVIIIcoin.jpg|thumb|150px|A left-facing portrait of Edward VIII would have broken tradition.]]
Following ancient tradition, the obverse of coins of the [[United Kingdom]] (and predecessor kingdoms going back to the [[middle ages]]) almost always feature the head of the monarch.

By tradition, each British monarch faces in the opposite direction of his or her predecessor; this is said to date from 1661, with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] turning his back on [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Hence, [[George VI]] faced left and the present [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] faces right. The only break in this tradition almost occurred in 1936 when [[Edward VIII]], believing his left side to be superior to his right, insisted on his image facing left, as his father's image had. No official legislation prevented his wishes being granted, so left-facing obverses were prepared for minting. Very few examples were struck before he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later that year, but none bearing this portrait ever were issued officially. When George VI acceded to the throne, his image was placed to face left, implying that, had any coins been minted with Edward's portrait the obverses would have depicted Edward facing right and maintained the tradition.

Current UK coinage features the following abbreviated Latin inscription: D(ei) G(ratia) REG(ina) F(idei) D(efensor) (''[[By the Grace of God]], Queen [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]''). Earlier issues, before 1954, included BRITT(anniarum) OMN(ium) (''of all the Britains''{{snd}}that is, Britain and its dominions) and before 1949 IND(iae) IMP(erator) (''[[Emperor of India]]'').

===Coins of the United States===
The United States specifies what appears on the obverse and reverse of its currency. The specifications mentioned here imply the use of all upper-case letters, although they appear here in upper and lower case letters for the [[Typography|legibility]] of the article.

[[Image:1 us dollar 1979.jpg|thumb|200px|US dollar coin, with the obverse side showing [[Susan B. Anthony]], the words "Liberty" and "In God We Trust", and the year 1979; the reverse side shows the words "One Dollar", "United States of America", and "E Pluribus Unum", and an [[eagle]] carrying a laurel branch.]]
The [[United States government]] long adhered to including all of the following:
*Obverse:
**"[[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]"
**"[[In God We Trust]]"
** The four digits of a year, that of minting or issue
*Reverse:
**"United States of America"
**"''[[E Pluribus Unum]]''"
**Words (not digits) expressing the name or assigned value of the item, e.g., "Quarter Dollar", "One Dime", "Five Cents"

The ten-year series of [[State Quarters|Statehood Quarters]], whose issue began in 1999, was seen as calling for more space and more flexibility in the design of the reverse.{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=The series was seen as calling for something? That doesn't make a lot of sense, at least to a non-expert.}} A law specific to this series and the corresponding time period permits the following:
*Obverse:
**as before:
***"Liberty"
***"[[In God We Trust]]"
**instead of on the reverse:
***"United States of America"
***The words expressing assigned value of the coin, "Quarter Dollar"
*Reverse:
**as before:
***"[[E Pluribus Unum]]"
**instead of on the obverse:
***The four digits of the year of issue

The '''Palestine Poster Project Archives''' (PPPA) was founded as a means of collecting and digitally displaying a wide variety of works in the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] [[poster]] genre.  The Palestine poster genre is more than a century old and growing. The Palestine Poster Project Archives continues to expand as the largest online collection of such posters.

A majority of the works included in this archives are created by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] artists, although the collection also features many works created by [[international]], [[Zionist]], and [[Israelis|Israeli]] artists.  More than 8,600 posters created by at least 1,750 artists are currently available on the Palestine Poster Project Archives’ website for public viewing.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/|title=Palestine Poster Project Archives: Official Website|publisher=Liberation Graphics|accessdate=2013-05-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As a [[Peace Corps]] volunteer in [[Morocco]] during the 1970s, Dan Walsh began a lifelong hobby of collecting Palestinian posters, the majority of which dealt with the theme of [[nationalism]].  Walsh initially received support from Dr. [[Edward Said]] through the American Palestine Education Foundation to transform his hobby into a public archive.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSdF21WB-U|title= 'The Palestine Poster: A Pixel is Worth a Thousand Verbs' by Dan Walsh|publisher=Columbia University, Center for Palestine Studies|date=2010-12-02|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, Walsh founded the Palestine Poster Project Archives, an online public database that is frequently updated.  He continues to avidly collect, document, and archive Palestinian posters from across the world today.

The Palestine Poster Project Archives was a key component of Walsh’s thesis as a student in [[Georgetown University]]’s Master of Arts in Arab Studies program at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.  This database was originally created for [[historians]], [[educators]], and advocates of [[public diplomacy]].

==Definition==
The Palestine poster genre dates back to the late nineteenth century. The Palestine Poster Project Archives entails that a poster with any of the following elements can be classified as a "Palestine poster":

* Any poster with the word "Palestine" in it, in any language, from any source or time period.
* Any poster created or published by any artist or agency claiming Palestinian nationality or Palestinian participation.
* Any poster published in the geographical territory of historic Palestine, at any point in history, including contemporary Israel.
* Any poster published by any source that relates directly to the social, cultural, political, military or economic history of Palestine.
* Any poster related to Zionism or anti-Zionism in any language, from any source, published after August 31, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Palestine Poster Project Archives|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/content/about-the-palestine-poster-project-archives|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Some of the earliest posters produced about Palestine were made by tourist companies in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, [[Zionist]] groups started making posters encouraging [[Jewish]] groups to immigrate to historic Palestine and urging international support for a Jewish state. In 1897, at the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Switzerland]], attendants decided to adopt poster production as a significant resource to communicate and disseminate information. Intense production of Zionist posters continued for about fifty years, after which it waned.

When Palestinians experienced mass dislocation and exile in 1948, a series of events referred to as the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]], known in Arabic as ''al-Nakba'' ("the Catastrophe"), some prominent artists in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and other [[Arab countries]] began producing posters to convey support for a [[Palestinian state]].  According to Dan Walsh, founder of the Palestinian Poster Project Archives, as a result of the [[Battle of Karameh]] ([[Jordan]]) in 1968, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] began to more seriously consider the importance of [[international solidarity]] and information production and dissemination.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;

The [[PLO]] supported a particular style of Palestinian visual arts, leading to the rise of pamphleteer art and nationalist paintings that employed iconic imagery, symbols, and slogans for the Palestinian struggle.&lt;ref name="nadir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/rev_linke/sanat/jihad/jihad.htm |title=Interview with 'Jihad Mansour' (Marc Rudin) |publisher=Nadir.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian poster was seen as an especially useful medium for generating solidarity, representing narratives, and even mediating internal disagreements in Palestinian society.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;  By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the production of Palestinian nationalist posters was prolific.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boullatta&gt;{{cite book|last=Boullatta |first=Kamal|title=Artists Remember Palestine in Beirut |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, there were few major professional institutions or gallery spaces available to display work in the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name=Boullatta /&gt;{{rp|74}} Therefore, artists often hung their posters in [[schools]], [[town halls]], union offices, [[public libraries]], and other shared public spaces. Artist Marc Rudin explained, "The posters had to be designed to be posted in the [[refugee camps]], in its narrow alleys, in Palestinian homes. But they were also to be used for information campaigns abroad".&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt; Artists designed their posters to be aesthetically pleasing, meaningful, and in many cases, communicative for both the Palestinian public and an international audience. Many Palestinian nationalist posters were displayed not only in public spaces in Palestinian towns and cities, but also in major urban spaces and capital cities throughout the [[Arab world]] and [[Europe]].

Documentation of the Palestinian nationalist posters genre's evolution was fragmented, and at times violently interrupted, in the mid and late twentieth century. Ezzedin Kalak, the PLO's representative in [[France]], was collecting hundreds of [[posters]] and [[postcard]]s for a book about the significance of Palestinian posters when he was [[assassinated]] by the [[Israel]]i national intelligence agency ([[Mossad]]) in 1978. Kalak's project was never completed or published.

Palestine poster artists continue to contribute works to the ever-growing genre today. The majority of posters displayed in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are originally printed on paper. From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, most Palestine posters were printed in a single location and then distributed worldwide. Increased [[internet access]] in the Arab world and globally, in tandem with rising costs for print production en masse, has led many Palestine poster artists to localize printing operations rather than utilize large and centralized printing companies.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; An increasing number of new Palestine posters are being created digitally and then printed and distributed locally.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Organization of posters==
The PPPA works are organized under various subcategories to ease a user's search.  The "Special Categories" include a section entitled "Artists and Collectives" where some of the most prolific artists' works are gathered.  Other sections under "Special Categories" include "Exhibits and Catalogs;" "Historical Figures and Themes;" "Political, Cultural, and Social Publishers;" and "Museums, Libraries, Private Collections, Universities, and Archives."

The PPPA also has a section entitled "Iconography" under which 40 types of reoccurring imagery, symbols, and representation are categorized.  Some of these categories include "[[woman]]/female," "[[stone]]," "[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] flag," and "[[olives]]/[[trees]]/[[branches]]."

==Artists==
According to Walsh, works featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives can be divided into four major “wellsprings” or origins: Israeli and Zionist artists and agencies, Palestinian nationalist artists and agencies, [[Muslim]] and Arab artists and agencies, and international artists and agencies.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;

Some artists featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are not Palestinian, [[Jewish]], or [[Israelis|Israeli]] by origin.  The Palestine Poster Project Archives currently holds posters made by artists from more than 55 countries.  For example, Marc Rudin, a Swiss-born artist with no Arab or Palestinian ancestry, worked as a graphic artist for the PLO between 1980 and 1991.&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt;  During that time, he went by the [[pseudonym]] Jihad Mansour.  Rudin produced nearly 200 posters about Palestine and worked most closely with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt;  

Some Palestinian poster artists are [[Arab people|Arab]] by descent, but not Palestinian.  For instance, artist Burhan Karkoutly was Syrian by birth and created numerous posters for the PLO during the 1970s.  Due to his commitment to and understanding of the Palestinian cause, Karkoutly was considered as one of the leading “Palestinian artists” of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sabella|first=Steve|title=Reconsidering the Value of Palestinian Art and its Journey in to the Art Market
|year=2009|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Dan Walsh, the founder of the Palestine Poster Project Archives, originally envisioned that the archive would be useful for American high school educators teaching the history of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/sites/aod/files/thesis_daniel_j_walsh-1_0.pdf|title=The Palestine Poster Project Archives: Origins, Evolution, and Potential|publisher=Dan Walsh|date=2011-12-19|accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives could be incorporated into curricula for [[visual anthropology]], [[art history]], [[media studies]], [[graphic design]], and a variety of other subjects.  Dan Walsh said in an interview with [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al-Akhbar]] English: "There are two [[narratives]] presented at my website, the Palestinian nationalist and the political Zionist, and they've never been put together like this before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/palestine-poster-project-virtual-memory-struggle-and-everyday|title=The Palestine Poster Project: A Virtual Memory of Struggle and the Everyday|publisher=Leah Caldwell from Al-Akhbar English|date=2001-12-06|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestine Poster Project Archives provides some context about the production of each poster, which typically includes the date that it was printed, the organization for which it was commissioned, and the artist's name. Sometimes information about the poster’s dimensions (size) and medium are also included. Many of the posters with [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] text have been translated into [[English language|English]].

==Presentations==
In June 2012, the Palestinian American Research Center (PARC) sponsored Dan Walsh to present the Palestine Poster Project Archives in cities across the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://parc-us-pal.org/conferences.htm|title= Preserving, Promoting and Celebrating the Palestine Poster Genre
|publisher=Palestinian American Research Center (PARC)|date=2012-06-30|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time that the Palestine Poster Project Archives was formally presented in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], although Walsh has made several media appearances and delivered lectures to promote the PPPA at various locations in the [[United States]].

'''Persian calligraphy''' ({{lang-fa|خوشنویسی فارسی}}) or '''Iranian calligraphy''' ({{lang-fa|خوشنویسی ایرانی}}) is the [[calligraphy]] of the [[Persian script|Persian language]]. It is one of the most revered arts throughout [[history of Iran]].

==History==
[[File:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Example showing Nastaʿlīq's proportion rules.{{ref label|Smith1989|1|a}}]]
{{further information|Nastaʿlīq}}

===History of Nasta'liq===
After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|introduction of Islam]] in the 7th century, Persians adapted the Arabic alphabet to [[Persian language|Persian]] and developed the contemporary Persian alphabet. The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters. An additional four letters were added by Iranians [http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], which resulted in the 32 letters currently present in the Persian alphabet.

Around one thousand years ago, [[Ibn Muqlah]] ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|ابنِ مقله بيضاوی شيرازی}}}}) and his brother created six genres of Iranian calligraphy, namely "Mohaqiq", "Reyhan", "Sols", "Naskh", "Toqi" and "[[Reqa]]". These genres were common for four centuries in Persia. In the 7th century (Hijri calendar), Hassan Farsi Kateb combined the "Naskh" and "Reqah" styles and invented a new genre of Persian calligraphy named "[[Ta'liq (script)|Ta'liq]]". In the 14th century, Mir Ali Tabrizi combined two major scripts of his time, i.e. Naskh and Taliq, and created a new Persian calligraphic style called "Nas’taliq"[http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. In the past 500 years [[Nastaʿlīq]] (also anglicized as '''Nastaleeq'''; {{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|نستعلیق}}}} ''{{transl|fa|nastaʿlīq}}'') has been the predominant style for writing the [[Perso-Arabic script]].

In the 17th century Morteza Gholi Khan Shamlou and Mohammad Shafi Heravi created a new genre called cursive Nastaʿlīq [[Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq]] ([[Persian language|Persian]]: '''&lt;span lang="fa" dir="rtl"&gt;شکسته&lt;/span&gt;''' &lt;span lang="fa" dir="rtl"&gt;'''نستعلیق'''&lt;/span&gt;). Almost a century later, Abdol-Majid Taleqani, who was a prominent artist at the time, brought this genre to its highest level. This calligraphic style is based on the same rules as Nas’taliq. However, cursive Nas’taliq has a few significant differences: it provides more flexible movements, and it is slightly more stretched and curved. Yadollah Kaboli is one of the most prominent contemporary calligraphers within this style.

==Contemporary Persian calligraphy==
In 1950, the ''[[Society of Iranian Calligraphists|Iran's Association of Calligraphers]]'' was founded by Hossein Mirkhani, Ali Akbar Kaveh, Ebrahim Bouzari, Hassan Mirkhani and Mehdi Baiani. For an overview of Persian calligraphy's development within Afghanistan, see "Calligraphy during last two centuries in Afghanistan" (1964), by Azizuddin Vakili.

===Modernist movement===
[[:fa:حسين زنده‌رودي|Zendeh Roudi]], [[Jalil Rasouli]], [[Parviz Tanavoli]], and [[Nima Behnoud]] use Persian calligraphy and Rumi poetry in dress designing.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Post modernism===
[[abol atighetchi, abolghassem]] uses combination of colored naskh, suluth and kufic style calligraphy with large letters in a single large format acrylic painting for his work presentation and circles in gold leaf or simple color to decorate but in the nastaligh style lots of colorful geometrical forms and lines are used to modernize the painting and also the same technique is used to modernize the large format birds of bessmel (مرغ بسمل), all drawn with large letters.this style of work can be classified as post modern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9299">The '''''Prebiarum de multorum exemplaribus''''' is a [[Hiberno-Latin]] interrogatory [[florilegium]] of the mid-8th century, written as a [[Dialogue#Literary and philosophical genre|dialogue]] in a series of 93 short questions and answers. The word ''prebiarum'' seems to be a corruption of ''breviarium'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Kelly, "Scripture and Tradition in the Early Irish Church," ''Scripture, tradition and reason: a study in the criteria of Christian doctrine: essays in honour of Richard P.C. Hanson'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1988), p. 163 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0Bj5pWPJgoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.] ''Multorum'' is also given incorrectly as ''multorium''.&lt;/ref&gt; though the work is not a [[breviary]] in the usual sense; the title is not customarily translated into English, but would mean something like "A Breviary of Examples from Many Sources." The [[medieval Latin|Latin]] dialogue makes use of [[Triads of Ireland|triads]], a tripartite form of expression characteristic of [[early Irish literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter is [[exegesis|exegetical]] or [[Didactic literature|didactic]]; that is, it seeks to explain or teach, often through an enumeration of its points.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Prebiarum'' is mostly of [[comparative literature|comparative]] interest, and has been dismissed as an example of texts, often written by [[Christian monasticism|monks]], that "display a vulgarization of religious subjects, treating them as popular [[trivia]], meant more for fun and humour than for any overly didactic, serious purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Liam Ethan Felsen, "Medieval Monks: Funnier Than You Thought," in ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2008), p. 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljrw9swM1fAC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization may represent an elitist view not evident to all readers of the ''Prebiarum''. Like other [[catechism|catechetical]] Hiberno-Latin writings, the ''Prebiarum'' with its modest aims seems intended to help ordinary people with [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. McNally, ''Scriptores Hiberniae Minores Pars I'', Corpus Christianorum 108B (Turnhout, 1973), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text's 20th-century editor regarded the ''Prebiarum'' as "a [[handbook]] useful to the [[itinerant preacher]], the teacher, or even to the [[spiritual father]] charged with the obligation of giving spiritual conferences or instructions. … In no sense is the work sophisticated; it is rather simple, direct, even somewhat archaic in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources, analogues, and intellectual context==
Despite its 8th-century date, the ''Prebiarum'' is disconnected from the intellectual and [[theology|theological]] preoccupations of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and represents a more "primitive state of biblical learning." Its methods cannot be said to derive from the [[exegesis|exegetical literature]] of 7th-century Ireland, nor from the [[Northumbria#Culture|Northumbrian tradition]] of [[Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a collection of miscellaneous snippets from various sources (''[[collectanea]]''), the ''Prebiarum'' draws on [[Church Fathers|patristic]] sources such as [[Jerome]], [[Augustine]], and [[Gregory the Great|Gregory]], as well as medieval writings of obscure origin. The ''Prebiarum'' is similar to the ''[[Joca monarchorum]]'' ("Monks' jests") and ''Collectanaea pseudo-Bedae'' (sometimes noted as ''[[List of works by Bede|Collectanaea Bedae]]''). The author or compiler of the ''Prebiarum'' drew on at least three works by [[Isidore of Seville]], the ''[[Etymologiae]]'', ''De ecclesiasticis officiis'', and the ''Sententiae'', along with the Irish [[pseudepigraph]]ical ''Liber de numeris''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 155; Claudia di Sciacca, ''Finding the Right Words: Isidore's'' Synonyma ''in Anglo-Saxon England'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parallels can be found in works of Irish provenance or character, such as Pseudo-Cyprian's ''[[Duodecim abusivis saeculi|De XII Abusiuis Saeculi]]'', the Irish [[Pseudo-Bede]]'s ''De XIII Diuisionibus Temporum'', the [[Cambrai Homily]], and [[Pseudo-Isidore]]'s ''Questiones tam de nouo quam de uetere testamentum''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, the text is influenced by [[Merovingian]] and [[Vulgar Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prebiarum'' is addressed to an Adalfeus (''Adalfeo spiritali''), who might tenuously be identified as the Adelphus (d. 670) who was the third [[abbot]] of [[Remiremont Abbey|Remiremont]]. The ''Adalfeo'' of the text might also be a mistaken [[Romanization of Greek|transliteration of Greek]] Ἀδελφῷ (from ''adelphos'', "brother"), and the phrase mean "for a spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triads==
[[File:Saint Virgiliusm, Salzburg (detail).jpg|thumb|100px|The '''''Prebiarum''''' most likely originated within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]] in Salzburg]]

The ''Prebiarum'' provides an enumerative response to many of the questions it poses, often in the form of a triadic utterance, including triads on greed (''cupiditas'')&lt;ref&gt;Richard Newhauser, ''The Early History of Greed: The Sin Of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 112 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OJiMn6CZ60EC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cambrai Homily#The colors of martyrdom|martyrdom]]. One pair of triads is of a type circulated in other florilegia of moral extracts:&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''Liber exhortationis'' of [[Paulinus I of Aquileia|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; for further examples of the "Three Utterances," see Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=%22Quod+sunt+quae+pessima+sunt+in+hoc+mundo%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kE8cYOOKBv&amp;sig=5U_SI94q8EH-y5TWUyqEU1UDqc0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZzD4StfTC5GKNNfBmekF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quod%20sunt%20quae%20pessima%20sunt%20in%20hoc%20mundo%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What are the worst things in this world? There are three. The soul of a sinner after death, the demons coming into his path, and not getting well rid of them for eternity.

What are the best things in this world? There are three. The soul of a just man after its departure from the body, and angels coming into his path, and to possess the eternal kingdom without end.&lt;ref&gt;''Quod sunt quae pessima sunt in hoc mundo? Id, III. Anima peccatoris post mortem, et demones venientes in obviam ei, et bene non deficiens ab eis in perpetuum.''
&lt;br&gt;''Quod sunt meliora sunt in hoc mundo? Id, tres. Anima iusti post exitum de corpore, et angeli venientes in obviam ei, et regnum perpetuum possidere sine fine.'' ''Prebiarum'' 32–33 (McNally, ''SHM'' p. 164).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The text==
The ''Prebiarum'' exists in a single [[manuscript]] that was most likely transcribed in the [[scriptorium]] of Bishop [[Arbeo of Freising]]. It thus originated in southeast Germany around [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], probably within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]], which had a strong Irish presence. It is bound with five other minor works, four of which are of Irish provenance. [[Orthography]] and linguistic aspects date the work to the mid-8th century.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''HSM'' pp. 155, 158, 159. Claudia di Sciacca concurs that the ''Prebiarum'' likely originated in the Salzburg area at the time of the bishop Virgilius, despite its Irish character; p. 43; Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 60–61, note 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this setting, it may be Arbeo who is addressed in the dedication as a "spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sankarabharanam''' ({{lang-en|The Jewel of Shankara}}) is a 1980 Indian [[Telugu language|Telugu-language]] [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Kaasinathuni Viswanath|K. Viswanath]]. Produced by Edida Nageswara Rao under the production company Poornodaya Art Creations, ''Sankarabharanam'' starred J. V. Somayajulu, Manju Bhargavi, Chandramohan and Rajyalakshmi. The soundtrack was composed by [[K. V. Mahadevan]] and remained a chartbuster. The film throws light on the chasm between Classical and Western Music based on the perspective of people from two different generations. The film was screened at the 8th [[International Film Festival of India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm8IIFAAward.aspx?PdfName=8IIFA.pdf |title=Directorate of Film Festival |publisher=Iffi.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tashkent]] Film Festival, [[Asia Pacific Film Festival]] and the [[Moscow International Film Festival]] held in May 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://dff.nic.in/2011/IP1981.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with an introduction by Viswanath in the form of a [[Sanskrit]] [[Subhashita]] शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गानरसं फणिः (Music is enjoyed equally well by babies, animals and even snakes). We hope you appreciate our effort in bringing you the 'Jeeva Dhara' (Lifestream) of Indian classical music."

"Sankarabharanam" Sankara Sastri is a very popular [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] singer and a widower. People come in huge numbers to listen to his voice and consider him a great man. He has mastered the raga ''[[Shankarabharanam]]'' and hence is eponymous with the same. Tulasi, ([[Manju Bhargavi]]) is a Dasi's daughter who has great interest in music and dance.  She is also an admirer of Sastri, and goes to the riverbank in the early mornings when Sastri typically taught his own daughter.

One morning Tulasi is so thrilled by Sastri's singing that she begins dancing on the riverbank, oblivious of her surroundings.  Sastri sees her, and Tulasi also comes to her senses&amp;nbsp;— and abruptly stops, expecting Sastri's rebuke.  But Sastri reciprocates her sincerity and continues singing&amp;nbsp;— Thus is born an unspoken, platonic teacher-student relationship between the young dancer and the veteran singer.  This bond, bound to be misunderstood by a callous world, forms the crux of the story.

Tulasi's mother, of course, wants her to follow in the family profession by servicing rich clients.  The mother is waiting for the opportune time to introduce her daughter to prostitution, and one day she extracts a high price from a rich hedonist who's eager to be Tulasi's "first".  That man forces himself on Tulasi.  The foul deed done, the man sees a photo of Sastri in Tulasi's room and flings it to the ground while telling her that she's free to become the old Sastri's girlfriend now since he's done with her.  Tulasi, quiet until then, is ostensibly more hurt by the insult to Sastri, her [[guru]], than the crime perpetrated on herself.  She takes a shard of glass from the broken frame of Sastri's photo, and stabs the client.

A murder trial ensues, and Sastri tries to save Tulasi by consulting his lawyer brother ([[Allu Ramalingaiah]]), who wins the case in Tulasi's favour.  Justice comes through as Tulasi's mother is sent to jail for unlawful flesh trade, while Tulasi is a free but homeless woman.  Sastri brings Tulasi to his home&amp;nbsp;— precipitating changes in his own life.  The public, of course, assume that Sastri is keeping Tulasi at home as a mistress&amp;nbsp;— and avoid him as a debauchee.  Even Sastri's maid and musical accompanists, who until then grudgingly bore the maestro's mentoring of "that prostitute's daughter", openly rebel and leave.  Tulasi feels responsible for Sastri's troubles, and eventually moves out of his house.

Sastri's problems are not all due to Tulasi, however.  The winds of change have made classical music wane in popularity, while [[pop music]] is on the ascendant.  Sastri loses his loyal audience and, with it, his comfortable lifestyle.  Ten years pass, and Sastri is living in a small house with his grown up daughter.  Meanwhile, by a quirk of fate, Tulasi has inherited her mother's property that was under litigation until then.  She wants to help the struggling Sastri anonymously. Tulasi has a ten-year-old son by then, ostensibly from her one-&amp;-only conjugal encounter, and wishes that her son redeems his life by becoming Sastri's student&amp;nbsp;— A chance she desperately wanted for herself, but was denied by Fate. So Tulasi gets her son to pretend to be homeless, and enter Sastri's household as a servant boy&amp;nbsp;— and to earn his trust. Things go according to plan, and Tulasi is content to watch from a distance as her son gradually becomes a part of Sastri's household, and then his musical protege.

Pamulaparti Venkata Kameswara Rao ([[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandramohan]]), a [[Amateur|dilettante]] [[Niyogi|Niyogi Brahmin]] boy, falls in love with Sastri's daughter.  Although Sastri rejects the alliance at first, he later agrees after learning of the man's interest in classical music.  Tulasi then arranges for a concert on the day of Sastri's daughter's wedding, where Sastri finds his lost audience return to hear his voice.  Sastri sings at the concert, but suffers a heart attack part-way through it.  Then his disciple, Tulasi's son, takes over from the sidelines and continues singing the song.. As Sastri watches his student with pride, he also sees Tulasi at the side of the hall, and realizes (via eye contact with his lawyer brother) that the boy is Tulasi's son. A doctor is brought to attend to Sastri, who is on stage clutching his chest with pain, but Sastri waves off the physician, knowing that his end is near. As Tulasi's son completes the song, Sastri symbolically anoints the boy as heir to his music, then dies&amp;nbsp;— Tulasi comes running to her guru at that moment, and falls down at his feet&amp;nbsp;— Moments later we realize that she too has died with the shock of Sastri's death. The film ends in this tragic but uplifting note, as the newly-weds Chandra Mohan &amp; Sastri's daughter take charge of Tulasi's son.

==Production==
After hearing the plot, the producers were initially taken aback due to the [[parallel cinema]] tone to the subject matter, but finally [[Edida Nageswara Rao]] agreed to produce the film. He wanted [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] to enact the role of Sankara Sastry, [[K. Viswanath]] wanted [[Sivaji Ganesan]] to perform the role, but couldn't approach him for various reasons and also wanted [[Krishnam Raju]] for the role, but later refused as Viswanath felt his image as a star would ruin the role and he finally chosen a debutant [[J. V. Somayajulu]], a stage artist for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/Original-choice-Sankarabharanam|title=Original choice for Sankarabharanam?|first=|last=admin|date=8 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vamsy]], who went on to direct films like ''[[Sitaara]]'', ''[[Anveshana]]'' and ''[[Ladies Tailor (1985 film)|Ladies Tailor]]'' was one of the assistant directors in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/lessons-in-direction/article7642344.ece|title=Lessons in direction|first=B.

==Soundtrack==
The music, largely [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] based, was composed by [[K.V. Mahadevan]].
[[M. Balamuralikrishna]] was the original choice for the male playback singer, due to the heavy classical content of the compositions. But K. V. Mahadevan, having faith in the mettle of [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]], insisted on him taking up this challenge.

==Release and reception==
Released on 2 February 1980, the film was released in only a very few theatres and opened to almost empty halls.&lt;ref name="Telugu Cinema Etc&amp;nbsp;— Idlebrain.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/interview_gudipoodi.html|title=Telugu Cinema Etc - Idlebrain.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to positive word-of-mouth, the film opened to packed houses and had a 216-day run at Royal theatre, [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinegoer.com/alltimelongrun.htm|title=CineGoer.com - Box-Office Records And Collections - All Time Long Run List|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515123606/http://www.cinegoer.com/alltimelongrun.htm|archivedate=15 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The success of this film triggered a sequence of classical films in Telugu, including ''[[Saptapadi (1981 film)|Saptapadi]]'', ''[[Tyagayya (1981 film)|Tyagayya]]'' (by [[Bapu (artist)|Bapu]]), ''[[Meghasandesam]]'' (by Dasari N. Rao), and Viswanath's own follow-ups: ''[[Saagara Sangamam]]'', ''[[Shrutilayalu|Sruthi Layalu]]'', ''[[Swarna Kamalam]]'',''[[Swayam Krushi]]'', ''[[Sirivennela]]'', and ''[[Swati Kiranam]]''.&lt;ref name="idlebrain.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/nosta/sankarabharanam.html|title=Telugu Cinema Nostalgia - Sankara Bharanam - JV Somayajulu, Manju Bhargavi and K Vishwanath|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[S.P. Balasubrahmanyam]]'', the Telugu playback singer who rendered all the songs of Sastri's character, has often said this movie was the highlight of his career. It got 'SPB' his first National Award, and made him a household name across all of South India. Film critic Gudipoodi Srihari called it as the best Telugu film he has seen after ''[[Mayabazar]]''.&lt;ref name="Telugu Cinema Etc&amp;nbsp;— Idlebrain.com"/&gt; Viswanath later remade the film in Hindi as ''[[Sur Sangam]]'' with [[Girish Karnad]], and [[Jaya Prada]] in the lead roles.&lt;ref name="Telugu Cinema Etc&amp;nbsp;— Idlebrain.com"/&gt;

'''The Society of Painters in Tempera''' was founded in 1901 by [[Christiana Herringham]] (1852–1929) and  a group of British painters who were interested in reviving the art of [[tempera]] painting.  Lady Herringham was an expert copyist of the Italian [[Old Masters]] and had translated ''Il Libro dell' Arte o Trattato della Pittura'', [[Cennino Cennini]]'s fifteenth-century handbook on [[fresco]] and tempera.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lago.

In 1904, members of the Society were: [[Edwin Abbey|Edwin Austin Abbey]], [[Robert Bateman (artist)|Robert Bateman]], [[John Dickson Batten]], his wife Mary Batten, [[Robert Anning Bell]], [[Lota Bowen]], John Cooke, [[Walter Crane]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Mary Sargant Florence]] and  [[Roger Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;Volume 1 ''Papers of The Society of Painters in Tempera'' {{cite web |url=http://www.eggtempera.com/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921045107/http://www.eggtempera.com/history.html |archivedate=21 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable  members included [[Bernard Sleigh]], [[Joseph Southall]] and [[Estella Canziani]].

The Society, which was also referred to as the Society of Mural Decorators and Painters in Tempera, published a number of papers on the subject of tempera painting which have been edited in three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;

Vol.I edited by Mary Sargant Florence (1924),

Vol.II edited by John Dickson Batten (1935),

Vol III edited by Mary Sargant Florence (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

After going into decline, the Society was revived in 1997 as the Society of Tempera Painters and is now established in the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Society of Tempera Painters {{cite web |url=http://www.eggtempera.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125073640/http://www.eggtempera.com/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stone spheres''' (or '''stone balls''') '''of Costa Rica''' are an assortment of over three hundred [[petrosphere]]s in [[Costa Rica]], located on the Diquís Delta and on [[Isla del Caño]]. Locally, they are known as '''Las Bolas''' (literally '''The Balls'''). The spheres are commonly attributed to the extinct [[Diquis]] culture and are sometimes referred to as the '''Diquís Spheres'''.  They are the best-known stone sculptures of the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] area.  They are thought to have been placed in lines along the approach to the houses of chiefs, but their exact significance remains uncertain.

The '''Palmar Sur Archeological Excavations''' are a series of excavations of a site located in the southern portion of [[Costa Rica]], known as the Diquís Delta. The excavations have centered on a site known as "Farm 6",  dating back to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 [[Common era|CE]]) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE).

In June 2014, the Precolumbian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquis was added to the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1160|title=Six new sites inscribed on World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 June 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spheres range in size from a few centimetres to over {{convert|2|m|ft}} in diameter, and weigh up to 15 tons.&lt;ref name="bbc2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=The stone spheres of Costa Rica |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593717.stm |date=29 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are sculpted from [[gabbro]],&lt;ref name="bbc2010"/&gt; the coarse-grained equivalent of [[basalt]]. There are a dozen or so made from shell-rich [[limestone]], and another dozen made from a [[sandstone]].  They appear to have been made by hammering natural boulders with other rocks, then polishing with sand.  The degree of finishing and precision of working varies considerably. The gabbro came from sites in the hills, several kilometres away from where the finished spheres are found, though some unfinished spheres remain in the hills. They are used for decoration.

==Geographic setting and location==
The archaeological site of Palmar Sur is located in the southern portion of Costa Rica, known as the Diquís Delta, and in the southernmost part of the Puntarenas Province. The Diquís Delta is defined as the alluvial plain with the geographical boundaries of the Fila Grisera to the north and east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Osa Mountains comprising the southern boundary.

The Site is located in [[Palmar Sur]], southern [[Costa Rica]]. The site is located on approximately 10 hectares of property that was previously owned by the [[United Fruit Company]] in the alluvial plain of the Térraba River.

==Site description==
[[File:Farm 6 archaeological site, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Farm 6 Archaeological site]]
The archaeological site of Farm 6 has been dated to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 CE) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE). It was a multifunctional site accommodating a settlement and a cemetery, and remains of monumental architecture and sculpture are also present on the site. The monumental architecture consists of two mounds which were constructed with retaining walls made of rounded river cobbles and filled with earth.  The site contains multiple locations where large stone spheres are found ''in situ''. Additionally, since many of the stone spheres in the region were removed from their original locations and serve as landscape decoration, the site has become a storage location for spheres that have been returned to the National Museum. Also, there is a neighboring town to Farm 6 that also had spheres or "esferas." They were called "zanahoriagas," for their more oval-like shape.

==Pre-Columbian history==
[[File:Pre-Columbian Stone Balls at Palmar Sur, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palmar Sur airport park]]
The stones are believed to have been first created around the year 600, with most dating to after 1000 but before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]]. The only method available for dating the carved stones is [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]], but most stones are no longer in their original locations. The culture of the people who made them disappeared after the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/uok-uok032210.php|title=University of Kansas researcher investigates mysterious stone spheres in Costa Rica|author=Brendan M. Lynch|date=22 Mar 2010|accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-contact history==
The spheres were discovered in the 1930s as the United Fruit Company was clearing the jungle for [[banana plantation]]s.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; Workmen pushed them aside with bulldozers and heavy equipment, damaging some spheres. Additionally, inspired by [[El Dorado|stories of hidden gold]], workmen began to drill holes into the spheres and blow them open with sticks of [[dynamite]]. Several of the spheres were destroyed before authorities intervened. Some of the dynamited spheres have been reassembled and are currently on display at the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica|National Museum of Costa Rica]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

The first scientific investigation of the spheres was undertaken shortly after their discovery by Doris Stone, a daughter of a United Fruit executive. These were published in 1943 in ''[[American Antiquity]]'', attracting the attention of [[Samuel Kirkland Lothrop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Biographical memoirs, Volume 48| chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=43U3AD_F9UMC&amp;pg=PA253| page=253|chapter=Samuel Kirkland Lothrup| author=National Academy of Sciences| publisher=[[National Academies Press]] | year=1877| accessdate=2010-03-31| authorlink= United States National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Tim McGuinness| url=http://www.mysteryspheres.com/history.htm| title=Costa Rican Diquis Spheres: Sphere history| publisher=mysteryspheres.com| accessdate=2010-03-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329102018/http://www.mysteryspheres.com/history.htm| archivedate=2010-03-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he and his wife attempted to excavate an unrelated archaeological site in the northern region of Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Prehistoric Stone Balls—a Mystery| url= http://naturalhistorymag.com/print/1353| author=Eleanor Lothrop| publisher=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] | work=Picks from the Past | date=September 1955| accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had just disbanded its professional army, and the resulting civil unrest threatened the security of Lothrop's team.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In San José he met Doris Stone, who directed the group toward the Diquís Delta region in the southwest ("Valle de Diquís" refers to the valley of the lower [[Térraba River|Río Grande de Térraba]], including the [[Osa Canton]] towns of [[Ciudad Cortés|Puerto Cortés]], [[Palmar Norte]], and [[Sierpe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/costaricagaz.shtml#Diquis Gazetteer of Costa Rican Plant-Collecting Locales: Diquís (or Dikís)] from the website of the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and provided them with valuable dig sites and personal contacts. Lothrop's findings were published in ''Archaeology of the Diquís Delta, Costa Rica 1963''.

In 2010, University of Kansas researcher John Hoopes visited the site of the Stone Spheres to evaluate their eligibility for protection as a [[Unesco]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593717.stm |title=The stone spheres of Costa Rica |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:UFCO remnants.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Remnants of UFCO occupation in Palmar Sur]]

Before the arrival of the Companía Bananera de Costa Rica, a branch of the United Fruit Company, and banana plantations in the 1930s, vegetation in this area offered a great deal of biodiversity in both plant and animal resources. Resources available to Precolumbian inhabitants in this alluvial plain consisted of riverine and ocean resources, including mangrove forests located in the Terraba and Sierpe Rivers.

[[File:Palmar Sur, Costa Rica (2007).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modern Landscape of Palmar Sur, Costa Rica]]

The rich alluvial soils of this region facilitated historical agriculture since the 1930s. The United Fruit Company dominated this southern region with banana plantations as early as the 1920s in Parrita and Quepos. The UFCO entered Palmar Sur in the 1930s under the name of Companía Bananera de Costa Rica in an effort to avoid antimonopoly legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Villalobos 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the landscape is still carved into agricultural fields which are owned by co-ops and consist of plantain, banana, and palm plantations.

==Early researchers in the region==
Scientific research in the alluvial plain, particularly on United Fruit Company properties, began in the 1940s with the work of [[Doris Zemurray Stone]] and Samuel Lothrop. Lothrop's work focused on excavation at a handful of sites, one being Farm 4. His work aimed to document all archaeological sites containing "in situ" stone spheres, to record the number of spheres and their dimensions, and to make detailed maps illustrating both their arrangement and alignments.

After the work of Lothrop and Stone, research in the area took a hiatus for nearly fifty years.  In the 1990s, [[Claude Baudez]] and a team of researchers set out to establish a ceramic chronology of the region by observing the change in ceramic styles over time.&lt;ref&gt;Baudez, ''et al.'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished by examining the drainage ditches that were cut into the landscape by the UFCO. Research carried out by [[Ifigenia Quintanilla]], under the direction of the MNCR from 1991–1996 was performed in the region under the project titled "Man and Environment in Sierpe-Terraba" focusing on settlement patterns, occupational sequences, and resources utilized in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Quintanilla 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Corrales and Adrian Badilla, archaeologists with the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, have performed continuous research in the region since 2002.  Their research began in 2002 and focused on four archaeological sites in the region containing stone spheres and of which comprise a "circuit". These sites include Grijalba, Batambal, El Silencio, and "Farm 6". The purpose of the project was to assess the cultural significance of the sites, to protect the cultural heritage, in addition to beginning research and studies at the sites.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Corrales and Badilla produced a booklet entitled ''El Paisaje Cultural del Delta del Diquís'' which provides a quick overview on the history of the Diquís Delta, the history of banana plantations and the UFCO, the natural environment, archaeological sites in the region, and the importance of the Diquís region as an [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has continued in the region by Corrales and Badilla focusing on the archaeology and the Precolumbian political structure in the Diquís Delta. Research emphasis was on chiefdoms and their associated archaeological indicators. Their objectives were to study the archaeological sites containing stone spheres in the Diquís Subregion to gain an understanding of community configuration, activity areas, sequences of occupation, and the recording of monumental architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2005, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Research is currently ongoing at the "Farm 6" site under the direction of archaeologists at the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica. The first field season in which archaeological excavations were undertaken was in 2005. Objectives during this field season included defining the area in which two mounds were located, sphere alignments, and various excavations associated with mound 2. In 2007, as second field season was undertaken focusing on archaeological excavations of Mound 1. During this field season, a stone sphere was discovered "in situ"  in association with the mound.

==Tourism==
Archaeo-tourism is a concept that is still relatively new in Costa Rica.  To date, the national monument of [[Guayabo]] de Turrialba is primarily the only archaeological site open for tourism.  Tourism on a smaller scale is occurring at the site of Farm 6 but is open to visitors upon paying a nominal fee to tour the museum display and then tour the grounds, viewing some of the discovery sites.  It is no longer necessary to have an appointment.  Future plans of the MNCR are to open the site to tourism on a larger scale and to include other sites nearby in the region.

==Myths==
Numerous myths surround the stones, such as they came from [[Atlantis]], or that they were made as such by nature. Some local legends state that the native inhabitants had access to a potion able to soften the rock. [[Limestone]], for example, can be dissolved by acidic solutions obtained from plants. Research led by [[Joseph Davidovits]] of the [[Geopolymer Institute]] in France has been offered in support of this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geopolymer.org/dl/?x=pdf&amp;get=CemPlant.pdf|title=Making Cements with Plant Extracts|author=Joseph Davidovits|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the spheres were created from [[gabbro]], an acid-resistant igneous rock.&lt;ref name="SkeptoidEpisode"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4452|number=452|date=3 February 2015|title=The Stone Spheres of Costa Rica|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cosmogony of the Bribri, which is shared by the Cabecares and other American ancestral groups, the stone spheres are “Tara’s cannon balls”. Tara or Tlatchque, the god of thunder, used a giant blowpipe to shoot the balls at the Serkes, gods of winds and hurricanes, in order to drive them out of these lands.

It has been claimed that the spheres are perfect, or very near perfect in roundness, although some spheres are known to vary over {{convert|5|cm}} in diameter.  Also, the stones have been damaged and eroded over the years, and so it is impossible to know exactly their original shape.  A review of the way that the stones were measured by Lothrop reveals that claims of precision are due to misinterpretations of the methods used in their measurement.  Although Lothrop published tables of ball diameters with figures to three decimal places, these figures were actually averages of measurements taken with tapes that were nowhere near that precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~hoopes/balls/errors.htm |title=Errors and Misinformation |author=John W.

'''''The Death of General Wolfe''''' is a well-known 1770 painting by Anglo-American artist [[Benjamin West]] depicting the death of British General [[James Wolfe]] at the 1759 [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle of Quebec]] during the [[French and Indian War]] (which was the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]). It is an [[oil on canvas]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period. West made an additional and nearly identical painting of the same scene for [[George III of the United Kingdom]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Montagna, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

The Death of General Wolfe depicts the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle of Quebec]], also known as the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], on September 13, 1759. This was a pivotal event in the [[Seven Years' War]] and decided the fate of [[New France|France's colonies in North America]].

The [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|battle]] was fought between the British Army and the French Army; the pitched fighting lasted only fifteen minutes.  The British Army was commanded by [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]. Although successful in holding the British line against the French and winning the battle, General Wolfe was killed by several bullet wounds.

In death, General Wolfe gained fame as a [[Britishness|national hero]].  He became an icon of the [[Seven Years' War]] and of British dominance in late eighteenth century [[British North America|North America]].&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"&gt;http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa128.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
West depicts General Wolfe as a [[Christ]]-like figure. This painting has a triangular [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], made by the top of the flag (as the apex) and the positions of the men. It resembles Christian "[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]" scenes, where Christ is held in the embrace of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="smart"&gt;Zygmont, Bryan. "Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe."{{cite web|last=Zygmon|first=Bryan|title=Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/benjamin-wests-the-death-of-general-wolfe.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Hervey Smythe]] is pictured holding Wolfe's right arm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/851783 National Trust Collection – Death of General Wolfe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of the [[First Nations|Indigenous]] warrior in the painting—kneeling with his chin on his fist, looking at General Wolfe—has been analyzed in various ways. In art, the touching of one's face with one's hand is a sign of deep thought and intelligence (thus [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]''). Some consider it an idealization inspired by the [[noble savage]] concept (Fryd, 75). Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying the warrior in the painting can be found in the [[British Museum]]'s collection (as well as additional First Nation artefacts used in other paintings by West).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=37698&amp;peoA=37698-3-17 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ground in front of Wolfe are his [[musket]], [[cartridge box]], and [[bayonet]]. Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. His dress is also of note. He is wearing a red coat, a red waistcoat, red breeches, and a white shirt. Such dress was rather simple, especially for a commanding officer.

Next to Wolfe, in the blue jacket, is Dr [[Thomas Hinde]], who is attempting to stem the bleeding from Wolfe's wounds. The general later died in the doctor's hands.

In the background, and to the left of the men surrounding Wolfe, an approaching runner is depicted. He is waving his hat in one hand to attract their attention, and with the other hand carries a captured flag with the [[Fleur-de-lis]] (a symbol of France)—symbolic of the news relayed to the dying Wolfe that the French were being defeated.

The inclusion of [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], Lieutenant Colonel of the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]] (behind the man in green uniform, identified in the painting as Sir William Johnson) is interesting, as General Wolfe had always spoken highly of Fraser's regiment, yet Fraser was not at the battle, as he was recovering from wounds received earlier.  In the painting, Fraser wears the Fraser tartan, which was probably worn by officers in that regiment. All in all only four of the fourteen men depicted were actually at the battleground.

The clothing West depicted in this scene was highly controversial at the time. Although the event was relatively recent—only eleven years prior—its subject matter made it a fitting example of the genre of [[history painting]], for which contemporary dress was unsuitable. During the painting, several influential people, including Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], instructed him to dress the figures in classical attire, and after its completion, [[George III]] refused to purchase it because the contemporary clothing compromised the dignity of the event. The work, however, eventually overcame all objections and helped inaugurate more historically accurate practice in history painting.&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;
[[File:DeathofWolfe.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[William Woollett]]'s engraving was the best-known copy of West's original and became popular around the world &lt;ref&gt;[http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html New Brunswick Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055946/http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |date=2009-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The painting was originally exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in [[London|London, England]]. It was presented to [[Allies of World War I|Canada]] in 1921 as a tribute for its service in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=5363|title=The National Gallery of Canada: The Death of General Wolfe, 1770|date=2015|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Woollett|William Woollett's]] engraving was the best-known copy of West's original painting and became popular around the world. A black-and-white copy of the engraving can be seen at [[Brodick Castle]] on the [[Isle of Arran]], Scotland.

== Variants ==

Besides the original, at least four other additional versions of the Death of General Wolfe were also produced by [[Benjamin West|West]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.19thcenturyart-facos.com/artwork/death-general-wolfe&lt;/ref&gt; The primary copy of ''The Death of General Wolfe'' is currently in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], with further examples at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (Canadiana art collection), as well as the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]]. The fourth copy produced resides at [[Ickworth House]], Suffolk, England. Each reproduction had its own variation in the depiction of Wolfe's death.&lt;ref name="gallery.ca"&gt;http://www.gallery.ca/bulletin/num7/stacey1.html&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth autograph copy was commissioned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1771 and is still in the [[Royal Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/407297/the-death-of-wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic interpretation ==

West's depiction of Wolfe's death in the midst of battle is figurative rather than literal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russborough.com/antique_prints/military/seven_years_war/death_of_wolfe.html#deathofwolfe&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting, though widely celebrated, has also been heavily criticized in its historically inaccurate portrayal of Wolfe's death itself. For example, the stature of the observing [[First Nations|Native American]] figure and the prominent figures surrounding Wolfe as he lay dying are a great example of [[Aesthetic interpretation|artistic interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.19thcenturyart-facos.com/artwork/death-general-wolfe|title=Death of General Wolfe|author=Michelle Facos|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that any figures surrounding Wolfe in the painting were actually present at his death. All the figures in the painting were senior military figures and would have been busy elsewhere in battle because Wolfe died at the height of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle]] itself and not after.&lt;ref name="gallery.ca"/&gt;

However, West's choice to show General Wolfe's death in the figurative manner of a dying martyr, many compare to [[Jesus|Christ]], transforms Wolfe's death from a simple casualty of war to one of a hero that symbolized the [[British Empire|British]] cause.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/monarchy-enlightenment/english-portraiture/britain-ageof-revolution/a/benjamin-wests-the-death-of-general-wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite the fact that the painting is a more dramatized version of Wolfe's death than reality, West's work was groundbreaking for art of its time.&lt;ref name="gallery.ca"/&gt;

Previously, [[Neoclassicism|contemporary scenes]] were painted in a Greek and Roman setting. Others advised West against using realistic eighteenth-century visuals such as modern costumes. Although Wolfe's death had already been painted by at least two other artists prior to West and those paintings also strove to portray Wolfe and his death in a more realistic style, the success of West's painting helped to further establish a new style of art that others had already begun to pioneer.&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"/&gt;

Wolfe's death and the portrayal of that event by Benjamin West make up half of [[Simon Schama]]'s historical work ''Dead Certainties: Unwarranted Speculations'' (1991).

'''''The Old Guitarist''''' is an oil painting by [[Pablo Picasso]] created late 1903{{snds}}early 1904. It depicts an old, blind, haggard man with threadbare clothing weakly hunched over his guitar, playing in the streets of [[Barcelona, Spain]]. It is currently on display at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] as part of the [[Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection]].&lt;ref name="artic"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/28067 Art Institute of Chicago, ''The Old Guitarist'', About this work]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of ''The Old Guitarist''’s creation, [[Modern art|Modernism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] had merged and created an overall movement called [[Expressionism]] which greatly influenced Picasso’s style. Furthermore, [[El Greco]], Picasso’s poor standard of living, and the suicide of a dear friend influenced Picasso’s style at the time which came to be known as his [[Blue Period]].&lt;ref name="artic" /&gt; Several x-rays, infrared images and examinations by curators revealed three different figures hidden behind the old guitarist.

==Blue Period==

At the time, having renounced his classical and traditional education and searching for fame, Picasso and his friend [[Carlos Casagemas]] moved to Paris. A year later, Casagemas became hopelessly miserable from a failed love affair and committed suicide. Picasso was greatly afflicted by this  event and was soon depressed and desolate. In addition, Picasso was very poor. His poverty made him identify and relate to beggars, prostitutes and other downtrodden outcasts in society.&lt;ref name="artic" /&gt;

These events and circumstances were the impetus for the beginning of Picasso’s [[Blue Period]] which lasted from 1901 to 1904. The Blue Period is identified by the flat expanses of blues, greys and blacks, melancholy figures lost in contemplation, and a deep and significant tragedy. After the Blue Period came [[Picasso's Rose Period]], and eventually the [[Cubism]] movement which Picasso co-founded.&lt;ref name="artic" /&gt;

==Analysis==

Elements in ''The Old Guitarist'' were carefully chosen to generate a reaction from the spectator. For example, the [[monochromatic]] color scheme creates flat, two-dimensional forms that dissociate the guitarist from time and place. In addition, the overall muted blue palette creates a general tone of melancholy and accentuates the tragic and sorrowful theme. The sole use of oil on panel causes a darker and more theatrical mood. Oil tends to blend the colors together without diminishing brightness, creating an even more cohesive dramatic composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.123HelpMe.com/view.asp?id=46491 Essay on ''The Old Guitarist'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the guitarist, although muscular, shows little sign of life and appears to be close to death, implying little comfort in the world and accentuating the misery of his situation. Details are eliminated and scale is manipulated to create elongated and elegant proportions while intensifying the silent contemplation of the guitarist and a sense of spirituality. The large, brown guitar is the only significant shift in color found in the painting;&lt;ref name="artic" /&gt; its dull brown, prominent against the blue background, becomes the center and focus. The guitar comes to represent the guitarist’s world and only hope for survival. This blind and poor subject depends on his guitar and the small income he can earn from his music for survival. Some art historians believe this painting expresses the solitary life of an artist and the natural struggles that come with the career. Therefore, music, or art, becomes a burden and an alienating force that isolates artists from the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/writingart8/archives/2004/12/the_blue_period.html Blue Period Music: ''The Old Guitarist'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030643/http://blogs.princeton.edu/writingart8/archives/2004/12/the_blue_period.html |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And yet, despite the isolation, the guitarist (artist) depends on the rest of society for survival. All of these emotions reflect Picasso’s predicament at the time and his criticism of the state of society. ''The Old Guitarist'' becomes an allegory of human existence.&lt;ref name="artic" /&gt;

[[Paul Mariani]], a biographer of [[Wallace Stevens]], presented his analysis of the painting as a counterpoint to objections raised by Stevens concerning the origin of his own poem titled ''[[The Man With the Blue Guitar]]'' stating, "Despite his repeatedly denying it, Stevens does seem to have a particular painting in mind here: Picasso's 1903 ''The Old Guitarist'', which portrays an old man with white hair and beard sitting distorted and cross-legged as he plays his guitar. If Picasso attempted to portray the world of poverty and abject misery, it was because that had been his own plight as a struggling young artist in Barcelona, where he painted many pictures including this one, of the poor. The painting is almost entirely done in monochromatic blues and blue-blacks, except for the guitar itself, which is painted in a slightly warmer brown. The man is blind but, no longer seeing the world around him, he sees more deeply into the reality within."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mariani. Biography of Wallace Stevens. Page 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Old Guitarist'', Picasso may have drawn upon [[George Frederic Watts]]'s painting of ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'' (1886), which similarly depicts a hunched, helpless musician with a distorted angular form and predominantly blue tone.&lt;ref name="tate.org"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2004 |url = http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/where-theres-life-theres|title = Where there's life there's|publisher = [[Tate]]| accessdate = 12 March 2010 | last=Barlow| first= Paul |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrared discoveries==

[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|Detail showing an image beneath]]

Recent x-rays and examinations by curators found three figures peering behind the old guitarist’s body. The three figures are an old woman with her head bent forward, a young mother with a small child kneeling by her side, and an animal on the right side of the canvas. Despite unclear imagery in crucial areas of the canvas, experts determined that at least two different paintings are found beneath ''The Old Guitarist''.&lt;ref name="X-Ray"&gt;[http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/art/art-OldGuitaristLady.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/art.htm&amp;usg=__dVLakrOuVjE-datGwb5ZVeae1bA=&amp;h=365&amp;w=391&amp;sz=80&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=dUwC8IDLqFleLM:&amp;tbnh=143&amp;tbnw=154&amp;ei=RpN5Td_uH4aisQPI3cGKAw&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DThe%2Bold%2Bguitarist%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1290%26bih%3D784%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=243&amp;vpy=279&amp;dur=2536&amp;hovh=217&amp;hovw=232&amp;tx=203&amp;ty=124&amp;oei=RpN5Td_uH4aisQPI3cGKAw&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=37&amp;ved=1t:429,r:11,s:0 X-Ray Image of ''The Old Guitarist'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, researchers used an [[infrared]] camera to penetrate the uppermost layer of paint (the composition of ''The Old Guitarist'') and clearly saw the second-most composition. By using this camera, researchers were able to discover a young mother seated in the center of the composition, reaching out with her left arm to her kneeling child at her right, and a calf or sheep on the mother’s left side. Clearly defined, the young woman has long, flowing dark hair and a thoughtful expression.&lt;ref name="Infrared"&gt;[http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.artic.edu/aic/conservation/revealingpicasso/images/xray_200pxl.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.artic.edu/aic/conservation/revealingpicasso/exam_xray.html&amp;usg=__mzLq_wqI538Q2SMkL8GjIF4gWPE=&amp;h=299&amp;w=200&amp;sz=23&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=bHttlAJiL4gtBM:&amp;tbnh=137&amp;tbnw=97&amp;ei=iJN5TfHIHY-isAPlqOWKAw&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DThe%2Bold%2Bguitarist%2Binfrared%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1290%26bih%3D784%26tbs%3Disch:10%2C131&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=465&amp;oei=iJN5TfHIHY-isAPlqOWKAw&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=26&amp;ved=1t:429,r:24,s:0&amp;tx=79&amp;ty=40&amp;biw=1290&amp;bih=784 Infrared Image of ''The Old Guitarist'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Institute of Chicago shared its infrared images with the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., where curator William Robinson identified a sketch by Picasso sent to his friend Max Jacob in a letter. It revealed the same composition of mother and child, but it had a cow licking the head of a small calf. In a letter to Jacob, Picasso reveals he was painting this composition a few months before he began ''The Old Guitarist''. Despite these discoveries, the reason Picasso did not complete the composition with a mother and child, and how the older woman fitted into the history of the canvas, remain unknown.&lt;ref name="X-Ray" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Infrared" /&gt;

The '''visual workplace''' is a continuous improvement paradigm that is closely related to [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), and [[operational excellence]] yet offers its own comprehensive methodology for significant financial and cultural improvement gains. Introduced by [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] in her 1997 book ''Visual Systems,''.,&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (1997) ''Visual Systems: Harnessing the Power of a Visual Workplace'' AMACOM {{ISBN|978-0814403204}}&lt;/ref&gt; this system integrates and codifies the many iterations of visuality in the world of continuous improvement.

==Brief History of Visual Information Sharing==

Visual communication rests on the natural inclination of humans to use pictures, graphics, and other images to quickly and simply convey meaning and understand information. For instance, look at the practices and applications that civil engineers have developed to handle complex human interaction on our roads and highways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''] Retrieved on 22 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the entire field of [[wayfinding]] in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp_rpt_052.pdf ''Wayfinding &amp; Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminals''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same logic eventually migrated into the workplace, notably in post-war Japan, and most saliently at Toyoda Motors where visual applications (visual devices) became a commonplace element in the Toyota Production System (TPS).&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H. (1995) ''5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace,'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-1563270475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading companies in Japan, such as Canon and Okidata, adopted many of the same practices. However, while visibility was clearly a part of Japan's success solution, it was only noticed—or cited in the literature—as a generalized principle and not a codified system or a framework of thinking. For example, Dr. Robert W. Hall, in his 1983 book, ''Zero Inventories,'' states: "Establishing visibility of all forms of production problems is very important. ...The entire idea is instant communication."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Robert W. (1983). ''Zero Inventories,'' Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin {{ISBN|978-0870944611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Japan's JIT (just-in-time) manufacturing approach had an easy-to-understand visual interface: andon (stacked lights) kanban (pick-up tickets for control material quantity), color-coding (to make the match between items), scheduling boards for daily production, easy-to-read labels on shelving, and lines on the floor to trace out locations.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H.(1988) ''JIT Factory,'' {{ISBN|978-0870944611}} Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese master practitioners also noted that visual devices made it easy to see the difference between normal and abnormal: "…abnormal conditions and problems need to be obvious enough to catch people's attention. Because of the emphasis on visual methods for quick information transfer, the practice is called ’management by sight’ or ‘visual control’." &lt;ref name=Suzaki&gt;Suzaki, Kiyoshi (1987) ''The New Manufacturing Challenge'' The Free Press {{ISBN|978-1451697551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzaki also compared the responsiveness of a well-tuned production system with the way the human body responds to stimuli and problems: "…Corrective action is taken right away, just as our muscles pull our hand away when we touch a hot plate."&lt;ref name=Suzaki/&gt;

Michel Greif's book, ''The Visual Factory'' &lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel (1997) ''The Visual Factory'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299676}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferred the name for the first time, though Dr. Greif's theme focused primarily on the ability of visual applications to increase the interest of hourly workers in their own performance and their participation in company improvement activities.

==A Codified System of Visual Functions==
Throughout this period (1983–1991), [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] was head of training and development at Productivity Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a publishing, training, and consulting firm known for bringing the work of Japan's manufacturing leaders to the United StatesGalsworth headed study missions to Japan and observed visuality in Japan first-hand. She also had the opportunity of working one-on-one with many of Japan's seminal thinkers, including [[Taiichi Ohno]], Ryuji Fukuda, and [[Shigeo Shingo]]. Dr. Shingo personally tasked Galsworth with developing his mistake proofing/poka-yoke methodology for western companies.&lt;ref&gt;Shingo, Shigeo (1986) ''Zero Quality Control'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299072}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the synthesis of all these factors and influences that lead Dr. Galsworth to develop and codify the many threads of visuality into a coherent methodology of the visual workplace.

The visual workplace, then, is an overall operational strategy and philosophy, geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals through visual devices and systems. Galsworth continues to be the main driving force behind the practice and articulation of workplace visuality, along with a network of individuals and companies loosely coupled as visual workplace practitioners around the world. The visual workplace is a large body of knowledge and know-how, with a strong guiding philosophy of continuous improvement with an emphasis on the centrality of the individual in the prosperity of the enterprise.

==Basic Principles==

While virtually all major improvement paradigms in use in the West incorporate some element of visuality, the entire codified set of visual principles and practices, from the foundation of 5S through to visual guarantees (poka-yoke), rests on this definition: "The visual workplace is a self-ordering, self-explaining, self-regulating, and self-improving work environment—where what is supposed to happen does happen, on time, every time, day or night—because of visual devices."&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2005) ''Visual Workplace, Visual Thinking,'' Visual-Lean Enterprise Press {{ISBN|978-1932516012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visual workplace is defined by devices designed to visually share information about organizational operations in order to make human and machine performance safer, more exact, more repeatable, and more reliable. The more the process becomes visual, the more production velocity increases.&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2011) ''Work that Makes Sense: Operator-Led Visuality'' Visual-Lean Press {{ISBN|978-1932516302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is accomplished in parallel with generating new levels of employee engagement and contribution, which in turn lead to improved alignment within the enterprise and significant bottom line benefits. In an effective visual workplace, this level of information can be seen and understood without coaching, supervision or the need for an explanation—at best, without speaking a word.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/jobs/the-visual-workplace-and-how-to-build-it.html?_r=0 ''Don't Just Talk About Change, Show It.''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key principle is to install vital information visually as close to the point of use as possible. When a step-by-step methodology is applied, the visual workplace targets the elimination of the seventh waste, ''motion'', defined as ''moving without working.''&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"/&gt;

Originally implemented and refined in manufacturing settings, the concept of the visual workplace is now taking hold in such wide-ranging venues as libraries&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Christian [http://creativelibrarypractice.org/2013/02/11/library-as-visual-workplace/ ''The Library as Visual Workplace''] Retrieved Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark (2012) ''Lean Hospitals'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|9781439870433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UTE logo.png|right]]
The '''Union of European Theatres''' (UTE; {{lang-fr|Union des Théâtres de l'Europe}}) is an alliance of [[Europe]]an public [[theatre]]s. It serves to promote [[European integration]] through cultural interaction.
It does intensive transnational theatre work comprising over ten thousand performances and reaching three million viewers
each season. The UTE presents festivals, exhibitions, workshops, theatre school collaborations, colloquiums and co-productions throughout Europe. The Union des Théâtres de l'Europe has over 40 members, 20 of which are major national and municipal theatres from 17 countries.

== History ==

The UTE was founded in 1990 by [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], then Culture Minister of France, and Italian theatre director [[Giorgio Strehler]]. Apart from fostering European integration, their motivation also was the perceived threat to European [[cultural diversity]] posed by [[globalisation]]:

:"Already then we felt that the building of Europe required a firm stand against the unruly vagaries of the economic machine. Today we find ourselves faced with the same questions: how do we defend art within a [[market economy]] whose logistics are designed to [[Pensée unique|standardise our way of life and thought]] so that we are reduced to a state of passive [[consumerism]]? Can public policies that support the arts be more effective?"

== Mission ==

The UTE's stated mission is
:"to contribute to the building of the [[European Union]] through [[culture]] and [[theatre]], to encourage a collective cultural movement that breaks through language barriers in order to develop an art theatre which is seen as a vector of fraternity among people. The UTE promotes productions and co-productions, theatre exchanges and shared experiences while respecting individual identities and cultures. ... Etched in continuity, the sum of these activities helps in elucidating the objectives of artistic and cultural policies that aim to reinforce artistic cooperation and transnational circulation in Europe."

The UTE is a “multinational house”, an idea which corresponds to the so-called “Mehrspartenhaus” in German Theatre – that is, one major theatre with different departments, and in the case of the UTE one theatre that consists of seventeen national theatres but yet remains a single entity. This “multinational house” intensively discusses the questions of a European identity and the role of culture in its formation. Its goal is to promote cultural activities across national borders that respect the principles of the particular identities, a thing that requires common and continuous research. Its current programme focuses on projects that put new working methods to the test and connects experienced theatre creators with enthusiastic newcomers, projects which are close to the citizens of the different European cities, and all this on a long-term scale.

== Members and structure ==

The UTE is governed by a General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute_general_assemblies&lt;/ref&gt; and a board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''What would Jesus do?'''" (often abbreviated to '''WWJD''') became popular, particularly in the United States but elsewhere as well, in the 1990s and as a personal [[motto]] for adherents of [[Christianity]] who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a [[moral imperative]] to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.&lt;ref name=BBCnews&gt;{{cite web|title=What would Jesus do?: The rise of a slogan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16068178|website=www.bbc.com/news/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmeke|first1=Karen B.|last2=Sori|first2=Catherine Ford|title=The Therapist's Notebook for Integrating Spirituality in Counseling I|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781135884710|page=150|quote=In recent years, largely among Protestant and Catholic circles, the catch phrase "What Would Jesus Do" has become popular. The phrase is an attempt to call people to consider how Jesus Christ might respond to personal situations in daily life. While the idea of thinking about Jesus Christ might respond in a given situation is not new, the popularity of the catch-phrase "What Would Jesus Do?" or WWJD, has increased. Bracelets, keychains, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other items initialized with WWJD have become commonplace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular consciousness, the acronym signifying the question—WWJD—is associated with a type of bracelet or wristband which became a popular accessory for members of Christian youth groups, both Catholic and Protestant, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do Bracelets|url=http://www.mortaljourney.com/2010/11/1990-trends/wwjd-bracelets|publisher=Mortal Journey|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Theological background===
{{see|Christian perfection|Imitatio Dei|Holiness movement}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] emphasizes the concept of ''Imitatio Christi'' ([[imitation of Christ]]), which is summarized well in the English phrase "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/02/what_would_jesu.html|title="What Would Jesus Do?": A History|last=Rothman|first=Josh|date=8 February 2011|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|language=English|accessdate=27 December 2016|quote="What would Jesus do?" has its roots, Shore explains, in the tradition of imitatio Christi - that is, of imitating the life of Christ. In this tradition, which dates back to early Christianity, a true believer might imitate Jesus by giving to the needy, traveling to the Holy Land, or, in the case of Saint Francis of Assisi, "receiving the stigmata, the bodily marks of Christ's suffering." Imitatio Christi encouraged Christians to "do as Jesus did."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]], in 1766 postulated the concept of [[Christian perfection]], a moment in the life of a Christian at which the [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] effectuated by the [[Holy Spirit]] results in a "perfection in love" which means that at least at that moment one is being motivated wholly by [[Great Commandment|love of God and neighbor]], with no taint of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] or ulterior motives in effect. While such Christian perfection is expressed in outward action, it is also the effect of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]. Indeed, Wesley could speak of [[sanctification]] by faith as an analogous doctrine to the more widely held belief in [[justification by faith]]. Because Christian perfection is also visible in outward [[good works]] and a rigorously moral lifestyle, adherents of the [[Holiness movement]] assumed that a perfectly moral lifestyle is a consequence (not the cause) of the [[State (theology)|state of grace]] and ultimate [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].

===Earlier appearances of the term, 1420s–1891===
[[Charles Spurgeon]], a well-known evangelical preacher in London, used the phrase "what would Jesus do" in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon no. 2210. Spurgeon.org {{cite web|last1=Spurgeon|first1=Charles|title=The Agreement of Walking by Faith|url=https://archive.spurgeon.org/sermons/2210.php|website=Spurgeon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by [[Thomas à Kempis]] between 1418 and 1427, ''Imitatio Christi'' (The Imitation of Christ).

===1896 novel===
[[Charles Sheldon]]'s 1896 book ''[[In His Steps]]''  was subtitled "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896). [http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html ''In His Steps''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107084725/http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html |date=2012-11-07 }}. First published by the ''Chicago Advance'' in serial form.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sheldon's novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] church in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon's theology was shaped by a commitment to [[Christian Socialism]]. The [[ethos]] of Sheldon's approach to the [[Christian]] life was expressed in this phrase "What Would Jesus Do", with Jesus being a moral example as well as  a Saviour figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/research/collections/documents/personalpapers/findingaids/sheldon_charles.htm Charles Monroe Sheldon/Central Congregational Church Collection, 1811-1984].&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon's ideas coalesced with those that formed into the [[Social Gospel]] espoused by [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon's novel,&lt;ref name=FloridaCara&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Burnidge |first=Cara L. |date=Spring 2009 |title=Charles M. Sheldon and the Heart of the Social Gospel Movement |type=M.A. |publisher=Florida State University |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110154107/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheldon himself identified his own [[theology]] with the Social Gospel.&lt;ref name=FloridaCara/&gt;

Due to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon's novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;

In this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 [[language]]s by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a [[homelessness|homeless]] man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of [[Jesus|Christ]]. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,

"All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
All my being's ransomed powers,
All my thoughts, and all my doings,
All my days, and all my hours."

and I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there's an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don't understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin."&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896) ''In His Steps,'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This leads to many of the novel's characters asking, "What would Jesus do?" when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its core &amp;mdash; the life of Christ.

In 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps''. Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version "is based on many actual events in the lives of believers."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett W. Sheldon with Deborah Morris, ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps'' (1993), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.

===1990s===

===2000s===
In 2005, Garry Wills wrote "What Jesus Meant", in which he examined "What Would Jesus Really Do" (also a book review in ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'').

===2010===
In April 2010 a film, ''WWJD'', starring [[Adam Gregory]] and based on ''In His Steps'' by Charles Sheldon, was released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Would Jesus Do?|url=https://www.amazon.com/What-Would-Jesus-John-Schneider/dp/B003UCA4XI|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 31 March 2015 a sequel film was released ''WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123718/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film using the moniker ''WWJD II'' was ''The Woodcarver'' which was released in 2012. It has a similar theme but different characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woodcarver (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2047890/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
The expression has become a [[snowclone]], sometimes for humorous effect. For example, ''[[What Would Jesus Buy?]]'', "What Would [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] Do?", "[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]", "What Would [[Mary Marvel]] Do?", "What Would [[Johnny Cash]] Do?", and "What would [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] do?".&lt;ref&gt;A small book investigating Tintin as a role model for young people. http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/title/2796&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and leadership==

The term "What Would Jesus Do?" or "WWJD" is also perceived as a fundamental management and leadership principle given Jesus' methodology of going to the marketplace to preach and lead by example. In modern management principles, more academic and professional references are going to the [[gemba]] or [[Management by Walking Around]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e.globis.jp/article/000240.html|title=MBA Buzz: Pope Francis and the Rebuilding of the Catholic Culture |accessdate=2013-06-11 |author=King del Rosario |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whirl-Mart''' is a [[culture jamming]] ritual aimed at retail [[superstore]]s and described by participants as "art and action".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXQMrC-U9pEC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22Whirl-Mart%22#PPA102,M1 Stewart, Kathleen. Ordinary Affects. Duke University Press, 2007]. {{ISBN|0-8223-4107-7}}. P.102&lt;/ref&gt;

An event consists of a group of supposed shoppers who congregate at a large superstore (usually a [[Wal-Mart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Asda]], or [[J Sainsbury|Sainsbury's]]) and slowly push empty shopping carts silently through store aisles. Participants will not purchase anything and seek to form a lengthy chain of non-shoppers, continually weaving and "whirling" through a maze of store aisles for up to an hour at a time. Participants describe their actions as "a collective reclamation of space that is otherwise only used for buying and selling". Whirl-Marters seek to mimic and mock what they perceive as the absurdity of the [[shopping]] process.

==Origins==
The activity was founded by the group "Breathing Planet Troupe" at a Wal-Mart store in [[Troy, New York]], USA on April 1, 2001. The group was seeking to respond to an article from [[AdBusters]] magazine that called for foolish activities in conjunction with [[April Fool's Day]]. Since that time, Whirl-Mart activities have spread to many other communities around the world, including [[Texas]], [[Iowa]], [[Arizona]], and [[Pennsylvania]] in the USA, [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It is often "celebrated" at noon on the first Saturday or Sunday of the month. Whirl-Marters are often very loosely organized, describing themselves as open to anyone wishing to show up and participate.

In addition to being "just darned fun," the activity provides a legal outlet for would-be protesters to address "cathedral(s) of consumption" like Wal-Mart. Consequently, experienced Whirl-Marters (when confronted by security or store management) do not admit to being protestors and instead maintain that they are engaged in a peaceful "consumption awareness ritual." Whirl-Marters do not aim to block store aisles or interfere with legitimate shoppers, and typically will not speak unless addressed. Their aim is to create a non-disruptive, peaceful demonstration of how ridiculous they see Western [[consumerism]] to be. Participants are non-confrontational in seeking to make themselves silent examples rather than active propagandists. Some variations of the Whirl-Mart protest involve filling carts but then simply abandoning them or, when checking out, claiming to have forgotten the money to purchase the items in the overflowing cart, leaving said cart for the employees to clean up.

==Confrontations==
Participants claim they can generally talk their way out of being evicted from the store's corporate property (though the involvement of [[police|law enforcement]] officials in forcibly removing Whirl-Marters is not unheard of). When employees approach, Whirl-Mart participants generally scatter to various store aisles, forcing management or security to confront them individually. Participants will very rarely admit to or even address the topic of non-violent protest of [[commercialism]] or [[Economic materialism|materialism]], preferring to present themselves as would-be shoppers who are "still looking for something to buy" after spending up to an hour wandering aimlessly through a warehouse-sized superstore. Whirl-Marters often wear an identifying shirt or smock; in most jurisdictions it is not legally considered soliciting to wear a garment advertising a product, service, or cause.

Some participants have attempted to document their activities with cameras or video recorders. The film or tape from these are often seized by store authorities. A few websites have video documenting Whirl-Mart events; however, in general, superstores do not permit cameras or video recorders on their premises &amp;mdash; excluding security cameras used by the [[corporation]] itself.

The '''white horse of Kent''' or the '''white horse rampant''' is a symbol of [[Kent]], a [[Counties of England|county]] in south-east [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBC7880889/&gt;

The figure of the prancing (or [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] in heraldry) white horse can also be referred to as '''Invicta''', which is the [[Invicta (motto)|motto of Kent]].&lt;ref name=BBC7880889&gt;{{cite web

|quote=A prancing white horse is the logo for the county council and has been the symbol of Kent for hundreds of years. However, a sculpture of the Invicta, supported by Kent County Council in response to Mr Wallinger's entry, was rejected by judges last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The white [[horse]] of Kent is the old symbol for the [[Jutes|Jutish]] [[Kingdom of Kent]], dating from the 6th–8th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hampshireflag.co.uk/world-flags/allflags/gb-kent.html www.hampshireflag.co.uk] Coat of Arms&lt;/ref&gt;

The white horse relates to the emblem of [[Horsa]], the brother of [[Hengest]], who according to legend defeated the King [[Vortigern]] near [[Aylesford]]. The first recorded reference to the white horse can be found in ''Restitution of Decayed Antiquities'' from 1605 by [[Richard Verstegan]] although there is possible evidence that it was used much earlier (see the reference below to the origin of 'Invicta'). The book shows an engraving of Hengist and Horsa landing in Kent in 449 under the banner of a rampant white horse. Indeed, continental origins of this emblem can be found from the coat of arms of [[Lower Saxony]], the Dutch region of [[Twente]], the [[House of Welf]] (who adapted it in the late 14th century; before then the Welf coat of arms was a golden lion on red ground) and the modern German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: the [[Saxon Steed]]. Some historians note that [[Jutes]] migrating to Kent through the continent may have been associated with the [[Rhineland]] south of the Saxons.
The county motto 'Invicta' ("Unconquered") often seen on a scroll underneath the horse dates back to the 1060s when the county was granted the right to retain its ancient symbol of the white horse and granted the motto by [[William the Conqueror]]. The story associated with this is that sometime after the Norman invasion William was ambushed in the forest that then existed outside [[Strood]] astride the London Road (the modern A2). William's escort were overpowered and he found himself at the mercy of a group of outlawed Jutish nobles. In exchange for his freedom they were pardoned and as the men of Kent had overpowered the conqueror the county was given the right to use its emblem and the new motto 'Invicta', 'Unconquered'.

File:Flag_of_Twente.svg|Flag of the region of [[Twente]], in The Netherlands
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Usage==
The horse is a key part of the official [[coat of arms]] of the county, and appears on the coat of arms of many of the boroughs of Kent, and London boroughs [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of Kent, like in the [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Bexley]] and the [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Bromley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/kent.html www.civicheraldry.co.uk] Kent Borough Council coats of arms&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[University of Kent#Coat of arms|University of Kent coat of arms]]. The horse is depicted on the [[flag of Kent]] and forms part of the modern logos of [[Kent County Council]], the [[Kent Fire and Rescue Service]] and the [[Kent Police]]. The horse is also depicted on the badges of [[Gillingham F.C.]], [[Welling United F.C.]] and [[Bromley F.C.]]

The horse also features on the logos of many companies and sports teams in Kent. It was used on the former ''[[Invictaway]]'' London commuter coaches operated by [[Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalbusco.fotopic.net/p12901490.html Image of a black liveried Invictaway bus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://flickr.com/photos/andytakersdad/1472885872/in/set-72157601795326096/ Image of a green liveried Invictaway bus]&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of [[pubs]] in the county also feature ''White Horse'' in their name, although this also occurs around the [[United Kingdom]] and may not necessarily relate to the Kent horse.

{{italic title}}
'''''Womanhouse''''' (January 30 – February 28, 1972) was a [[feminist art]] installation and performance space organized by [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]], co-founders of the California Institute of the Arts ([[CalArts]]) [[Feminist Art Program]]. Chicago, Schapiro, their students and women artists from the local community, including [[Faith Wilding]], participated.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23"&gt;Revisiting Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago and Schapiro encouraged their students to use consciousness-raising techniques to generate the content of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;

Only women were allowed to view the exhibition on its first day, after which the exhibition was open to all viewers. During the exhibition's duration, it received approximately 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Site to Vision: The Woman's Building in Contemporary Culture|year=2011|publisher=OTIS School of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles|author=Meyer, Laura|editor=Sondra Hale and Terry Wolverton|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins==

The Feminist Art Program began at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971 after an experimental year at Fresno State College under the name Women's Art Program. The students in the program were admitted as a group when Chicago and Schapiro were hired at Cal Arts after Chicago found that the [[Fresno State College]] Art department was reluctant to embrace her vision of a new kind of female centered art. It was their intention to teach without the use of authoritarian rules or a unilateral flow of power from teacher to student.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"&gt;The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminist Art Program, was slated to occupy a new building, but found itself without adequate space at the start of the school year in 1971. The lack of appropriate studio space paved the way for a collaborative group project set to highlight the ideological and symbolic conflation of women and houses. The end result of this project was the ''Womanhouse'' installation, built by the students in an abandoned Victorian house just off of the CalArts campus.

The program utilized a method of teaching that relied on group cooperation. Students would sit in a circle, and share their thoughts on a selected topic of discussion. The circular teaching method was intended to provide a "nourishing environment for growth" and to promote a "circular, more womb-like" atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"/&gt; The goal of these discussions was for each woman to reach a higher level of self-perception, to validate their experiences, as well as the "search for subject matter" to incorporate into artwork and to address their individual aesthetic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schapiro |first=Miriam |date=Spring 1972 |title=The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse |jstor=775513  |journal=Art Journal |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=268–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many students fostered resentments towards Chicago and Schapiro, claiming they were suffering from their own power trips. Chicago insisted her students feelings were the result of their own internalized sexism and unconscious manifestations of their difficulties dealing with female authority figures.&lt;ref&gt;Balducci, Temma. "Revisiting “Womanhouse”: Welcome to the (deconstructed) “Dollhouse”." ''[[Woman's Art Journal]]'' 27, no 2. (2006): 17-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The project's goals, as professed by Schapiro and Chicago, were to help students overcome some problems of being a woman. These included "a general lack of assertiveness or ambition", an "unwillingness to push themselves beyond their limits”, “lack of familiarity with tools and artmaking processes”, and an “inability to see themselves as working people". It was thought that by teaching the women to use power tools and proper building techniques, they would gain confidence and subsequently "restructure their personalities" to be consistent with their artistic goals. It was Schapiro and Chicago's belief that "society fails women by not demanding excellence from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|accessdate=2014-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques were to result in an "exclusively female environment" that included a greater community of female artists. The goal of this community was to expose the students to "established" female artists not limited to Schapiro and Chicago.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay"&gt;Womanhouse Catalog Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Harper]], an art historian for the California Institute of Arts Feminist Art Program, is credited for suggesting the idea for ''Womanhouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelan|first=Peggy|title=Live Art in LA: Performance in Southern California, 1970-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaoZSpldJZ8C&amp;pg=PA38|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415684224|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schapiro supervised ''Womanhouse'''s dramatic works, while Chicago focused on other media.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt; Their intention was to transform a domestic environment into one that fully expressed the experiences of women.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

"Womanhouse began in an old deserted mansion on a residential street in Hollywood and became an environment in which: “The age-old female activity of homemaking was taken to fantasy proportions. Womanhouse became the repository of the daydreams women have as they wash, bake, cook, sew, clean and iron their lives away." Before creating the art environments and pieces, the students had to do extensive reconstruction on the house which had been empty for many years. They have to fix broken windows and furnitures.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. Womanhouse catalog essay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction/Process ==

The group broke into teams in order to find a suitable location for their "dreams and fantasies".&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27"&gt;Recalling Womanhouse&lt;/ref&gt;
They found a 17-room,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=Paula |date=Summer 1985 |title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s |jstor=3174313  |journal=Signs |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=762–781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 75-year-old dilapidated mansion at 533 N. Mariposa Ave. in a rundown section of Hollywood. Members of the group knocked on doors to find the owner of the house, who one neighbor remarked would "certainly not be interested in the project".

After a visit to the Hall of Records, they found the owner to be Amanda Psalter. The group described their intentions for the house in a letter to the Psalter Family. In response, the house was granted through a special lease agreement&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"&gt;First Feminist Art Program&lt;/ref&gt;  for the 3-month duration of the project. After this time, it would be demolished.&lt;ref name="Schapiro 1987 p27" /&gt; Construction spanned from November 1971 to January 1972.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

In order to renovate the house, the women tackled tasks included cleaning, painting, sanding scraping and wallpapering walls, replacing windows, sanding floors, and installing lights. New walls were built for practical and aesthetic reasons and women learned wallpapering techniques to refurbish one of the rooms. Eventually a crew was needed to paint the exterior of the house, install locks and advise the women on basic electrical wiring.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268"/&gt;

The women struggled as they began renovating the mansion during the winter, as the building did not have hot water, heat, or plumbing.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"&gt;Wilding, Faith. (1977). By Our Own Hands. Double X. 06 October 2014. &lt;http://womanhouse.refugia.net&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations included replacing 25 windows and replacing banisters that had been pulled out by vandals. They worked 8 hour days&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt; in a “manner they were unaccustomed to”, soon coming to resent the intense, “impossible” demands, even coming to see their administrators as “monsters” and complaining that they would fail.“&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay" /&gt; To cope with the frustration of learning new techniques while meeting stringent deadlines, the group held meetings to deal with any problems that arouse and sessions to raise group consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"/&gt; Some former students now see this tension as a result of Chicago's authoritarian presence, feeling that she imposed her own goals on the group.&lt;ref name="Harper pg. 772"/&gt;

Here are some perspectives from participators when they recall the struggles of ''Womanhouse'' after 25 years later.&lt;ref name="Re:Tracing the Feminist Art Program"&gt;&lt;http://www.encore.at/retracing/index2.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Camille Grey : “Put 30 women together and see what happens. A nightmare.”

Robin Mitchell: " It was simultaneously one of the best and worst experiences of my life.”

Mira Schor: " I left the Program after one year, because of my disagreements, and because I wanted to experience the school outside the confines of the Program. I have avoid group feminism since then.

Nancy Youdelman:" Looking back 25 years later, I have mixed feeling about the Feminist Art Program – We had something really incredible and unique and somehow we could not get beyond personalities and create a lasting support system

In the journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', Paula Harper says, "the young students did not have much personal experience of traditional marriage and homemaking roles of women. Nonetheless, the ideas of all were influenced by the general aim of feminists in the late 1960s to revise women's position in society by bringing attention to their oppression, and this ideology clearly shared by the many individuals involved gave Womanhouse its impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harper, Paula. “The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s.” Signs 10, no.4 (1985): 772.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working collaboratively on ''Womanhouse'', the students gained new skills while developing a deeper understanding of human and personal experiences. The students also provided tours of the exhibition, which gave them the opportunity to articulate their artwork while maintaining their personal vision when faced with criticism.  Even though the exhibition provided the students with great satisfaction and team effort some of the artists didn’t feel any personal accomplishment, and were looking forward to going back to work on their individual projects.&lt;ref name="Wilding, Faith 1977"/&gt;

The mansion contained a variety feminist installations, sculptures, performances and other forms of art. The artists creating ''Womanhouse'' did so, centralizing a white, cisgender, heterosexual and middle-class experience of womanhood in the early seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Balducci, Temma. 2006. "Revisiting ‘Womanhouse’: Welcome to the (deconstructed) “Dollhouse”." ''Woman's Art Journal'' 27, no. 2: 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt; By transforming a "woman's space" (such as a kitchen) into a radical feminist art truly made a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Performance Anthology|year=1989|publisher=Last Gasp Press|location=San Francisco CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they spoke out about women issues, as well as criticizing the patriarchy. This helped women artists and architects gain recognition and acknowledgement that their work could be seen on the same level as men. Using a mansion as their chosen setting furthered their statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rooms/installations ==

'''Nurturant Kitchen''' - ''by Susan Frazier, Vicki Hodgetts, Robin Weltsch''.
Present in the kitchen are plates of food under a line of light bulbs, resembling it to a factory worker's assembly line. This highlights the dehumanizing aspects of a woman's role as nurturer.
* '''Aprons in Kitchen''' - ''by Susan Frazier'' A display in Nurturant Kitchen. Aprons are fashioned with breasts and other female body parts. This allows the female to remove her bodily features when she is done with housework, implying that her physical body is inextricably linked to her societal role. 
* '''Eggs to Breasts''' - Forms cover the ceilings and walls, starting as eggs on the ceiling and gradually transforming into breasts as the pattern continues down. Underscores the woman's traditional role as a nurturer by combining images of the kitchen and of a woman's sagging breasts.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
'''Dining Room''' - ''by Beth Bachenheimer, Sherry Brody, Karen LeCocq, Robin Mitchell, [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Faith Wilding]].''
The ''Dining Room'' features a crown molding of lifelike painted fruit. A mural, based on a 19th-century still life by [[Anna Peale]], is displayed on a wall behind the dining room table. The table itself features a bread dough sculpture, turkey, ham, pecan pie, vinyl salad bowl, vinyl wine glasses and a wine bottle. A chandelier hangs above the table. Below the table, a stenciled-rug is painted directly onto the floor.
''Dining Room'' is the most collaborative project in ''Womanhouse'', utilizing the efforts of seven women to complete. It is meant to express a generous, bountiful and romantic aura.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "&gt;Womanhouse.refugia.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bridal Staircase''' - ''by Kathy Huberland.''
Features a life-size doll replica of a bride, complete with veil and wedding dress, descending the stairs. She is fixed against the wall on the landing. Gauzy fabric adorns the walls and garlands of green and flowers encircle the bannister.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Personal Environment''' - ''by Judy Huddleston''. Intended by the artist to be "an entirely different world" that transcends the "established plane".&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="womanhouse.refugia.net"/&gt;

'''Crocheted Environment''' - ''by Faith Wilding''. Resembling a "primitive womb shelter", the room is painted black. Crocheted thread covers the wall, and a single light bulb illuminates from the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; 

'''Leaf Room''' - ''by Ann Mills''. A room with painted leaves. The leaves represent cycles; of seasons, life and feelings. They also functioned as symbolic “shields” for the artist, allowing her to both expose herself and hide at the same time.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Leah's Room''' - ''by Karen LeCocq, Nancy Youdelman.''
Lea, a character based on the aging courtesan from [[Colette]]'s novel ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'', sits in a watermelon pink bedroom. The performance (performed by LeCocq) occurred continuously on a daily basis, and involved Lea applying makeup meticulously, then removing it, in an endless cycle to illustrate the pain of aging and the deperate process of trying to restone ones beauty.
The performance illustrates the high standards of beauty levied by the pressure of society for women to maintain at all cost. Lea makes continual efforts to keep the attention of a man as her beauty deteriorates with age.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Personal Space''' - ''by Janice Lester.'' A bedroom that serves as the artist's personal fantasy, a room that only she can enter. The secret room acts as both a sanctuary and a trap.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Painted Room''' - ''by Robin Mitchell." An otherwise white bedroom with painterly splashes of color on the walls and floor.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Red Moon Room''' - ''by Mira Schor.'' A painting features a self portrait of the artist and a rising red moon over rolling hills.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Shoe Closet''' - ''by Beth Bachenheimer.''
Hundreds of pairs of shoes were collected, painted and treated for this installation. A 'spike heel' features real spikes driven from the bottom of the shoe.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; A closet with a comically extravagant number of shoes conveys the desperate attempt of women to be fashionable.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Linen Closet''' - ''by Sandy Orgel.''
A female mannequin is installed in the closet, with shelves and drawers bisecting her body parts. Folded towels sit on the shelves.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Lipstick Bathroom''' - ''by Camille Grey.''
A bathroom where every fixture is painted bright, 'Lipstick' red.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt; The room features 200 plastic lipsticks, a fur-lined bathtub, and a female figure painted entirely red. Stage lights were used to light the bathroom.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Menstruation Bathroom''' - ''by [[Judy Chicago]].'' The bathroom is painted a stark white, and a layer of gauze covers the shelves. A single trashcan is overflowing with what appear to be used tampons, a woman's "hidden secret" that cannot be covered up.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Nightmare Bathroom''' - ''by Robbin Schiff.'' A bathtub hosts a woman's figure with most of her body obscured in water, made entirely from loose sand.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''The Dollhouse Room''' - ''by Sherry Brody, [[Miriam Schapiro]].'' According to Schapiro, ''The Dollhouse Room'' juxtaposes themes of "supposed safety and comfort in the home" with "terrors existing within its walls".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "&gt;Womanhouse.refugia.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Dollhouse''' - ''The Dollhouse'' serves as the centerpiece of ''The Dollhouse Room''. It is a six-room miniature house. The artist's studio room contains a miniature nude man atop a pedestal, with an erect penis and bananas at his feet. Downstairs, a miniature woman sits at her dressing table. There are many monsters present in the dollhouse, despite its familiar domestic aspects. To the left of the artist's studio is a nursery with a baby replaced by a monster. Outside the window, peering in, is a grizzly bear. Downstairs, a group of ten men stare in through the kitchen window. A rattlesnake is curled on the parlor floor.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt; ''The Dollhouse'' was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1995 and is the only publicly available piece of ''Womanhouse''.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;
* '''Lingerie Pillows -''' Created by Sherry Brody, the pillows were sewn from underwear and bras and displayed on a small tabletop. Miriam Schapiro related a story that the curator of LACMA came to have a tour of ''Womanhouse.'' In the Dollhouse Room, he picked up one of the pillows and when he realized that he was holding, he was embarrassed.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268" /&gt; Schapiro recalled that everyone in the room had laughed, but upon reflection she wished that she had questioned his aversion to something delicate, intimate, and feminine.&lt;ref name="Schapiro pg. 268" /&gt;

'''The Nursery''' - ''by Shawnee Wollenman.'' Oversized furniture and toys simulate the feeling of being young, a small person in a big room. Special attention was made to make the space an androgynous, ideal living space for a child.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Garden Jungle''' - ''by Paula Longendyke.'' What resembles the skeletal forms of dead animals is present in the garden area. This is meant to convey the weakness and vulnerability of such animals.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Necco Wafers''' - ''by Christine Rush.'' Pastel colors contrast the otherwise organic colors of the garden. The ground is painted, and "fanciful clouds" create a "fantasy sky".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

== Performances ==
Workshops led by Judy Chicago were held in the Living Room of the house. Ideas for pieces were derived from "informal working sessions", in which the women acted out aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Three Women''' - Three 'types' of women are represented; the hustler, the hippie, and the mother. They wear exaggerated makeup are initially meant to be comical. They tell the stories, all 'trapped' in some aspect of being a woman.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''Maintenance''' Pieces:  
'''Scrubbing''', ''Performed by Christine Rush'' and '''Ironing''', ''Performed by Sandra Orgel'' - 
Two performance pieces pertaining to maintenance. 
A woman scrubs the floor on all fours with a brush in a continuous, repetitive motion. Another woman irons identical sheets over and over. 
This isolated monotonous tasks for an audience to highlight their performative nature, and how these performances play a role in the construction of gender roles.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Cock and Cunt play''' - ''Written by [[Judy Chicago]], performed by Janice Lester and [[Faith Wilding]].'' Two characters wearing costumes featuring comically large genitalia converse as "She" and "He", each acting out the roles of their designated sex. "He" argues that her lack of a penis justifies having to do the dishes. This is meant to show how exaggerated essentialist notions about the female body contribute to her role in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] and to reveal the consequences of stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Balducci pg. 17-23" /&gt;

'''Waiting''' - ''Written by Faith Wilding.'' The actress sits in a rocking chair and slowly recounts how her days were structured around 'waiting' for things to happen; her husband to give her pleasure, her kids to leave home, and waiting for some time for herself.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

'''The Birth Trilogy''' - In the first section, a group of women stands in a line as they symbolically 'give birth' to one another. The 'babies' in this scenario lay on the ground until their 'mothers' come to hold and nurture them. In the end, all of the women gather in a circle as they chant and sing with heads bowed. The chant grows louder with time, ending in a "peak of ecstatic sound".&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Website "/&gt;

== Reception ==
''Womanhouse'' was the first feminist art project to receive attention on a national scale following its review by [[Time (magazine)]].
''Womanhouse'' exhibition served as an introduction of feminism to the general public a revolutionary act for the early 1970s, and it sparked lots of debates. One year after ''Womanhouse'' closed, in an article published by ''Ms.'' Magazine: "Many women artists have organized, are shedding their shackles, proudly untying the apron strings--and, in some cases, keeping the apron on, flaunting it, turning it into art."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, "Household Images in Art," Ms. 1 (no. 9, March 1973), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cradle of Feminist Art"&gt;&lt; http://www.as-ap.org/content/womanhouse-cradle-feminist-art-sandra-sider-0&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1972 review in the ''Los Angeles Times'' by William Wilson described ''Womanhouse'' as a "lair of female creativity" that "reminds us that the female is our only direct link with the forces of nature".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lair of Female Creativity|last=Wilson|first=William|date=February 21, 1972|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he remarks that "man's greatest creative acts may be but envious shadowings of her fecundity"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, this review may have also highlighted stereotypical patriarchal attitudes surrounding connections between women's bodies, the domestic, and nature that ''Womanhouse'' attempted to critique. Paula Harper argued that such language is an attempt by critics to soften the impact of ''Womanhouse'' by assimilating it according to conventions of femininity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some individuals strongly opposed this exhibition. Some critics claimed that radical feminist art projects such as ''Womanhouse'' "undermined aesthetic standards" in the 1970s. Others claimed that it was more therapy than art. Paula Harper challenged this critique, arguing that challenging the definition of art is a "function of the avant-garde”.

Lack of scholarly attention paid to ''Womanhouse'' is attributed to its very early production in the context of Feminist art, its lack of controversiality in relation to other installations of the time (most notably Chicago's own ''[[The Dinner Party]]''), and some accusations of essentialism. However, it is also argued that the piece illustrates, complicates and subverts a "false binary" of essential and constructed identity which enhances its value and relevancy.

=== Influence ===
Artists, artworks, and institutions have been inspired by ''Womanhouse''. The ''Womanhouse'' exhibition cannot be rebuilt, but a few of the rooms have been recreated for special exhibitions. In 1995, for example, the Bronx Museum of the Arts exhibited The Dollhouse by Sherry Brodyand Miriam Schapiro, along with Faith Wilding's Womb Room, a recreation of Judy Chicago's Menstruation Bathroom, and Beth Bachenheimer's Shoe Closet, among others.  ”&lt;ref name="Cradle of Feminist Art" /&gt;

The feminist spirit of ''Womanhouse'' lives on through the website Womenhouse, which was inspired by the groundbreaking 1972 exhibition. [[Faith Wilding]] is among the participants in this collaborative site featuring virtual rooms and domestic spaces. Womenhouse catapults the issues raised by the original exhibition into the twenty-first century, within "a cyber-politics that addresses the multivalent vicissitudes of identity formation and domesticity.”

==Films==
''Womanhouse'' was produced by Johanna Demetrakas. Miriam Schapiro arranged for a 47-minute documentary film to be made about the project and released in the summer of 1972. The project was produced by Johanna Demetrakas under the auspices of the American Film Society and is a part of Women Make Movies and was released in 1974.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Demetrakas was said to be "impressed" and "inspired" by the project.&lt;ref name="Womanhouse Catalog Essay" /&gt;

''Womanhouse is Not a Home'' was a film produced by Lynne Littman and directed by Parke Perine. It aired during February 1972 on the local KCET PBS channel.&lt;ref name="womanhouse.refugia.net" /&gt; The film showed the installations, had the women artists speak about their work, and featured a consciousness raising session with [[Gloria Steinem]].  

''Woman's House'' was an experimental film by [[Mako Idemitsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/181799?artist_id=26369&amp;locale=en&amp;sov_referrer=artist|title=Mako Idemitsu|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Modern Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is a thirteen-minute film that provides close up details of various installations.
