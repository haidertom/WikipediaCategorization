The '''Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry''', in abbreviated form '''ASCAME''', is an organisation of international scope, of a voluntary, non-profit making nature. It unites the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other similar institutions of the countries of the [[Mediterranean basin]], and works on the assumption that the [[Black Sea]] is a natural extension of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascame.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=110459&amp;name=DLFE-804.pdf ASCAME Statute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328075847/http://www.ascame.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=110459&amp;name=DLFE-804.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCAME was formed on 1 October 1982. The Constitutive General Assembly was held in Barcelona, hosted by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation. It is an Organization with a potential membership of 500 Chambers of Commerce, and other associated entities, from the 23 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

Today, ASCAME is the most important representative of the Mediterranean private sector with over 250 Chambers of Commerce from the 23 countries of the Mediterranean basin. ASCAME is a well-consolidated entity that represents the interest of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and the Private Sector, also being accredited as an economic partner of the EU and international organizations in carrying out economic cooperation projects.
ASCAME represents all North and South chambers and business regardless of their size and sector of activity.

==History==

The Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry – ASCAME – was founded on October 1, 1982, as an initiative of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with its counterparts from different Mediterranean countries, and in 1994 it was transformed in an International Association, on the initiative of the Chamber of Commerce of Marseille. 
From the about ten founding member of 1982, today ASCAME brings together over two hundred Chambers of Commerce and similar institutions, from twenty-two Mediterranean countries: [[Albania]], [[Algeria]],  [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.ca.camcom.gov.it/f/Sardegnaeconomica/n./n.32001b.pdf What is ASCAME] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328075845/http://images.ca.camcom.gov.it/f/Sardegnaeconomica/n./n.32001b.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCAME was created with the primary goal of furthering economic cooperation throughout the Mediterranean region, showing a strategic vision of North-South cooperation and integration. This vision was confirmed by the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in 1995 and is validated today by the Union for the Mediterranean.

==Objectives==

According to article 3 of the Statutes, “''The fundamental purpose of this Association is to establish permanent contacts andforge lasting relationships among its members in order to co-ordinate, implement andpromote studies and joint actions with a view to developing economic exchanges andco-operation within the Mediterranean area of international scope.''”

The objectives that the association wants to achieve are:

• The creation of a network of Chambers of Commerce and organisations working in the field of cooperation and economic exchange between countries in the Mediterranean region.

• Promotion of and search for synergies between these countries' economies.

• The creation of working ties between peer institutions aimed at encouraging international cooperation through joint performance of activities and/or studies.

• Assertion of the Mediterranean identity.

• Contribution to create an area of peace, tolerance, security and prosperity.

==Members==

As a result of amendments approved by the Extraordinary General Assembly of Tunis of May 2001, the Association envisages two types of membership: ''Full Members'', all the Chambers of Commerce of the Mediterranean countries, and ''Associate Members'', which are the various Mediterranean institutions and organizations having a relationship with the objectives of ASCAME.

Baboom described the service as a "Music marketplace that combines Fair Trade Streaming with a music store".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=https://baboom.com/about |website=Baboom |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930192528/https://baboom.com/about |archivedate=30 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service however was quickly put on hold "until further notice", as stated on Baboom's website, even before it could celebrate its first year.

== Model ==
Baboom's website states that fans (users) can play the music they want on any device, own the music forever, support artist and be part of the "inner circle", Upload their own music, which include Lossless format.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

It also states the service gives artists 90% of the revenue, fair trade streaming, premium following, a right management system and a career analytics system.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Russel Brown of the ''Public Address'' blog said in a review that:
{{quote|the most interesting thing about Baboom is the way it addresses some of the problems with the streaming market we've discussed here in recent weeks. Its "fair trade streaming" model works in a fundamentally different way to Spotify et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/baboom-its-serious/ | title=Baboom: it's serious | work=Public Address | accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Apps == 
The service supports both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The apps at the time has limited functionality, with only allowing to listen to music, as well as to download, but at the time of writing have no search function.

'''PT Bank Central Asia Tbk''', or commonly named as '''Bank Central Asia''' ({{lang-zh|中亞銀行}}) abbreviated as ('''BCA''') is an Indonesian bank founded on February 21, 1957. In 2016, BCA overtook [[DBS Bank]] of Singapore as Southeast Asia's biggest lender by value, with a market capitalisation of US$24.5 billion (S$34.2 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/dbs-is-no-longer-se-asia-s-largest-bank-8177018|title=DBS is no longer SE Asia's largest bank|newspaper=[[Channel News Asia]] |date=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 had a tremendous impact on Indonesia's entire banking system. In particular, it affected BCA's cash flow and even threatened its survival. Panic rush forced the bank to seek assistance from the Indonesian government. The [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] took over control of the bank in 1998. Somehow full recovery was accomplished later in the same year. In December 1998, third-party funds were back at the pre-crisis level. BCA's assets stood at Rp 67.93&amp;nbsp;trillion, as opposed to Rp 53.36&amp;nbsp;trillion in December 1997. Public confidence in BCA was fully restored, and BCA was released by IBRA to BI in 2001.

[[File:Photograph of a vasco keypad.jpg|thumb|Key BCA: A vasco keypad as used by Bank Central Asia.]]
Subsequently, BCA took a major step by going public. The [[Initial public offering|IPO]] took place in 2000, selling 22.55% of BCA's shares that were being divested by IBRA. After the IPO, the agency still controlled 70.3% of BCA's total shares. The second Public Offering took place in June and July 2001, with IBRA divesting an additional 10% of its interest in BCA. In 2002, IBRA divested 51% of its BCA shares through a strategic private placement tender. The [[Mauritius]]-based Farindo Investment won the tender.
There is a BCA representative office in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://masnet.mas.gov.sg/fin/findir/SDWFIDIR.NSF/69af9793282a89864825635e00263a34/c611f0b773d7bb5c482565e9002af841?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the ATM’s networks and features were done intensively. BCA collaborated with a well-known institution, such as PT Telkom for phone bill payment through ATM BCA. BCA also collaborated with CitiBank so that BCA’s customers, who held CityBank’s credit card, can pay their bill through ATM BCA. 

In 2002, Farindo Investment (Mauritius) Limited took over 51% of BCA’s total shares through a strategic placement tender process. In 2004, BPPN divested 1,4% of BCA shares to domestic investors through limited offer and in 2005, the Government of Indonesia through PT Perusahaan Pengelolaan Aset (PPA) divested all of BCA’s remaining 5.02% shares.

In the 2000s BCA strengthened and expanded its products and services, especially electronic banking by introducing Debit BCA, Tunai BCA, internet banking KlikBCA, mobile banking m-BCA, EDCBIZZ, and others. BCA established the Disaster Recovery Center facility in Singapore. BCA increased its competence in lending, including through expansion into car finance through its subsidiary, BCA Finance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">A '''big boy letter''' is a pre-sale agreement  in connection with a private sale of [[securities]] (such as in a [[private investment in public equity|PIPE]] transaction) not to sue over non-disclosure of material inside information that is not disclosed, entered into between two [[Accredited investor|sophisticated parties]]. Big boy provisions may also be contained within securities purchase agreements, rather than being the subject of a separate letter agreement. Generally, a seller's request that a buyer agree to a big boy letter is a signal to the sophisticated buyer that there is likely to be [[Insider trading|material non-public information]] that exists concerning a security, which could give rise to a lawsuit brought by the buyer if it was not disclosed, in the absence of the letter.

==Controversy==
The legality of big boy letters themselves in the United States Securities markets is a matter of dispute.  This is because the primary lawsuit parties seek to avoid with such letters is one under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], which contains a provision, Section 29(a), that waivers of liability for securities fraud are void.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], which includes the financial District of [[New York (state)|New York]], has enforced agreements similar to big boy letters strictly against the buyer.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], which includes [[Delaware]], which is the state of incorporation for many publicly held companies, has given greater weight to the anti-waiver provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, although it has not completely ignored these agreements in considering all facts and circumstances of a transaction.  As of 2008, Commissioners and staff from the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] have expressed concern about the legal enforceability of big boy letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.morganlewis.com/~/media/559f00c122414562aef4197237935eee.ashx |title=Exchange Act Does Not Prohibit Big Boy Letters |date=December 16, 2014 |author=Susan DiCicco |publisher=Portfolio Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two commissioners have stated that even if the letters provide a defense in private securities litigation, that they are not a defense in an SEC enforcement action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgsh.com/news/newsdetail.aspx?news=231 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719011335/http://www.cgsh.com/news/newsdetail.aspx?news=231 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Even more controversial than the letters themselves is the practice of buying securities subject to a big boy letter and then reselling the securities to a third party without disclosing the existence of the "big boy letter." This practice is the subject of ongoing litigation and debate among persons familiar with securities markets.  Some argue that there is no duty to disclose the existence of the letter, because the buyer doesn't have any specific information.  Others argue that there is a duty to disclose the existence of a "big boy letter" because it strongly suggests that some material non-public information exists, even if the exact nature of that information is unknown, and that this practice, in effect, constitutes [[insider trading]].

A '''business improvement district''' ('''BID''') is a defined area within which businesses are required to pay an additional tax (or levy) in order to fund projects within the district's boundaries.  The BID is often funded primarily through the levy but can also draw on other public and private funding streams.  BIDs may go by other names, such as '''business improvement area''' ('''BIA'''), '''business revitalization zone''' ('''BRZ'''), '''community improvement district''' ('''CID'''), '''special services area''' ('''SSA'''), or '''special improvement district''' ('''SID''').  These districts typically fund services which are perceived by some businesses as being inadequately performed by government with its existing tax revenues, such as cleaning streets, providing security, making capital improvements, construction of pedestrian and streetscape enhancements, and marketing the area. The services provided by BIDs are supplemental to those already provided by the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Tennessee Development District, Chattanooga, TN. [http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf "Green Infrastructure Handbook."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023034/http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf |date=20 March 2012 }} January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue derives from a tax assessment on commercial property owners, and in some cases, residential property owners. 

==Development==
The first BID was the [[Bloor West Village]] Business Improvement Area, established in [[Toronto]] in 1970 as an initiative by local private business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jennifer | last = Yang | title = The birthplace of BIAs celebrates 40 years | date = 18 April 2010 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/797286--the-birthplace-of-bias-celebrates-40-years | work = Toronto Star | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BID in the United States was the [[Downtown New Orleans|Downtown Development District in New Orleans]], established in 1974. There are now 1,200 across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Matson | first = Patricia | title = Wilmington Downtown hopes to emulate Big Easy’s success | work = Lumina News | publisher = Workin4U, Inc | date = 17 February 2011 | url = http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30 | accessdate = 7 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062559/http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30# | archive-date = 29 September 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries with BIDs include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jamaica, Serbia, Albania, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The process for creating a BID varies from one jurisdiction to another. In the [[United States]], it generally involves three steps. First, some number of businesses in the area petition the local government to create the BID. Second, the local government determines that a majority of businesses want the BID. Third, the local government enacts legislation creating the BID. Prior to this occurring, state legislatures need to grant local units the authority to create BIDs.

BIDs in England and Wales are funded by a levy on the occupiers rather than the owners of the properties within the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Bids |title=Local authority guide to Business Improvement Districts |page=3 |date=October 2005 |url=http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008061849/http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; If voted in by local businesses, the BID levy is an extension to existing non-domestic business-rates. "In England and Wales, for a BID to go ahead the ballot must be won on two counts: straight majority and majority of rateable value. In Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour.  This ensures that the interests of large and small businesses are protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britishbids.info/AboutBIDs/WhatisaBID.aspx#AboutBIDs_BIDDev%20British%20Bids | title = What is a BID? | accessdate = 2010-10-12 | publisher = British BIDs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operating budgets of BIDs range from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A BID may be operated by a [[nonprofit organization]] or by a [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] entity. The governance of a BID is the responsibility of a board composed of some combination of property owners, businesses, and government officials. The management of a BID is the job of a paid administrator, usually occupying the position of an executive director of a management company.

==Distribution==

===United States===
{{main|Business Improvement Districts in the United States}} 
There are nearly 1,000 BIDs in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} New York City has 74 BIDs, the most of any city; in NYC, BIDs invest $134 million annually in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/bids.page|title=BIDs - SBS|website=www1.nyc.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. BIDs exist in almost every one of the top 50 largest cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. Minneapolis and Boston have been the last of the top 20 largest regions to adopt a business improvement district. The State of Wisconsin has adopted the most for smaller towns, with about 90 in the state{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, 25 of those being in Milwaukee and the rest throughout the state.

===Canada===
In Canada, Toronto has 81 BIAs within its city limit. [[Montreal]] – where BIAs are called Sociétés de Développement Commerciale (SDC) – has 17. The [[City of Winnipeg]] has 16 "Business Improvement Zones," the first of which were formed in 1987, with the amendment of The [[City of Winnipeg Act]]. In the province of [[Alberta]], they are termed "business revitalization zones". There are nine zones in the city of [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and 10 in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Regina, Saskatchewan has two Business Improvement Districts: Regina Downtown (BID) and The Warehouse District. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has 4 Business Improvement Districts: The Broadway BID, The Downtown Partnership, The Sutherland BID and The Riversdale BID. Some work has been made on creating a 5th BID in Saskatoon for the area of 33rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411232736/http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Push+continues+33rd+Street/8146530/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are over 400 BIDs in Canada but no count has been made. There are 8 business improvement districts in the Halifax Regional Municipality.  Halifax Regional Municipality has passed by laws in 2012 regarding the formation and conduct of these BIDs.
The 8 BIDS are: Downtown Halifax Business Commission, Downtown Dartmouth Business Commission, Spring Garden Area Business Association, North End Business Association, Quinpool Mainstreet and District Association Ltd. Sackville Business Association, Spryfield Business Association, Main Street Dartmouth Business Association.

BIDs have also become a powerful [[lobbying|lobby]] group, lobbying government for improvements such as new sidewalks, trees, park benches and other restorations. BIDs can also lobby different levels of government for a complete facelift on their area if they feel it is necessary to improve business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|title=Ottawa Business Journal|website=www.ottawabusinessjournal.com|accessdate=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011233655/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|archive-date=11 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rideau Street BIA in [[Ottawa]] has lobbied the city for years to give the entire street a face-lift because of its "run down" look.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===British BIDs===

[http://www.britishbids.info www.britishbids.info] is the industry body focused entirely on Business Improvement Districts.  
The organisation offers advice and services on BID development, management and renewal along with a range of training services and the [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/certificate-bid-management-2017/ Certificate in BID Management].

British BIDs conducts an annual [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/nationwide-bid-survey/ Nationwide BID Survey]. 2017 saw the publication of the 11th of these. The survey covers the fundamentals of a BID – number of businesses, types of businesses, levy rate and so on. It also asks questions about project delivery – what various BID's are delivering and how it works with other key strategic partners amongst other things. The survey provides the industry a real insight to the position at present.

British BIDs also produces the [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/industry-criteria/ Industry Criteria and Guidance] for developing and renewing BIDs alongside supporting organisations the  ATCM, Revo, ACS, BRC, intu and BPF.

British BIDs also administers the DCLG [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/the-bid-loan-fund/ BID Loan Fund] which supports developing BIDs.

In February 2017, Professor Chris Turner was appointed Chief Executive of British BIDs.

British BIDs have a Comprehensive renewal support package called [https://britishbids.info/services/ballot-buddy Ballot Buddy] which gives absolute confidence that the regs are adhered to and not at risk of a challenge.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|List of business improvement districts in London}}
In [[England and Wales]], BIDs were introduced through legislation (the [[Local Government Act 2003]]) and subsequent regulations in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cook | first = I. R. | title = Mobilising urban policies: The policy transfer of US Business Improvement Districts to England and Wales | work = Urban Studies, 45 (4), 773–795. | url = http://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cook-2008-Mobilising-urban-policies-Urban-Studies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Circle Initiative, a five-year scheme funded by the [[London Development Agency]], set up the first pilot BIDs, five in London, all of which had successful ballots by March 2006. [[Association of Town Centre Management]]-coordinated pilot 'talking shops' in 22 locations in England and Wales corresponded with the development of BIDs' regulations. As of October 2007 there were 36 proposed or operational BIDs across Greater London. By late 2014, there were over 180 BIDs in operation in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BID Intel Stats | url = https://www.bidintel.co.uk/bid-stats/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2017, there were 270 BIDs in the United Kingdom.

The [[New West End Company]] is the management and promotional company for [[Bond Street]], [[Oxford Street]] and [[Regent Street]].
As one of the largest Business Improvement Districts (BID) in Europe, New West End Company brings together the commercial interests of over 600 retailers, property owners and West End businesses working closely with the [[Mayor of London]], [[Transport for London]], [[Westminster City Council]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] and local neighbours in a collective vision to drive forward the nations retail heartland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newwestend.com/about-us/about-us About Us | New West End Company]. Newwestend.com (2013-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better [[Bankside]] was the third BID to be established in the UK, the second in London and the first south of the river. It was founded in 2005, and underwent a successful re-ballot in 2010 with 82% of businesses in favour.&lt;ref {{cite web |url=http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/our-last-ballot |title=Our Last Ballot |publisher=Better Bankside |accessdate=22 December 2013}} It is also notable for having won numerous awards, including Best Visitor Information Initiatives Silver Award in 2008, the Best Community Project 2011 and Best Partnership Award 2012 in the [[Mayor of London]]’s BID Awards, and was short-listed for Best Marketing &amp; Communications Campaign [[TfL]] Smarter Travel Awards 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/ Making Bankside a better place to live, work and visit]. Better Bankside. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Better Bankside BID was set up and is managed by [[The means]], a regeneration consultancy company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themeans.co.uk/ Welcome to]. The Means. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the Nottingham BID was successfully renewed by [http://www.centralmanagementsolutions.co.uk Central Management Solutions], a specialist management company for urban centres. This was particularly notable due to the fact that the BID merged the former leisure BID with the larger but, nonetheless, younger retail BID. The merger has led to combined services and aligned city promotions to consumers. 

In July 2015 the South Birmingham 'Lifford Bid' (Kings Norton, Cotteridge, Stirchley and Bournville) was rejected, with the Yes vote falling short with 45% of the vote.
 
====Scotland====
Business Improvement Districts Scotland (http://www.bids-scotland.com/) is the national organisation and voice for BIDs in Scotland. BIDS is responsible for delivering the Scottish Governments BIDs programme across Scotland, providing central support to developing BIDs, promoting and encouraging the development of BIDs across the country, whilst also working with operational BIDs to assist them in delivering for their local communities and contributing to sustainable inclusive economic growth. 

The Scottish Government provides a grant to local groups of up to £20,000 to help with the development of the BID. The legislation in Scotland (The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) is different from the England and Wales legislation in that it allows property owners as well as occupiers to be included in a BID. There are also differences in the timescales, ballot criteria (in Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour), reballot and the legislative requirements of the BID Proposer.  

The intention of the Scottish legislation is that BIDs are not restricted to towns and city centres to allow different and innovative BIDs to be developed across the country. The consultation of 2003 proposed that the BIDs model could be used in business parks, tourism and visitor areas, rural areas, agriculture and single business sectors. The legislation, and subsequent regulations were passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2006 and 2007 respectively. 

In March 2006, the Scottish Government announced funding for six pilot BIDs in Scotland, Bathgate (town centre), Clackmannanshire (business parks), Edinburgh (city centre), Falkirk (town centre), Glasgow (city centre) and Inverness (city centre). There are currently thirty seven operational BIDs in Scotland with a further twenty four in development. The thirty seven operational BIDs include thirty one town and city centre BIDs and three business park BIDs. 

In March 2014 the first tourism BID (TBID) was delivered in Loch Ness and Inverness (http://www.uniqueness.co.uk/)with others under discussion. The first themed BID in Scotland was delivered in December 2013, the Sauchiehall Street Evening Economy BID. In 2016 the worlds first Food and Drink BID was delivered in East Lothian (https://www.scotlandsfooddrinkcounty.com/) with the levy based on the number of full time employess, also a first. 

The development and interest in the BIDs model in Scotland continues to grow and the flexibility of the legislation and the model is now being recognised with the development of the Borders Railway BIDs Corridor and four Canal BIDs led by Scottish Waterways Trust. IN 2017 BIDs Scotland published The National Report on BIDs in Scotland (https://www.bids-scotland.com/about-us/the-national-report-on-bids-in-scotland-2017) which covers the types of BIDs, number of businesses, levels of employment in BIDs in Scotland and the contribution they make to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The opportunity for more innovative BIDs is under discussion. 

===Germany===
Six of the sixteen German Bundeslander (Federal States) introduced the requisite legal framework to create BIDs: Hamburg, Bremen, Hessen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein. BID projects in implementation exist only in a few German cities, yet – e.g. in Flensburg, Hamburg and Giessen.

==Criticism==

Whilst BIDs have been heralded for improving the trading environment, BIDs have also received noteworthy criticism.

BIDs have been accused of being by their very nature undemocratic, and that they concentrate power in a geographic area into the hands of the few.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Batchis, Business Improvement Districts and the Constitution: The Troubling Necessity of Privatized Government for Urban Revitalization, 38 [[Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly|Hastings Const. L.Q.]] 91 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Small businesses who fall below the BID levy threshold, although not liable to pay the BID levy, are often priced out of an area because BIDs tend to increase rental values. Larger businesses are more able to absorb these rent increases, particularly the multiple stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irelandafternama.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/the-retail-sector-business-improvement-districts-and-increasing-rents/|title=The Retail Sector, Business Improvement Districts and Increasing Rents|date=22 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIDs have also been criticized in the past by anti-poverty groups for being too harsh on the homeless and poor who may congregate around businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/nyregion/ex-outreach-workers-say-they-assaulted-homeless.html|title=Ex-Outreach Workers Say They Assaulted Homeless|first=Bruce|last=Lambert|date=14 April 1995|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIDs have also been known to be opposed to street vendors such as hot dog vendors and chip wagons.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In London, street traders who sold small items to tourists were barred from [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/street-traders-could-soon-be-barred-from-west-end-2029893.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Alistair | last1=Dawber | first2=Lydia | last2=Benatia | date=19 July 2010 | title=Street traders could soon be barred from West End}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of [[Civic Voice]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] criticised the creation of a BID in central London neighbourhood saying that is undemocratic: "Neither the people who live there, nor the many intriguing small shops and businesses, have been allowed to vote or have even been consulted.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/dont-let-business-in-to-destroy-unique-fitzrovia-8069360.html|title=Don’t let business in to destroy unique Fitzrovia|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I am wary of this initiative because of what may become [[unintended consequences]] (or indeed intended consequences) that help one sort of business (the property letting business) but will cause problems to smaller businesses and the large and wholly integrated residential population of the district".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/fight-this-undemocratic-attempt-to-manipulate-fitzrovia-into-something-it-is-not/ Griff Rhys Jones "We need to fight this undemocratic attempt to manipulate Fitzrovia into something it is not" Fitzrovia News, 24 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised some of the methods to oppose the BID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/writer-and-actor-criticises-bid-proposal-and-graffiti-campaign-against-it/|title=Writer and actor criticises BID proposal and graffiti campaign against it|date=24 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business relationship management''' ('''BRM''') is a formal approach to understanding, defining, and supporting inter-business activities related to [[business networking]].

Business relationship management consists of knowledge, skills, and behaviors (or ''competencies'') that foster a productive relationship between a service organization (e.g. [[Human Resources]], [[Information technology]], a finance department, or an external provider) and their business partners.

BRM is distinct from [[enterprise relationship management]] and [[customer relationship management]] although it is related. It is of larger scope than a [[liaison job|liaison]] who aligns business interests with [[Information Technology|IT]] [[deliverable]]s.&lt;ref name="brmit"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Business_Relationship_Manager# |title=Business Relationship Manager |access-date=2009-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317052007/http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Business_Relationship_Manager# |archive-date=2010-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends driving BRM development==
Strategic business partners (what used to be referred to as shared services or service providers) require a common methodology to drive true business innovation and strategy. These strategic business partners (IT, Finance, HR, external providers, etc.) are converging with the business. There is one shared business strategy with each business partner accountable for portions of the overall business value achieved.  Business Relationship Management Institute, Inc started promoting this business capability in 2012 with a non-profit membership community dedicated to the BRM profession. 
These features include:
* Business Relationship Management focuses on business value realization through accountable business partners
* advances in the scale, scope, and sophistication of the [[network effect]]
* constant disruption as the 'new normal' business dynamic&lt;ref name="newnormal"&gt;[http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bigshift/2009/01/the-new-reality-constant-disru.html The New Reality: Constant Disruption]&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of these trends on business relationships have driven the foundation of a distinct BRM discipline.

==Overview and goals==

BRM is implemented via organizational roles, a discipline, and an organizational capability.

===As a discipline===
The BRM discipline is research-based and has been verified and enhanced for over a decade. It is used in organizations worldwide and is effective for [[shared services]], external service providers and others. A goal of the discipline is to enable stakeholders to develop, evaluate, and use high-value networking relationships.

===As an organizational role===
The BRM organizational role is a link between a service provider and the business. The role acts as a connector, orchestrator, and navigator between the service provider and one or more business units.

===As a model===
One goal of BRM is to provide a complete model of business relationships and their value over time, in order to make their various aspects both explicit and measurable. A mature BRM model will ultimately support strategic business [[research and development]] efforts as well as tools and techniques that implement BRM principles.

The approach to the BRM modeling process is to identify and describe various aspects of business relationships in terms of:
* defined '''relationship types''', in which each type has a specified '''purpose''', associated '''roles''', and a measurable outcome
* a set of '''processes''' that make up the business relationship '''lifecycles'''
* a set of '''principles''' that apply specifically to these lifecycle processes

[[Asset]]s and products derived from the BRM model are meant to inform and support:
* A practice derived from applying BRM principles, analyzing outcomes, and refining over multiple iterations
* A platform derived from successful practice that further support and optimize BRM as a discipline

The BRM model will identify and categorize business relationships according to type. Each type has a discrete and clear purpose, characterized by a unique combination of roles, functions, and activities, and instances of each type can be identified, quantified, and analyzed. Some examples of these relationship types are business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and business-to-employee.

The BRM model identifies two roles, provider and [[consumer]]; a given business by necessity participates in both roles.

==BRM lifecycles==

The concept of the business relationship lifecycle&lt;ref name="lcvalue"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V69-4H8MP3J-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1d696c2baf837c3c35c8ba21c4559c8e Value creation in the relationship life cycle: A quasi-longitudinal analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lccapture"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V69-49JR23M-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=eabd93bc24a731a47207082c5bccf62e Capturing value creation in business relationships: A customer perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; builds on charting the complex changing values of business relationships over time in contrast to simple [[financial transaction|transactional value]].

Examples of BRM lifecycles include:
* A large-scale grow and sustain cycle, characterized by one-to-many and many-to-one relationships. Activities in this cycle are more or less continuous and overlapping, such as [[marketing]], customer [[product support]] or maintenance, or [[online community]]. These have indeterminate outcomes.
* A small-scale (micro) engagement cycle, characterized by one-to-one, discrete or transactional relationships. These have discrete cycles and negotiated outcomes.

==BRM principles==
;Measurement and analysis
The goals of BRM require that its concepts and principles be identifiable and measurable. Given the model, a person should be able to identify the business relationships that they are engaged in, and measure them in terms like quantity or duration. The same holds for any aspect of BRM, such as type, role, or principle.

;Purpose
Every business relationship has a purpose that requires the participation of multiple roles to accomplish. The purpose of a given business relationship is discrete and quantifiable.

;Reputation and trust
The BRM model should attempt to model and quantify [[reputation]] and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].

Every relationship, and every interaction within it, contributes to reputation. Reputation mitigates risk and reduces friction within business processes. Concern for reputation incentivizes good behavior.

Absence of trust will cause a business relationship to fail. Trust increases efficiency and enables conflict resolution. The relationship between trust as a traditional core concept&lt;ref name="trustcore"&gt;[http://trustedadvisor.com/cgreen.articles/38/Trust-in-Business-The-Core-Concepts Trust in Business: The Core Concepts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110032155/http://trustedadvisor.com/cgreen.articles/38/Trust-in-Business-The-Core-Concepts |date=November 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in its emerging 'radical' form as a component of online community&lt;ref name="trustrad"&gt;[http://www.radicaltrust.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/radical_trust.pdf Radical Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; must be described.

;Governance
The BRM model needs to account for and align with models of [[corporate governance]], including [[business ethics]], legal constraints, and social norms as they apply to business relationships.

;Boundaries
The BRM model should define the boundaries of business relationships within the larger continuum of interpersonal relationships. In addition to governance issues, the model should examine if there are optimal levels of personal connection, and whether they differ by type, role, or other attribute. The model should help define boundaries that optimize effectiveness while supporting good governance practices.

;Exchange and reciprocity
The BRM model of exchange and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] must extend traditional dimensions to account for not only financial exchange, but also time, money, knowledge, and reputation exchanges. These are a key feature of business relationships.

==Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI)==
In 2013, the Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI) was founded, which publishes a guide that offers a "comprehensive foundation-level overview of the art and practice of Business Relationship Management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The BRMP® Guide to the BRM Body of Knowledge. | ISBN = 978-9401800228 |year = 2014 |publisher = Van Haren Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRMI offers a Business Relationship Management Professional (BRMP) designation, as well as a Certified Business Relationship Manager (CBRM) designation. These are globally accredited and administered by their partner, APMG-International.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9436">'''Claude Grunitzky''' (born February 28, 1971) is a journalist, editor and entrepreneur. A graduate of the [[University of London]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], he is best known as founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle publication TRACE, an international fashion and music title, and as a co-founder of the [[TRACE TV]] network. He runs [http://www.trueafrica.co TRUE Africa], a media platform championing young African voices, and [http://www.true212.com TRUE],  a content marketing agency, and is often involved in organizing international cultural exhibitions and events. Grunitzky is the president of the Byrd Hoffman Water Mill Foundation, an arts organization overseeing the Watermill Center,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.watermillcenter.org&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a supportive environment for emerging artists to explore new ideas. In 2012, Grunitzky's career was the subject of a [[Harvard Business School]] case study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41383&lt;/ref&gt; which is taught in the "Power &amp; Influence" MBA class.

== Biography ==
Grunitzky was born in and grew up in the Togolese capital of [[Lomé]]. His greatuncle was [[Nicolas Grunitzky]], former president of Togo. His paternal great-grandfather was [[Poles|Polish]] hence his surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/le-monde-2/article/2008/09/19/trace-tv-business-urbain_1096976_1004868.html |title=Trace TV, business urbain |last1=Valo |first1=Martine |date=19 September 2008 |website=lemonde.fr |publisher=[[Le Monde]] |access-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afrik.com/article21092.html |title=Trace TV, business urbain |last1=Epou |first1=Kodjo |date=19 November 2010 |website=www.afrik.com/ |publisher=afrik.com |access-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Grunitzky was eight years old, his family left Togo for the United States, where his father had been appointed ambassador to Washington. Four years later, Grunitzky moved to France to study at the Catholic boarding school College de Juilly and, later, at the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris [[Sciences-Po]].

At the age of 20, Grunitzky moved to London after a year at Sciences Po, to pursue studies in economics at London University. It was there that he embarked on his career in journalism, meeting [[Jefferson Hack]] and writing for [[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]], [[The Big Issue]] and [[The Guardian]]. In 1995, at the age of 24, he launched TRUE magazine, which met with immediate critical success and was renamed TRACE a year later. In 1998, he uprooted to New York and oversaw the magazine as it carved a niche for itself in the world of independent publishing, with its own distinctive brand of transcultural reportage. As the magazine grew in influence, he co-founded TRUE Agency, a specialized advertising agency based in New York and Los Angeles. In February 2003, Grunitzky and business partners Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez completed a multimillion-dollar financing deal led by [[Goldman Sachs]] Group. As a result, the TRACE brand is now being leveraged globally across various television, mobile, event and interactive platforms.

Grunitzky, a frequent contributor to the French weekly “[[Courrier International]],” has worked as an associate producer on the [[BBC]]’s “The Works” series. He currently advises global corporations and governments in the fields of digital innovation and content strategy. In 2008, Grunitzky co-curated, with the cultural services of the French Embassy in the United States, the “I Kiffe NY” festival,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frenchculture.org&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to bringing the best of French urban culture to New York City. Grunitzky is also a board member of [[Humanity in Action]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanityinaction.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization which works to build global leadership, defend democracy, protect minorities and improve human rights in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United States. In December 2013, Grunitzky became a director at the World Policy Institute,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldpolicy.org&lt;/ref&gt; a non-partisan source of informed policy leadership. In January 2015, Grunitzky was elected to the board of trustees of avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson's &lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertwilson.com&lt;/ref&gt; Watermill Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.watermillcenter.org&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, he was appointed president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/07/claude-grunitzky-named-first-president-of-the-byrd-hoffman-water-mill-foundation/&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Grunitzky was elected to the board of trustees of [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MASS MoCA), one of the world’s liveliest centers for making and enjoying today’s most evocative art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massmoca.org&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Sloan Fellow at the [http://mitsloan.mit.edu/ MIT Sloan School of Management ] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Grunitzky earned an [[MBA]]. In November 2011, he was appointed a lecturer on "Thought Leadership" during [[MIT]]'s Sloan Innovation Period. In September 2015, he officially announced the launch of his new venture, TRUE Africa [http://trueafrica.co].

In 2017 Grunitzky was named President of the Byrd Hoffman Water Mill Foundation, which operates [[The Watermill Center]], an international center for the arts and humanities founded by theater artist [[Robert Wilson (director) | Robert Wilson]] in 1991 on Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name="grunitzky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/07/claude-grunitzky-named-first-president-of-the-byrd-hoffman-water-mill-foundation/|title=Claude Grunitzky Named First President of the Byrd Hoffman Water Mill Foundation|first=Carolyn|last=Twersky|date=7 July 2017|website=artnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ventures ==
'''TRACE Magazine'''

Born out of the short-lived TRUE magazine, [[Trace (magazine)|TRACE]] was started by Grunitzky in London in 1996. Beginning life as predominantly an urban culture magazine, [[Trace (magazine)|TRACE]]’s identity was quickly influenced by Grunitzky’s nascent interest in what he termed ‘transculturalism’ – a phenomenon referring to those individuals who, in their lifestyles, transcend all traditional sociological notions of race, class or gender.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frenchculture.org/spip.php?article1772&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transculturalim: How the World is Coming Together, by Claude Grunitzky (powerHouse, 2004) {{ISBN|1-57687-218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the magazine’s front pages continued to feature stellar figures from the hip hop and R&amp;B scenes, including [[Alicia Keys]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Rihanna]], the establishment of ‘country themed’ issues, beginning with ‘Brasil 2000’, marked a clear step in the direction of an explicitly international approach to popular culture.

'''TRUE Agency'''
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2002, Grunitzky co-founded the [http://www.true212.com TRUE], Agency, a marketing agency based in Los Angeles, in partnership with business partner Richard Wayner and the [[TBWA\Worldwide]] group.&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD8123CF93BA15751C0A9659C8B63&lt;/ref&gt; The agency currently operates out of London, Paris and New York.

'''TRACE Television''' 
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2003, Grunitzky also launched [http://www.trace.tv TRACE TV], the world’s first global urban music channel, with Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez, in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Groupe Lagardère. [http://www.trace.tv TRACE TV], which is now broadcast in over 150 countries, was successfully sold to European investors in July 2010, ending Grunitzky's involvement with the company.

'''TRUE Africa''' 
&lt;br /&gt;
Launched in September 2015, TRUE Africa is a media-tech platform focused on the next thinking on culture, music, sports, lifestyle, politics, fashion and tech in Africa and the diaspora. Grunitzky has stated that TRUE Africa's editors want to discover and champion young African voices all over the world. In November 2016, TRUE Africa secured funding from [[Google]]'s Digital News Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com&lt;/ref&gt; which supports innovation in journalism.

'''Claude Nobs''' (February 4, 1936 – January 10, 2013) was the founder and general manager of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

==Biography==
[[File:Claude Nobs.jpg|thumb|upright|Nobs introducing the [[Bill Evans Trio]] at [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], July 12, 1978]]
Nobs was born in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. After apprenticing as a cook, Nobs worked in the Tourism Office of Montreux. He later went to New York, where he met [[Nesuhi Ertegün]], the then-president of [[Atlantic Records]]. He also met [[Roberta Flack]] and invited her to the ''Rose d’Or de Montreux''. Later, [[Aretha Franklin]] made her first visit to Europe thanks to him.

At the age of 31, while he was director of the Tourism Office of Montreux, he organized the first jazz festival featuring artists such as [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Keith Jarrett]], Ron McLure and [[Jack DeJohnette]]. This new festival was an immediate success, and gained a reputation far beyond Switzerland. Nobs quickly transformed his festival into an international gathering place for lovers of jazz.

In 1971, [[Deep Purple]] decided to produce and record their album [[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]] in Montreux. The group was also scheduled to record at the [[Montreux Casino]], shortly after [[Frank Zappa]] performed. During Zappa's concert, the venue caught fire and reduced the Casino to ashes. Nobs saved several young people who had hidden in the casino, thinking they would be sheltered from the flames. Nobs, who had served as a volunteer fireman, knew that the casino was not actually a safe place and acted immediately to get them out. This act earned him a mention (in the line ''Funky Claude was running in and out pulling kids out the ground'') in the song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", which is about the incident. Also, on the inner liner of the original album, Nobs' picture was the only one labeled with a name other than those of the band members themselves.

In 1973, Nobs became the director of the Swiss branch of Warner, Elektra and Atlantic. &lt;!-- Atlantic produit des artistes de référence qui viennent jouer à Montreux l'été. --&gt; On the live [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] album ''[[Bursting Out]]'' (recorded on 28 May 1978 in [[Bern]]), one can hear Nobs announcing "Gueten Abig mitenand, und herzlich willkommen in der Festhalle Bern!" (Good evening everybody -in [[Swiss German]]-, and welcome to the Festhall of Bern).

During the 1990s, Nobs shared the directorship of the festival with [[Quincy Jones]], and made [[Miles Davis]] an honorary host. The festival continued to diversify and was no longer exclusively devoted to jazz.

In 2004, the festival attracted 200,000 visitors. On 25 September 2004, Nobs received the Tourism Prize of Salz &amp; Pfeffer. The [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of Vaud gave him the "Prix du Rayonnement" for his contributions to music. He has also received an honorary doctorate.

Nobs played harmonica on the opening track of the 1983 [[Chris Rea]] album [[Water Sign (Chris Rea album)|Water Sign]].

In 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Montreux_founder_reveals_his_winning_formula.html?cid=4582508 |title=Montreux founder reveals his winning formula |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=24 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the referendum campaign on [[registered partnership in Switzerland]] for same-sex couples he came out publicly to support the new law. At the time, Claude Nobs had been in a relationship with his partner, Thierry Amsallem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/En-perdant-Claude-Nobs-le-plus-grand-festival-du-monde-est-orphelin/story/24228468 |title=En perdant Claude Nobs, le plus grand festival du monde est orphelin |publisher= Tribune de Genève |date=11 January 2013 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1987.

On 24 December 2012, he had an accident while [[Nordic skiing]] in [[Switzerland]] and fell into a coma. Nobs died on 10 January 2013 at age 76.&lt;ref name=Death&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''creative professional''' who is also known as a '''creative specialist''' is a person who is employed for the extraction of skills in creative endeavors. Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, scientific research and development, product development, engineering, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be doubled.

==History==
Although creative professionals have been a part of the workforce for more than 500 years, several events during the past decade have altered industry and public perception of these workers.

The change in status began in the late 1990s when demand for creative workers was high due to the internet boom. Creative workers found that their talents in [[graphic design|graphic]] and interactive design were valuable, and so, the workers began to develop independent cultures in select cities throughout the world, notably [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]] and [[Boston]]. Some smaller cities, such as [[Austin]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] also became centers where creative people found abundant opportunity. This trend has been documented in author [[Richard Florida]]'s book, The Creative Class.

As the creative workforce has evolved in the post-dot.com era, creative workers have continued to flourish. [[Daniel H. Pink]]'s book ''A Whole New Mind'' describes the transition in American business from [[information age]] to conceptual age. Pink describes information-era jobs as expendable and exportable, and offers that the [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] may yield more value for newer American workers than the [[MBA]] might generate in today's economy.

The Creative Professional, by Howard Blumenthal, describes the phenomenon from yet another perspective: that of the individual worker now emerging as a serious business professional with specific skills on par with lawyers, accountants, doctors, and other workers who are perceived to be within a special class. The book describes the unique business and career issues for the individual creative worker.

==Expansion of scope and study==
To date, most of the information about this growing phenomenon exists in book form. Many of the ideas and mechanisms are related to changes in copyright law, as described by [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Creative Commons]].

University education for creative professionals is often presented under older definitions of music, art, and related disciplines, but the processes related to creative thought, particularly as they apply to work, are found in books about cognitive psychology. Author and cognitive thinking researcher [[Howard Gardner]] has defined a variety of intelligences related to creative workers. Psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] has described the process of creative work effectively in several books, including Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. Professors in Business have also started to explore the success factors for creative professionals including Harvard Business School Professor [[Teresa Amabile]] who has studied and published research on creative professionals like author John Irving &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mallory Stark and Martha Lagace|title=John Irving's Lessons for Business|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2000.html|year=2001|accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Corporate research and the development of products and services specifically for creative professionals has started to crop up as companies hire increasing numbers of creative professionals to compete on innovation. Recent changes to corporate slogans are indicative of the trend. In 2003, GE's slogan changed from "We Bring Good Things To Life" to "Imagination at Work" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McCarthy|title='Imagination at Work' for GE|publisher=USA TODAY|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2003-05-04-ge_x.htm|accessdate=2007-05-28 | date=2003-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hewlett Packard adopted the slogan "Invent."

Creativity, such as poetic creativity, has been an area of fascination for many ancient traditions.   For example, Nasadiya Sukta the Hindu creation hymn states "Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought, but who really knows how creation happened?".

==History==
[[File:Flatiron Building Holyoke, Mass.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The offices of D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower resided in Holyoke's Flatiron Building, also known as the Parsons Block, designed by [[William Ferro Pratt]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Western Massachusetts; Holyoke—The New Block of the Parsons Paper Company|work=Springfield Republican|date=February 14, 1874|page=6|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sign for their firm can be seen between the 2nd and 3rd floors.]]
David Tower, the senior partner of the firm, first entered the business of engineering paper mills as an apprentice millwright in 1845 at the age of 13, and eventually moved his own practice to Holyoke in 1867.&lt;ref name="paperworld"/&gt; Receiving a steady stream of work, David gradually brought on other draftsmen and was joined in 1871 by his younger brother Ashley B. Tower, who he mentored as his own apprentice. By 1878, Ashley Tower had become accustomed to the trade and an influx of business led to him being made the firm's junior partner, which became best known as D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower.&lt;ref name="abtowermem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhobit"/&gt;

From 1878 until 1892, the brothers Tower would produce some of their most prolific work. During this time the brothers furnished designs on mills and mill machinery in Holyoke, from Maine to California in the continental United States, and abroad on five continents. While an exact figure is unknown, in a [[cross-examination]] of Ashley Tower in a court case between the City of Holyoke and the Holyoke Water Power Company in 1899, Tower stated that of the mills built in Holyoke up until that time, he had been involved in the construction of 25 in some capacity, 16 of which were done in a central design role. While it is unclear from this testimony what share of work was done by each brother and how many of those mills designed were in the seven years following David's retirement Ashley Tower stated he had worked on more than 55 mills in key engineering roles, and more than 100 in any capacity.&lt;ref name="testimony"/&gt;

At the beginning of their partnership the firm was located in the Hadley Falls Bank Building which sat at the corner of Main and Dwight (not to be confused with the later Hadley Falls Trust Building at the corner of Maple &amp; Suffolk),&lt;ref name="abtowerobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Noted Paper Mill Builder- Death of Ashley B.

Originally Ashley B. Tower joined David H. as an apprentice, with no prior experience in engineering work or architecture besides his previous apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="abtowerobit"/&gt; In time his abilities exceeded his older brother's in certain regards; of the two, he was the only one known to hold patents- by 1885, he had invented an improved wood pulp grinder which would be used in their clients' mills domestically and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US | inventor      = A.B.

[[File:Rio_Tietê_-_Cidade_de_Salto_1.jpg|right|thumb|290px|The sloping banks of [[Rio Tietê]] at [[Salto, São Paulo]], the site where a large paper industry was begun through the mill designs of the brothers.]]
One of the things that reportedly made their firm successful was their study of foreign as well as domestic designs, with reports that the Towers went abroad to Europe in 1884-1885 to examine the latest designs in paper mills on that continent.&lt;ref name="abtowermem"/&gt; Moreover, their firm placed a far greater emphasis on the surroundings of the sites at which their mills were constructed, rendering otherwise challenging terrain into the driving force of a mill's productivity.&lt;ref name="inland"/&gt; Among notable examples of this is the site of the Melchert &amp; Cia Mill in [[Salto, São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. Designed and built in 1887 on the banks of the [[Tietê River]], at the time of its construction it was regarded as a folly by locals, who mocked Melchert &amp; Cia, its wealthy Brazilian backers, for "[the] insane idea of manufacturing paper in that country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Inland Printer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5j4_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273|title=Paper Making in Brazil|page=273|volume=VII|issue=3|date=December 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by the brothers Tower, it became the first industrial paper mill in South America and remains a functional site even today, producing large quantities of paper for currency.&lt;ref name="brazil1"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Inland Printer|page=701|volume=4|title=Paper Trade Items|quote=D.

The mill has been modernized and it manufacturers special paper and it is one of the few paper mills in the world to manufacture paper for coining currency|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the brothers' methodical research can be found in the construction of the, since demolished, Hampden County Jail. When first contracted for the design, the two not only consulted with county authorities through their several drafts of the facility's design, but personally travelled through a number of states to obtain the best working ideas for penitentiaries at that time.&lt;ref name="paperworld"/&gt;

They were described by several accounts as having being known internationally, with projects engineered by them in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, India, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and Central American nations as well. Toward the end of their partnership, one account reports their company established a department devoted entirely to commercial and residential structures as well.&lt;ref name="inland"/&gt; Their architectural styles varied on the practicality of the project in question, and [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] motifs can be found in their more ornate work. As if in jest, referencing their family name, the brothers were known for prominently featuring literal towers in their work, often decorative in nature, with faux [[battlements]].&lt;ref name="ragtime"/&gt;
[[File:Massasoit.png|thumb|left|250px|The Massasoit; built in Holyoke in 1891, it was a rare example of the firm's residential work. The terra cotta centerpiece, featuring the profile of the [[massasoit|Wampanoag chief]] remains at the corner of Chestnut and Essex, set in concrete.]]

By 1897 the landscape of the [[Holyoke Canal System]] had become crowded with mills, with relatively little water power remaining for new projects. This, combined with demand for larger-scaled operations and ready access to raw material led Tower &amp; Wallace to relocate to New York City, where the firm would remain for the next several years.&lt;ref name="remi2"/&gt; It was reported by the end of the brothers' partnership that all of their architectural and mechanical designs, some 8,000 drawings were stored in a series of safes in the third floor of the Flatiron block for the purpose of preserving the designs for their clients in case of an emergency,&lt;ref name="pictur"/&gt; the fate of these plans remains unknown, however following Ashley Tower's death in 1901, the assets of the former Tower firm in New York were purchased by their former draftsman George F. Hardy, who maintained his own engineering business in that city thereafter.&lt;ref name="gfhardy"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Hardy, George Fiske|title=Who's Who in America|volume=VII|page=913|editor1-last=Marquis|editor1-first=Albert Nelson|year=1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4MGW6mbi0QC&amp;pg=PA913&amp;lpg=PA913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
[[File:Draughting Room Corner.png|320px|right|thumb|Draftsmen in the Tower offices, circa 1892]]

In their time the two were "widely regarded as the best paper mill architects in the world", attributed to the fact that the brothers employed both civil and mechanical engineering and made thorough study of sites to employ natural power in their architectural plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wisconsin's Own: Twenty Remarkable Homes|page=73|quote=Lacking funding from Alfred s father, Alfred and Havilah approached Franklyn C. Shattuck, a salesman, and Charles Clark, a Civil War veteran and hardware store owner, about combining financial resources. In 1872 the four put together $30,000 to start the paper company. A year later the group hired D. H. and A. B. Towers, architects and civil engineers, to retrofit the Reliance Mill and to build their mills in Appleton, De Pere, and Kimberly, Wisconsin. (The Towers brothers were widely regarded as the best paper mill designers in the world, having built mills across the United States and even in China. Their genius came from the fact they knew no two paper mills were alike: water power required a careful site analysis for the effective transmission of power, so each mill had to be designed to respond to the specific site.)|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|year=2010|last1=Connolly|first1=M. Caren|last2=Wasserman|first2=Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their deaths, the two brothers were praised like royalty, with Ashley Tower, described in one trade journal as "the [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of paper and pulp mill engineering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Engineering Record|volume=55|date=January 12, 1907|title=Changes in a Large Engineering Organization|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ1EAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA787|author1=Mehren|first1=Edward J|last2=Meyer|first2=Henry Coddington|last3=Goodell|first3=John M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Tower touted by [[William Randolph Hurst|William Randolph Hearst's]] national news service as "the Paper King".&lt;ref name="hearst"&gt;{{cite news|title=D.

During the firm's time under the handle "D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower", the two designed at least 100 or so mills,&lt;ref name="testimony"/&gt; and this does not include those which had been designed and constructed by either brother individually before or after their dissolution, nor does this include the many works of their pupils, some of whom had served as A.B. Tower's junior partners in the years after 1892.

One entry for their office in 1890 described their office as employing 12-15 staff,&lt;ref name="paperworld"/&gt; whereas other accounts describe as many as 35,&lt;ref name="employ"/&gt; including stenographers, draughtsmen and civil engineers. The latter proved to become as much a legacy of the firm as their dozens of mills, as Joseph Wallace later described- "a number of the noteworth pulp and paper mills erected in America have been entrusted to 'Tower' graduates."&lt;ref name="wallaceppp"/&gt;

Among these was George F. Hardy, who worked with the brothers starting in 1888, and become the junior partner of the firm a year after David's departure, from 1893 to 1896. Hardy would go on to become [[International Paper|International Paper's]] first chief engineer, overseeing the logistics and technical work of operating its 17 mills when it first merged in 1898&lt;ref name="gfhardy"/&gt; He would ultimately leave this post in 1901, only to acquire the Towers' business in its last iteration in New York City, including a number of assets Ashley Tower left behind following his sudden death. Rechristened as George F. Hardy &amp; Son, he would continue to build upon the legacy of his former employers, designing dozens of paper mills internationally for several more decades.&lt;ref name="gfhardy2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardy, George Fiske|website=Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada, 1800-1950|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522161439/http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/2025|archive-date=May 22, 2018|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/2025|last=Hill|first=Robert G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; So prominent became is work that he would later be described in a 1908 Congressional hearing on the industry as "the famous paper and pulp mill architect of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pulp and Paper Investigation Hearings|volume=I|year=1909|publisher=Government Printing Office (GPO)|location=Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7pJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Horatio Tower''' (March 7, 1832 – December 22, 1907)&lt;ref name="westmasshist"/&gt; was born to Stephen Dyer Tower and Esther Eliza Tower (née Beal) on March 7, 1832, in [[Cummington, Massachusetts]]; he was the eldest of their ten children. When he was 3 years old, his family moved to [[Windsor, Massachusetts]]. Tower was educated at a small country school there until the age of 13, at which time he entered an apprenticeship with a local millwright.&lt;ref name="dhnyt"/&gt;
 
His first notable job was his work in rebuilding the [[Crane Currency|Crane Company's]] Red Mill of Dalton in 1846, which had been originally erected four years earlier by industrialist and papermaker [[Zenas Crane]].&lt;ref name="westmasshist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhobit"/&gt; This would be the first of many such projects that would characterize his career. Until his death in 1907, Tower was prolific in the construction, remodeling, and engineering of numerous paper mills as well as facilities for other industries. His work was wide-ranging, from the design of stationary buildings such as business blocks and residences, to the engineering of mechanical equipment such as dams and waterwheels.

On July 2, 1859, Tower married Margaret Young, of Glasgow, Scotland; the couple bore one son, Walter Lamont, who was born in Dalton on December 26, 1868. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Tower, 6&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (1.98m) in stature, was exempt from the draft due to [[scoliosis]].&lt;ref name="dhobit"/&gt;

Among those mills which David Tower was specifically identified with were the four paper mills of the Crane company of Dalton, Massachusetts, which continues to produce paper for the United States Treasury, as well as a number of foreign governments. He also worked closely with [[Byron Weston]] to develop paper mills in Dalton and Windsor, Connecticut. The very last mill Tower would design was the Pioneer Mill &amp; Company, also built in Dalton.&lt;ref name="dhobit"/&gt;

In retirement he continued to do some work, including a dam to the local Egypt Reservoir in Dalton.&lt;ref name="egypt"&gt;{{cite report|title=Egypt Reservoir Dam, Phase I Inspection Report|publisher=National Dam Inspection Program, Army Corps of Engineers|pages=1–3|url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA155385#page/n17/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; David was also an avid breeder of [[Jersey cattle]], and was recorded in 1885 as having 20 cows and 9 sheep on his farm "Sunnyside" in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of Berkshire County, Mass., 1725-1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3YUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=78|last=Child|first=Hamilton|year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life he had remained an active Congregationalist, but was not known to be a member of any fraternities, service organizations, or clubs. Having retired from business some years prior, David Tower died at his farm, "Sunnyside", in Dalton at 2pm on December 22, 1907; he was 75.&lt;ref name="dhobit"/&gt; In a nationally syndicated obituary, the [[International News Service|Hearst News Service]] lauded Tower "the Paper King," describing him as "one of the greatest paper manufacturers in the world".&lt;ref name="hearst"/&gt; He was interred at Main St Cemetery in Dalton, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave | 74168464 | David Horatio Tower | accessdate=May 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley Bemis Tower''' (June 26, 1847 – July 8, 1901) was born to Stephen Dyer Tower and Esther Eliza Tower on June 26, 1847, in [[Windsor, Massachusetts]]; he was the youngest of their ten children. When he was 7 years old, the family relocated to [[Dalton, Massachusetts]], where he received he attended school and worked with his father on the family farm.

In 1868 Tower left for [[Newburg, New York]] where he took up [[carpentry]] with one of his older brothers. Following this, he moved to [[Holyoke]] in 1871 where he studied engineering under his aforementioned brother David.

In 1875 he married Pamelia J. Fritts. Having gradually learned the millwright trade from his brother, he became the junior partner of D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower in 1878. In order to keep their firm competitive and abreast of the latest developments in industrial architecture, Ashley Tower travelled twice to Europe to study foreign construction methods of paper mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Architect A.B.

During this time Tower also served as City Engineer for Holyoke from 1881 to 1883, introducing reforms to that office.&lt;ref name="masstoday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Massachusetts of To-Day|page=404|url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettsoft00toom/massachusettsoft00toom#page/404/mode/2up|location=Boston|publisher=Columbia Publishing Company|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same time he also designed the grounds of the city's Calvary Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allyn|first=George H.| title=Thirtieth Anniversary Sketch, Holyoke Daily Transcript, 1882-1912 | year=1912 | publisher=[[Holyoke Transcript-Telegram|The Transcript Publishing Co.]] | oclc= 24571746 |url = https://archive.org/stream/holyokedailytran00ally#page/n143/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a consulting engineer of the American Sulphite Company.&lt;ref name="mechtrans"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|volume=22|page=1156|title=Members Deceased During the Year: Ashley B.

Tower and others for an act of incorporation as, 274; notice of reference by House to next General Court, 312|location=Boston|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1892, Tower bought out his brother's interest in the partnership, becoming the sole proprietor of the firm.&lt;ref name="paperworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="masstoday"/&gt; He continued the business at their original location for the following year before partnering with George F. Hardy and becoming '''A.B. Tower &amp; Company''', a name which would be retained until 1896 upon Hardy leaving to pursue other opportunities.

Following a growth in business, Tower relocated to [[New York City]] in 1897 and partnered with civil engineer Joseph H. Wallace as his junior member under the firm Tower &amp; Wallace. Reflecting the changes of the times, time firm began focusing on steel office building work in addition to the core clientele of paper mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|page=18|title=Mr. Tower...|work=The American Architect|volume=LXXIII|number=1332|date=July 6, 1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQJaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This firm name remained until February 1901 when Wallace left to pursue an independent career; Tower however remained active in his trade right until his death. On July 8, 1901, Ashley Tower died suddenly at his home in [[Montclair, New Jersey]] at the age of 54.

When the [[American Writing Paper Company]] trust went into business in 1899, Ashley Tower was among those hired to appraise its assets, having been involved in the design of many of them himself.
At the time of his death he was in the midst of drawing plans for a large mill building in [[New Brunswick]]. While no works are known, an obituary reported he had done design work on a number of New York [[skyscrapers]] in his final years.&lt;ref name="abtowerobit"/&gt;

Tower was described as "domestic in his tastes"&lt;ref name="masstoday"/&gt; and enjoying his library and a private art collection. In contrast with his elder brother who refrained from participating in social or professional organizations, Ashley was a member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], as well as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], and [[Canadian Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0gwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA463|chapter=Ch. 111: An Act to authorize the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers to admit Ashley Bemis Tower as a member|page=463|language=English|title=Statutes of the Province of Quebec passed in the First Year of the Reign of His Majesty Edward the Seventh, and in the First Session of the Tenth Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley also was an active [[freemason]], being a member of not only the [[blue lodge]] but also a [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]], and 32nd degree mason of the [[Scottish Rite]]. He was reportedly also very fond of [[horsemeat]], and kept a stable of about a dozen horses.&lt;ref name="abtowerobit"/&gt;

On July 8, 1901, Tower died rather suddenly at his home in [[Montclair, New Jersey]] of "[[heat prostration]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Engineering Record|page=41|volume=44|date=July 13, 1901|title=Personal and Obituary Notes|quote=Ashley B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">'''David Ford''' (born 1944) is a British organizational theorist, Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Bath School of Management]], and co-founder of the [[International Marketing and Purchasing Group]] (IMP Group) in the mid 1970s. He is known for his work with [[Håkan Håkansson]] on [[business network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Cyril. "Interdependencies, trust and information in relationships, alliances and networks." ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'' 26.2 (2001): 161-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, Evert.

''Journal of Relationship Marketing'' 1.1 (2002): 37-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ford obtained his BSc in Mechanical Engineering at the [[University of Salford]], his MSc at the [[University of Bradford]], and his PhD at the [[Manchester Business School]]. In 2007 he was awarded an Honorary Degree from the [[Uppsala Universitet]], Sweden for developing "a worldwide system for improving the way companies interact with customers and suppliers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2007/10/25/sweden-degree.html Honorary degree for researcher who improved customer-supplier relations]," ''Internal News,'' University of Bath, 25 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford started his academic career at the University of Bath as lecturer, and promoted to senior lecturer, reader and in 1989 Professor of Marketing. In 2008 he retired as Emeritus Professor, and became Affiliate Professor at [[KEDGE Business School]] in Marseille, France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedgebs.com/sites/default/files/cv/cvsep12.pdf DAVID FORD, Curriculum Vitae] at kedgebs.com. Accessed 28.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he was co-founder of the [[Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group]] (IMP group).&lt;ref&gt;''International Journal of Technology Management.'' Vol. 14, Nr. 5-8. (1997) p. 596.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ford's research interests are in the field of "relationships between companies develop and how they can be managed effectively. It also involves issues of technological development within and between companies. I am currently working as part of the team on the "Newmark" project. This study is looking at ways in which complex networks of companies operate and how companies behave within them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/faculty/david_ford.html David Ford - University of Bath] at ''bath.ac.uk.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6140">{{short description|Satirical observation by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams}}
The '''Dilbert principle''' is a concept in [[management]] developed by [[Scott Adams]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Dilbert]]'', which states that companies tend to systematically promote [[Competence (human resources)|incompetent]] employees to management to get them out of the workflow. The Dilbert principle is inspired by the [[Peter principle]], which holds that employees are promoted based on success in their current position until they reach their "level of incompetence" and are no longer promoted. Under the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book ''The Dilbert Principle''.

==Definition==
In the ''Dilbert'' strip of February 5, 1995, [[Dogbert]] says that "leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow". Adams himself explained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funny Business |author= |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/bized/p16-21.pdf |newspaper=BizEd |date=November–December 2002 |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206065944/http://aacsb.edu/publications/bized/p16-21.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote ''The Dilbert Principle'' around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren't in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adams explained the principle in a 1995 ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Scott. "Manager's journal: The Dilbert principle." ''Wall Street Journal''  [New York, N.Y.] 22  May 1995, Eastern edition: A12. ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book ''The Dilbert Principle'', which is required or recommended reading at some management and [[Master of Business Administration|business programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mot.berkeley.edu/Berkeley_Students/Students/Courses/Course_Descriptions/proj_mgmt_syll.pdf |title=Project Management Case Studies |work=Haas School of Business |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date=2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313051719/http://mot.berkeley.edu/Berkeley_Students/Students/Courses/Course_Descriptions/proj_mgmt_syll.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2012  |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hendrixs/classes/readings.html |title=Readings for CSCI 3308 - Software Engineering Methods and Tools |publisher=University of Colorado Boulder |date=March 16, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922194230/http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hendrixs/classes/readings.html |archivedate=September 22, 2006 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |title=Syllabus - SW Project Mgt - CSE5315 - 1998 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220024018/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |title=EM 501 Management of Organizations |publisher=Washington State University |date=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209050420/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha-squirrel to lead them. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 43 weeks.

Adams' presentation of the principle is [[satire|satirical]]—facetious but also addressing a real-world concern.

==Comparative principles==
The Dilbert principle is comparable to the [[Peter principle]]. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, ''The Peter Principle'', [[Laurence J. Peter]] explains "percussive sublimation", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e., promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees.

The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to "higher" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously held, so placing them in a supervisory position is a way to quietly remove them from the workforce without actually firing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as [[Putt's Law]].

In [[economics]], the '''economic region of production''' is an offshoot of the theory of [[production function]] with two variables. It is a cost-oriented theory which defines the region in which the optimal factor combination will lie.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;H.L. Ahuja, Advanced Economic Theory, Microeconomic Analysis, S.Chand (2007) {{ISBN|81-219-0260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a map of the region of optimal production.

==Basic theory==
Production lines Q1 and Q2  are the [[isoquant]]s, depicting the technically efficient factor combinations at different levels of production. The ridge lines A and B demarcate the technically efficient region of production. Above the line OA and below the line OB slope of the isoquants is positive which means that increases in both capital and labour are required to produce a given fixed quantity of output. The ridge lines are the combination of points where [[marginal product]] (MP&lt;sub&gt;LK&lt;/sub&gt;) of one of the factors is zero.

The theory entails that there is a limit to how much one factor can be substituted for another. When production reaches a point where substitution between the factors becomes impossible (MP&lt;sub&gt;LK&lt;/sub&gt;), the isoquant becomes positively sloping. No rational entrepreneur will operate at a point outside the ridge lines (Region of Economic Nonsense).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Ernst Abraham Dahlström''' (26 March 1846 – 16 January 1924) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[businessman]] and [[philanthropist]].

Dahlström inherited his father's position as manager of trading house C.M. Dahlström. His younger brother [[Magnus Dahlström]] joined in soon after. The brothers made significant donations to their home town [[Turku]].

Dahlström worked as manager of Kymi Papermill in 1873–1904 and board member of the subsequent [[Kymmene Corporation|Kymin Oy]]. He developed the Finnish [[insurance]] sector and [[Finnish maritime cluster|shipbuilding]]. Dahlström also had a significant role in development of Turku shipbuilding industry.

== Career ==
Dahlström studied in Behm German school in [[Viipuri]] and did his internship in [[Hackman|Hackman &amp; Co.]] in the same city. He returned in Turku in 1869 to work as bookkeeper in his father's company, [[trading house]] C.M. Dahlström. He got [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] rights in the following year.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

In 1872 Dahlström took leadership of the trading house, after his father fell ill. The trading house had investments in [[industry]] and [[shipping]], and under young Dahlström's leadership the trading house invested increasingly on industrial companies. His younger brother Magnus became a co-manager in 1881, after finishing his studies in [[Stuttgart]]. The brothers worked closely to each other and it is difficult to distinguish the originator of each project. Also their spouses were siblings: Ernst was married to 1853-born Rosina Sofia Julin in 1875;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt; Magnus Dahlström married her younger sister Ellen Maria Julin. The father of the Julin sisters was consul [[John Julin]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;

In 1873 just 27-year-old Ernst Dahlström became the first manager of Kymi Papermill. Kymi papermill was the most important investment of the trading house. After the company merged with Voikkaa and Kuusankoski papermills in 1904, creating [[Kymmene Corporation|Kymin Oy]], the trading house remained a major owner in the company and Dahlström continued as board member. The head office remained in Turku and a part of the time Dahlström worked at factory located in [[Kuusankoski]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

Dahlström held management positions also in number of other companies, such as [[Akaa]] and [[Vartsala]] steam [[sawmills]], [[Aura, Finland|Aura]] [[sugar factory]], and Turku engineering and shipbuilding companies Åbo Mekaniska Verkstads, the subsequent [[Vulcan (Turku shipyard)|Ab Vulcan]] and also [[Wm. Crichton &amp; Co.|W:m Crichton &amp; C:o]]. He was a founding member of Åbo Aktiebank in 1896 and member of [[Bank of Finland]] discount committee. In 1905 the brothers founded steam shipping company Transito Ab which focused on [[timber]] and [[coal]] transportation. It was the first major cargo steam shipping company in Turku.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

The Dahlström brothers participated in founding insurance companies Fennia and Verdandi in 1905 and two years later in [[Sampo Group|Sampo]]. They worked in those for a short time in management positions.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Dahlström was member of the [[Diet of Finland|diet]] in 1885, 1888, 1891, 1897, 1899 and 1904–1905. He was [[city council]]lor in Turku in 1875–1894.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
[[File:Turku Art Museum.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Turku Art Museum]].]]
The brothers were theatre and art patrons and in the 1890s they started donating significant sums to their home city, Turku. In 1895 the brothers donated 150&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;[[Finnish markka|marks]] for art museum building. The [[granite]]-made [[Turku Art Museum]] planned by [[Gustaf Nyström]] was built on [[Puolalanmäki]] and inaugurated in April 1904. In 1912 the brothers saved the Swedish-speaking theatre from financial trouble; the theatre was renamed [[Åbo Svenska Teater]] in 1919. Donations by Dahlström brothers had an important role in 1919 at founding [[Åbo Akademi]], the Swedish speaking university of Turku.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

While the art museum and university were the most significant donations, the brothers also supported individual students and public health work. Their actions also inspired other donors.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

== Family ==
Ernst and Rosina Dahlström had two sons and daughter: Carl-Johan Dahlström (1876–1935), Greta Dahlström (1877–1902) and Erik Abraham Dahlström (1879–1943).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst ja Magnus Dahlström"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Ernst Dahlström"/&gt;

A '''Special Protocol Assessment''' ('''SPA''') is an advanced declaration from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] that an uncompleted Phase III [[clinical trial|trial]]'s design, clinical endpoints, and [[statistics|statistical analyses]] are acceptable for FDA approval.  The purpose of a SPA is to allow a company to run or initiate a clinical trial of an experimental drug without fear that the FDA will object to the trial design itself, in the event that the company subsequently applies for product approval.

Three types of protocols related to [[PDUFA]] products are eligible for this special protocol assessment under the PDUFA goals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080571.pdf FDA Guidance for SPA - May 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
# animal carcinogenicity protocols, 
# final product stability protocols, 
# clinical protocols for [[phase III trial|phase 3 trial]]s whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim if the trials had been the subject of discussion at an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting with the [[FDA review division|review division]], or in some cases, if the division agrees to such a review because the division is aware of the developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed and the questions are being answered.

The clinical protocols for phase 3 trials can relate to efficacy claims that will be part of an original [[new drug application]] (NDA) or [[Biologic License Application]] (BLA) or that will be part of an efficacy supplement to an approved NDA or BLA.

'''Groupe Barrière''' operates casinos in France, [[Switzerland]] and elsewhere in Europe. The group also operates in the French [[Luxury resort|luxury]] hotel industry and in the catering and [[leisure]] industries.

==History==
[[File:Normandy Barrière Deauville.JPG|thumb|250px|5 Stars Normandy Hotel, [[Deauville]]]]

===François André, founder===
*'''1912-1951''': re-inventing the [[Deauville]] and [[La Baule]] seaside resorts

As a young man from [[Ardèche]] who came up to [[Paris]] in the early 20th century, François André started a casino business by acquiring the Ostend casino in Belgium, while Eugène Cornuché, his partner, began building the '''Hôtel Normandy''' and having the [[Deauville]] casino rebuilt in 1912. In 1918, François André set up the Haussmann gaming circle in [[Paris]] and continued to grow his business by designing the [[La Baule]] resort based on the Deauville model and by purchasing the '''Hôtel Royal''' and casino in 1923. He invented the modern day resort concept by combining casinos, luxury hotels and sports facilities all on one site.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1926, François André took on the construction of the '''Hôtel Hermitage''' at [[La Baule]].

1927, he took over from Eugène Cornuché as managing director of SHCD (Société des Hôtels et Casino de Deauville). He then had the Hôtel du Golf in Deauville built.

===[[Lucien Barrière]]===
*'''1951-1987''' - Groupe Lucien Barrière’s founding and development throughout France

In 1951, Lucien Barrière, François André’s nephew, joined the group.

In 1957 Lucien Barrière was appointed to the Board of several of the group’s entities and became his uncle’s sole legal heir in 1961. He undertook a project to modernise and develop the group by buying new establishments in [[Trouville-sur-Mer|Trouville]], [[Dinard]], [[St-Malo]], [[Royan]] and [[Enghien-les-Bains]].

In 1980, SHCLB (Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière) was founded to cover the [[La Baule]] hotels and casinos.

In 1987, Lucien Barrière participated in the arrival of slot machines in France.

===Diane Barrière-Desseigne===
*'''1990-2000''':

In the early 1990s, [[Accor]] became a major SHCLB shareholder.

In 1990, Diane Barrière-Desseigne succeeded her father, Lucien Barrière, and launched major renovation projects. On top of their prestige, the hotels are closely connected to the film industry and the Arts. The elite figures of the film industry visit the [[Normandy Barrière]] and the Royal Barrière during the [[American Film Festival]] in Deauville.

In 1995, Diane Barrière-Desseigne suffered a very serious plane accident and from 1997, her husband Dominique Desseigne co-managed the SHCD and SHCLB at her side.

In 1998, SHCD bought [[Fouquet's]] restaurant and brand.

Diane Barrière-Desseigne died in 2001. Dominique Desseigne took over group management and became chairman of SFCMC.

===Dominique Desseigne===
*'''Since 2001''': Under the chairmanship of Dominique Desseigne, the SHCD and the SHCLB took on a new dimension with the first international developments.

In 2003, SHCLB opened the Casino Barrière de [[Montreux]] in [[Switzerland]], which became the leading casino in Switzerland in 2008 in terms of total gross gaming takings.&lt;ref&gt;*Source: Commission Fédérale des Maisons de Jeux en Suisse (Swiss Casino Federal Gaming Commission)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, SHCD took over the Ryads Resort Development, owner of the land on which the Hôtel Naoura Barrière in [[Marrakech]] (Morocco) was later built, supported by top ranking investors who purchased an equity stake in Ryads Resort Development.

In 2004, the Desseigne-Barrière family, [[Accor]] and [[Colony Capital|Colony Capital investment funds]] decided to team up as Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière, subsequently renamed Groupe Lucien Barrière, which combined the businesses of SHCD, SHCLB and Accor Casinos to create a prestigious casino and hotel group.

Since 2005, the expansion has continued with the opening of [[casino]]s in [[Toulouse]], [[Cairo]], [[Leucate]], [[Blotzheim]] and [[Lille]], the opening of the Naoura Barrière in [[Marrakech]] (Morocco), Hôtel Fouquet’s Barrière in [[Paris]] and the Spark (fitness centre for treatments, sport and Spa) in [[Enghien-les-Bains]]. The Hôtel Barrière [[Lille]] will open during autumn 2010 and the hotel complex and balneo-therapy centre adjoining the Casino Barrière de [[Ribeauvillé]] is forecast to open late 2011.

During the same period, the public service concessions of the Barrière Casinos in [[La Baule]], [[Dinard]], [[Deauville]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Nice]], [[Cassis]] and [[Saint-Raphaël, Var|Saint Raphaël]] were renewed, which reveals the confidence these towns place in the group.

On 15 April 2009, [[Colony Capital]] sold its Groupe Lucien Barrière shares to [[Accor]], which now holds a 49% equity stake in the company.

In 2010, Groupe Lucien Barrière and [[Française des Jeux (lottery)|Française des Jeux]] designed an on-line gaming platform with 3D online gaming, which is called LB Poker company.&lt;ref name="gz-news"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://gamingzion.com/gamblingnews/european-commission-finally-happy-with-french-gambling-laws-1768|title= European Commission Approve French Gambling Laws|last=Michael Franceze|date= 25 November 2010|work=GamingZion|publisher=2iVentures|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intercontinental Bank plc''', commonly referred to as '''Intercontinental Bank''' or simply '''Intercontinental''', is a [[commercial bank]] in [[Nigeria]]. It is now owned by [[Access Bank plc]].  Intercontinental Bank is one of the twenty-four commercial banks licensed by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]], the country's banking regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenbank.org/Supervision/finstitutions.asp|title=Central Bank of Nigeria:: All Financial Institutions|website=www.cenbank.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Intercontinental Bank was a large financial services provider in [[West Africa]]. {{asof|2008|December|post=,}} the bank's shareholder's equity was valued at approximately US$1.7 billion (NGN:261 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200907130119.html|title=Nigeria: 12 Nigerian Banks Make World's Top 1,000|last=Gabriel|first=Omoh|date=2009-07-13|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shares of [[stock]] of Intercontinental Bank are listed on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]] (NSE), where they trade under the symbol: INTERCONT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/finance?hl=en&amp;q=intercontinental+bank&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=we|title=intercontinental bank - Google Finance Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bank was established in 1989 under the name '''Nigerian Intercontinental Merchant Bank Limited'''. That same year, the first subsidiary, Intercontinental Securities Limited, was established. In 1996, the bank acquired controlling shareholding in Equity Bank of Nigeria, a commercial bank. Also is 1996, Intercontinental acquired majority shareholding in West African Provincial Company plc (WAPIC), an insurance company. Intercontinental converted into a commercial bank in 1999. In 2002, the company listed its shares on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]].
In 2005, Intercontinental successfully merged with three other commercial banks, in which it held equity positions prior to the merger, namely Equity Bank of Nigeria, Gateway Bank and Global Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intercontinentalbankplc.com/portal/general/aboutus.php?pid=36&amp;mode=content|title=intercontinentalbankplc.com|website=intercontinentalbankplc.com|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a special audit of the commercial banks in [[Nigeria]] by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]], the country's banking regulator, found nine of the banks to be under-capitalized and badly managed. Intercontinental Bank Plc. was one of the troubled banks. Following the injection of capital by the [[Government of Nigeria|Federal Government of Nigeria]], to maintain solvency, the troubled banks have embarked on re-capitalization through participation by new investors, yet to be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102070665.html|title=Nigeria: Banks' Boards Meet Over New Investors|last=Ekundayo|first=Kayode|date=2011-02-07|work=Daily Trust (Abuja)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102141302.html|title=Nigeria: Shareholders Optimistic of Better Days for Rescued Banks|last=Akanbi|first=Festus|date=2011-02-14|work=This Day (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Access Bank began talks with the Central Bank of Nigeria to acquire Intercontinental Bank. Further to the approval of the shareholders of Intercontinental bank and Access Bank, court sanction of the Federal High Court of Nigeria and approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, Access Bank plc completed recapitalization of Intercontinental Bank and the acquisition of 75% majority interest in Intercontinental Bank. In effect, Intercontinental Bank (including all its assets, liabilities and undertakings) became a subsidiary of Access Bank plc.

'''John Napier Wyndham Turner''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|CC|QC}} (born June 7, 1929) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] lawyer and politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|17th Prime Minister of Canada]], in office from June 30 to September 17, 1984.

In his political career, Turner held several prominent [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] posts, including minister of justice and minister of finance, under Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] from 1968 to 1975. Amid a global recession and the prospect of having to implement the unpopular wage and price controls, Turner surprisingly resigned his position in 1975. After a hiatus from politics from 1975 to 1984, Turner returned and successfully contested the Liberal leadership. Turner held the office of prime minister for 79 days (the second shortest tenure in Canadian history after Sir [[Charles Tupper]]), as he advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to dissolve parliament immediately after being sworn in as prime minister, and went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide. Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and headed the Official Opposition for the next six years, leading his party to a modest recovery in the 1988 campaign; he resigned as Liberal leader in 1990 and stepped down as an MP at the 1993 election. Turner was Canada's first prime minister born in the [[United Kingdom]] since [[Mackenzie Bowell]] in 1896. At age {{age|1929|6|7}}, Turner is currently the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by longevity|oldest living former Canadian Prime Minister]].

==Early life==
Turner was born on June 7, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=n2diDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=John+Turner+1929&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKkprq853UAhWEiywKHcBMDQIQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Turner%201929&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Richmond, London]], England, to Leonard Hugh Turner, a journalist,&lt;ref name="nyt1984"/&gt; and [[Phyllis Ross|Phyllis Gregory]]. He had a brother, Michael (who died shortly after birth), born in 1930, and a sister, Brenda.&lt;ref name="cbcarchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/the-long-run-the-political-rise-of-john-turner/destiny-and-determination-to-lead.html |title=John Turner: Destiny and determination to lead |publisher=CBC |accessdate=October 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Turner's father died in 1932, he and his sister moved to Canada with their Canadian-born mother. The family settled in her childhood home in [[Rossland, British Columbia]] and later moved to [[Ottawa, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="nyt1984"/&gt;

Turner's mother was loving but demanding of her two children.&lt;ref name="cbcarchives"/&gt; The family was not wealthy.&lt;ref name="nyt1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbcarchives"/&gt; His mother remarried in 1945 to [[Frank Mackenzie Ross]], who later served as [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]], and the family relocated to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].

===Education===
Turner was educated at [[Ashbury College]] and St Patrick's College, Ottawa (senior matriculation). He enrolled at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1945 at age 16, and was among Canada's outstanding track sprinters in the late 1940s, qualifying for the 1948 Olympic team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubcsportshalloffame.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?person_id=78&amp;searchall=1 |title=John Turner |work=UBC Sports Hall of Fame |publisher=University of British Columbia |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211174444/http://www.ubcsportshalloffame.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?person_id=78&amp;searchall=1 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail0401.cfm?id=2448|title=Former Prime Minister John Turner to be inducted into UBC Sports Hall of Fame|date=March 25, 2004|publisher=Canadian Interuniversity Sport|accessdate=October 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211090500/http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail0401.cfm?id=2448|archivedate=December 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1101764&amp;auth=OSPREY WRITERSGROUP|title=They still gather to honour John Turner|year=2008|publisher=The Daily Observer|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the Canadian record for the 100 metres, but a bad knee kept him from competing in the 1948 London Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/true-grit/article4284591/?page=all |title=True Grit |first=John |last=Allemang |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from UBC with a B.A. Honours in 1949.

Awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]], Turner went on to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he earned a B.A., Jurisprudence, 1951; a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], 1952; and an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]], 1957. He was on the track and field team at Oxford; one of his teammates was [[Roger Bannister]], who became the first runner to break the four-minute barrier in the mile.&lt;ref&gt;''True Grit'', by John Allemang, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, Turner was a classmate and friend of future Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]]. He also pursued doctoral studies at the [[University of Paris]] from 1952 to 1953. While attending UBC, he became a member of the fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]].

===Relationship with Princess Margaret===
On May 19, 1959, at a party hosted by his stepfather, as Lieutenant Governor, to celebrate the opening of the new British Columbia [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]], Turner spent a considerable amount of time dancing with [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], one year his junior. This was the first time that Turner received significant press attention in Canada; there was considerable speculation about whether the two would become a serious couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/the-long-run-the-political-rise-of-john-turner/destiny-and-determination-to-lead.html|title=Destiny and determination to lead|date=June 16, 1984|publisher=[[CBC Television]]|accessdate=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StarDelacourt&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1193874--when-the-queen-is-your-boss| last=Delacourt| first=Susan| title=When the Queen is your boss| date=May 25, 2012| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to letters by Princess Margaret obtained by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the relationship was more serious than previously thought with the princess writing in one letter, seven years later, that she "nearly married him".&lt;ref name=postmarg/&gt; According to contemporary press reports, the relationship caused serious consternation at [[Buckingham Palace]] as Turner is a Roman Catholic, and Margaret would have had to forfeit her place in the line of succession to the throne in order to marry him.&lt;ref name=postmarg&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess Margaret 'nearly married' John Turner before he became Canada's prime minister, letters reveal|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2015/02/22/princess-margaret-nearly-married-john-turner-before-he-became-canadas-prime-minister-letters-reveal/|accessdate=February 23, 2015|work=National Post|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
Turner was married on May 11, 1963, to [[Geills Turner|Geills McCrae Kilgour]] (b. 1937) who was a grand-niece of Canadian Army doctor [[John McCrae]], the author of what is probably the best-known First World War poem, "[[In Flanders Fields]]", and sister of [[David Kilgour]], a long-time Canadian [[Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=nyt1984&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/man-in-the-news-new-leader-for-canada-john-napier-turner.html |title=MAN IN THE NEWS; NEW LEADER FOR CANADA: JOHN NAPIER TURNER |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=June 18, 1984 |first=Douglas |last=Martin |accessdate=October 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turners have a daughter named Elizabeth and three sons: David, Michael, and Andrew.

The Turner children attended [[Rockcliffe Park Public School]], in [[Ottawa, Ontario]]. All three sons attended [[Upper Canada College]], in [[Toronto, Ontario]].

==Early career==
Turner practised law, initially with the firm of [[Stikeman Elliott]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, and was elected as a Member of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] in 1962.

In 1965, while vacationing in [[Barbados]], Turner noticed that former prime minister and [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[John Diefenbaker]], staying at the same hotel, was struggling in the strong [[ocean surface wave|surf]] and [[undertow (wave action)|undertow]] and Turner, being a competitive swimmer during university days, jumped in and pulled Diefenbaker to shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/primeministers/h4-3432-e.html|title=A future prime minister rescues a former prime minister|date=January 29, 2002|work=First Among Equals|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet Minister==

===Prime ministership of Lester Pearson===
Turner was seen as "The Golden Boy" of the Liberal Party from the time he entered parliament. An outstanding scholar and athlete, Turner was a successful lawyer, was fluently bilingual, was considered physically attractive by his contemporaries, and had developed political networks across the country.

Turner was also generally respected for his work as a cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s, under prime ministers [[Lester Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Colleague [[Walter L. Gordon|Walter Gordon]] wrote that Turner was exceptionally loyal and respectful when dealing with senior ministers in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''A Political Memoir'', by [[Walter L. Gordon|Walter Gordon]], Toronto 1977, [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]] publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson|Lester Pearson]] in various capacities, most notably as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. When Pearson retired, Turner ran to succeed him at the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|1968 leadership convention]]. Turner, at age 38 the youngest of the dozen leadership candidates, stated "My time is now",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/the-long-run-the-political-rise-of-john-turner/my-time-is-now.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=The Long Run: The Political Rise of John Turner – CBC Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked during his speech that he was "not here for some vague, future convention in say, [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1984|1984]]". Turner stayed on until the fourth and final ballot, finishing third behind [[Pierre Trudeau]] and runner-up [[Robert Winters]].

===Prime ministership of Pierre Trudeau===
Turner served in Trudeau's cabinet as [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] for four years. Litt argues that Turner was a hard-working, well-informed minister whose success was assured by his warm relationship with his peers.  His achievements, say Litt, included strengthening the rights of individual defendants on trial, greater efficiency in the justice system, creation of the influential [[Law Commission of Canada|Law Reform Commission]], selecting highly professional judges, and bringing a policy perspective to the Justice Department. He led the government's position in the highly controversial [[ Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], and he took control during the [[October Crisis]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Litt|title=Elusive Destiny:The Political Vocation of John Napier Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mMdjxPPLdBsC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner then served as [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] from 1972 until 1975. His challenges were severe in the face of global financial issues such as the [[1973 oil crisis]], the collapse of the postwar [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods trading system]], slowing economic growth combined with soaring inflation ([[stagflation]]), and growing deficits. His positions were more conservative than Trudeau's and they drew apart. In 1975 Turner surprisingly resigned from cabinet, reportedly due to personality conflicts with Trudeau. The Liberals had won the [[Canadian federal election, 1974|1974 election]] by attacking [[Robert Stanfield]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] over their platform involving wage and price controls. However, Trudeau decided to implement the wage and price controls in late 1975, so some have suggested that Turner quit rather than carry out that proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Litt, ''Elusive Destiny,'' p 190&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview with [[Catherine Clark]] on [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]] Turner confirmed his resignation from cabinet was a direct result of refusing to implement wage and price controls, after campaigning against them in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6suF6U71yEQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear left}}

In his memoirs, Trudeau wrote that Turner said he resigned as Finance Minister in 1975 because he was tired of politics, after 13 years in Ottawa, and wanted to move on to a better-paying job as a lawyer in Toronto, to better support his family and to be with them more, as his children were growing up.  Trudeau also suggested that Turner's years as finance minister were very difficult because of turbulent and unusual conditions in the world economy, characterized as stagflation, largely caused by enormous increases in the price of oil.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Elliott Trudeau, ''Memoirs'', (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bay Street==
From 1975 to 1984, Turner worked as a corporate lawyer at [[Bay Street]] law firm [[McMillan Binch Mendelsohn LLP|McMillan Binch]]. When Pierre Trudeau resigned as Liberal leader in 1979 following an [[Canadian federal election, 1979|election loss]], Turner announced that he would not be a candidate for the Liberal leadership. Trudeau was talked into rescinding his resignation after the government of [[Joe Clark]] was defeated by a [[motion of no confidence]], and returned to contest and win the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]]. Trudeau would serve as Prime Minister until 1984.

==Prime minister (June–September 1984)==
Trudeau retired after polls showed the Liberals faced certain defeat in the next election if he remained in office.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"&gt;''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner then re-entered politics, and defeated [[Jean Chrétien]], his successor as finance minister, on the second ballot of the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1984|June 1984 Liberal leadership convention]]. He was formally appointed prime minister on June 30. When he was sworn in, Turner was not an MP or senator. Had he wished to have parliament summoned, he would not have been able to appear on the floor of the House of Commons. He also announced that he would not run in a by-election to get into the Commons, but would instead run in the next general election as the Liberal candidate in [[Vancouver Quadra|Vancouver Quadra, British Columbia]].  This was a sharp departure from usual practice, in which the incumbent in a [[safe seat]] resigns to allow a newly elected party leader a chance to get into parliament.  However, this was part of Turner's strategy to rebuild the Liberals' image in western Canada; at the time, the party held no seats west of [[Winnipeg]].

In his final days of office, Trudeau recommended that [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]] appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions, including [[Senate of Canada|senators]], judges, and executives on various governmental and [[crown corporation]] boards. The large number of appointments, as well as doubtful qualifications of some appointees, generated a severe backlash across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"/&gt; Turner then made a further 70 appointments himself, one of Trudeau's conditions for retiring earlier than he had planned.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson, p. 320; Newman, p. 71"&gt;Donaldson, p. 320; Newman, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 election===
[[File:Turner and Trudeau at the 1984 Liberal leadership convention.png|right|thumb|Turner (center) in 1984]]
On July 9, only nine days after being sworn in, Turner asked Sauvé to dissolve parliament and advised her to [[Canadian federal election, 1984|call an election]] for early September. Turner was persuaded by internal polls that showed the Liberals were ahead of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Tories]]; after Turner won the leadership his party surged in the polls to take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points before he was selected.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"/&gt; Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney and other experts had expected Turner to tour Canada during the summer and early autumn, accompanying [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] on their upcoming visits, and then call the election for later in the autumn.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"/&gt; However, the Liberals' polling data was faulty; they had in fact not polled since May and the situation had since changed, not least because of the public uproar over the patronage appointments. As the campaign unfolded, the Tories and Mulroney, who was fighting his first general election in any capacity, soon took the lead.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson, p. 320; Newman, p. 71"/&gt;

Early in the campaign, Turner appeared rusty and old fashioned. His policies contrasted with Trudeau and seemed to legitimize the Tory calls for lowering the deficit, improving relations with the United States, cutting the bureaucracy, and promoting more federal-provincial harmony. He spoke of creating "make work programs", a discarded phrase from the 1970s that had been replaced by the less patronizing "[[job creation program]]s". Turner was also caught on television patting the bottoms of Liberal Party President [[Iona Campagnolo]] and Vice-President Lise St. Martin-Tremblay, causing an uproar among [[feminists]], who saw such behaviour as sexist and condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/the-long-run-the-political-rise-of-john-turner/a-very-tactile-politician.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=The Long Run: The Political Rise of John Turner – CBC Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the televised leaders' debate, Turner attacked Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had allegedly set up in anticipation of victory, comparing it to the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governments of Quebec.  Mulroney responded by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made on the advice of Trudeau and Turner. Turner had the right to advise Sauvé to cancel Trudeau's appointments—advice that she was bound to follow by convention—but failed to do so and added to his own. Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for what he called "these horrible appointments."  Turner claimed that "I had no option" except to let them stand. Mulroney  responded, "[[You had an option, sir]]{{spaced ndash}}to say 'no'{{spaced ndash}}and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party." He highlighted the Liberals long record in government and resulting patronage appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/federal-politics-general/mulroney-vs-turner.html Mulroney vs. Turner - Television - CBC Archives&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers believed that Mulroney clinched the election at this point, as it made Turner look weak and indecisive. Analysts agreed he was "done in by television."&lt;ref&gt;Litt, ''Elusive Destiny'' p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner discovered late in the campaign that the Liberals' electoral hopes were poor in their traditional stronghold of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;John Sawatsky, ''The Insiders: Government, Business, and the Lobbyists,'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The party had previously relied on Trudeau's appeal, patronage, and traditional dislike of the Progressive Conservatives for victory in  recent elections. Turner had surrounded himself with Trudeau's factional opponents and Trudeau himself did not endorse Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Rae Penniman|title=Canada at the Polls, 1984: A Study of the Federal General Elections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pC3wqzDBlCcC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1988|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=106–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a last-minute turnaround, Turner rehired much of Trudeau's staff during the final weeks, but this had little effect. Quebec's disaffection with the federal Liberals regarding the [[Patriation|patriation of constitution]] in 1982 further contributed to their defeat. Mulroney, a native Quebecker, was able to harness that discontent to the Progressive Conservatives' advantage by promising a new constitutional agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Sawatsky, ''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition''&lt;/ref&gt;

The last days of the campaign saw one Liberal blunder piled upon another. Turner continued to make gaffes that caused voters to see him as incompetent and a relic from the past.&lt;ref name="Secret7172"&gt;Newman, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 4, the Liberals were swept from power in a Tory landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Rae Penniman|title=Canada at the Polls, 1984: A Study of the Federal General Elections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pC3wqzDBlCcC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1988|publisher=Duke U.P|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals were cut down to 40 seats, the fewest in the party's history until [[Canadian Federal Election 2011|2011]], against 211 for the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals had fallen to 17 seats in Quebec, all but four in and around Montreal.  Eleven members of Turner's cabinet were defeated. At the time, it was the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party in the federal parliament.

Turner stepped down as prime minister on September 17. The election having been called just over a week after his being sworn in, Turner held the office of prime minister for two months and seventeen days, the second-shortest stint in Canadian history, ahead of only [[Charles Tupper|Sir Charles Tupper]], who took office after dissolution of parliament. Turner, along with Tupper and later [[Kim Campbell]], were the only PMs who never faced a parliament and never implemented any legislative initiatives.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Turner managed to defeat the Tory incumbent in Vancouver Quadra by 3,200 votes, a surprising result given the size of the Tory wave, and became [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]].  He was the only Liberal MP from British Columbia, and one of only two from west of Ontario.  The Liberals, amid their worst showing in party history and led by an unpopular Turner, were said by some pundits to be following the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberals]] into oblivion. Though the Liberals had not fared much better in the [[Canadian federal election, 1958|1958 election]], they had clearly emerged as the main opposition party back then. After the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]], however, the NDP were not far behind with 30 seats, and their leader [[Ed Broadbent]] consistently outpolled Turner and even Mulroney.

The Liberals responded by using their large [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] majority, built up over years of Liberal majorities in the Commons, to stall Mulroney's legislation. In addition, a group of young Liberal MPs, known as the "[[Liberal Party of Canada Rat Pack|Rat Pack]]", pestered Mulroney at every turn. The group included [[Sheila Copps]], [[Brian Tobin]], [[Don Boudria]] and [[John Nunziata]].

Turner's leadership was frequently questioned, and in the lead up to the 1986 Liberal convention, a vote of confidence loomed large. The popular Chrétien resigned his seat, creating a stir in caucus. The ongoing and often open unpopularity of Turner within his own party led to many [[editorial cartoonist]]s drawing him with a back stabbed full of knives. [[Keith Davey]] and other Liberals began a public campaign against Turner, coinciding with backroom struggles involving Chrétien's supporters. The public conflict is said to have influenced many Liberals to support Turner, and he ended up getting 75% of the delegate vote.

The Liberals faced more internal conflict in the next few years, but polls frequently had them in front of the Progressive Conservatives (however, with Turner last in preferred prime minister categories). The upcoming [[Canada–US Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) and [[Meech Lake Accord]] threatened to divide the party until Turner took the position of being pro-Meech Lake and against the FTA. Turner asked the Liberal Senators to hold off on passing the legislation to implement the agreement until an election was held. It was later revealed that Mulroney planned to have an election called, anyway.

===1988 federal election===
When the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|election was called in 1988]], the Liberals had some early struggles, notably during one day in Montreal where 3 different costs were given for the proposed Liberal daycare program. The campaign was also hampered by a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] report that stated there was a movement in the backroom to replace Turner with Chrétien.

Turner campaigned much more vigorously than in 1984{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, rallying support against the proposed FTA, an agreement that he said would lead to the abandonment of Canada's political sovereignty to the United States. His performance in the debate and his attacks on Mulroney and the FTA, where he accused the Progressive Conservative Prime Minister of "selling Canada out with one signature of a pen", raised his poll numbers, and soon the Liberals were hoping for a majority. This prompted the Progressive Conservatives to stop the relatively calm campaign they had been running, and go with [[Allan Gregg]]'s suggestion of "bombing the bridge" that joined anti-FTA voters and the Liberals: Turner's credibility. The ads focused on Turner's leadership struggles, and combined with over $6 million in pro-FTA ads, stopped Turner's momentum. Also not helping the Liberals was that the NDP had opposed the FTA as well (though not as vocally); this likely resulted in vote-splitting between the opposition parties. Although most Canadians voted for parties opposed to [[free trade]], the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal.

The Liberals more than doubled their representation to 83 seats, and kept their role as the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]]; the NDP had also made gains but finished a distant third with 43 seats. The Progressive Conservatives won a reduced majority government with 169 seats. Although this election confirmed the Liberals as Canada's second major party, the results were considered a disappointment for Turner, as mid-campaign polls had predicted a Liberal majority.

The election loss seemed to confirm Turner's fate; he announced he was standing down from the party leadership in May 1989, officially resigning in June 1990. Turner resigned as Official Opposition leader, while still holding the Liberal leadership, so [[Herb Gray]] became the [[parliamentary leader|caucus leader]] for the interim. Chrétien won that year's [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1990|leadership convention]] over [[Paul Martin]]. Although not officially endorsed by Turner himself, Martin was widely the favourite of Turner's supporters.

Turner continued to represent Vancouver Quadra in the House of Commons for another few years as a backbencher before retiring from politics in the 1993 election.

==After politics==
[[File:John Turner (28368044199).jpg|thumb|left|Turner speaking at Arizona State University|alt=]]
Turner returned to private practice as a lawyer at [[Miller Thomson LLP]], eventually also heading that partnership's scholarships program. Turner is also a member of the boards of directors of several large Canadian companies.

In 1994, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].

In late 2004, Turner headed the delegation of Canadian election monitors to [[Ukraine]] who helped monitor the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential runoff vote]] of December 26. The monitoring was the first mission of the new [[Canada Corps]].

Turner, along with other former prime ministers, has taken part in the reality series ''[[Canada's Next Great Prime Minister]]''. He was intending on taking part during the 2007 edition, but due to illness, had to be replaced at the last minute by [[Paul Martin]]. Turner's health had recovered sufficiently for him to participate in the 2008 edition of the show. He is the oldest living former Canadian prime minister.

The [[Centre for the Study of Democracy]] at [[Queen's University]] produced in 2008 a revised and updated 40th anniversary edition of selected Turner speeches and writings, entitled ''Politics with Purpose'', published by [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]; the book had been published originally in 1968. Turner's career was honoured by CSD in a special day-long tribute at Queen's on October 24, 2008.

Turner has voiced his support for the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allhea&amp;mapgroup=hea|title=Supporters|last=|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/awards/gold_medal/previous_winners.asp|title=Gold Medal-Award Recipients since its inception in 1972|publisher=RCGS|accessdate= 20 July 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canadian protocol, as a former prime minister, he is styled ''[[The Right Honourable]]'' for life.

Turner was ranked No. 18 out of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through [[Jean Chrétien]]) by a survey of Canadian historians in 1999. The survey was used in the book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders'' by [[J. L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]].

Turner was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] on October 19, 1994, and was invested on May 3, 1995. His citation reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;He became Canada's seventeenth Prime Minister, crowning a distinguished parliamentary career during which he held several key Cabinet portfolios. Parallel to his political life, he has been a respected member of the law profession and supporter of many charitable organizations, in particular Mount Sinai Hospital and the Community Foundation of Toronto. His passion for his country is admired by all Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&amp;TypeID=orc&amp;id=3402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobby, Jr.]], as [[Governor of Texas|governor]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|lieutenant governor]], respectively, and launched new ethics laws in the 1973 legislative session.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deaths/5801566.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and military service==
Born to James Viron Allen and the former Mary Azilea Ferguson, Allen resided his entire life in Baytown, which straddles the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers]] county lines. He attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s from 1949-1958. He graduated from [[Lee College]], a [[community college]] in Baytown, where he served as editor of the ''Lee Lantern''. Allen was inducted into the Lee College Hall of Fame and was later a member of the Lee College board of regents. He also attended the [[University of Houston]], having studied [[economics]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name=state&gt;[http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form.asp?step=1&amp;pers_id=7171 Joseph Hugh Allen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen served in the [[United States Army Security Agency]] from 1958 to 1961, with assignments in [[Japan]] and the [[Far East]]. He was named "Serviceman of the Year" in 1961 and received a [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]].&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

==Legislative service==
According to the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', Allen was known in the legislature as a jokester and a natty dresser who chose [[bow tie]]s and [[suspenders]].&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; As a legislator in 1974, Allen was automatically a delegate to the Texas Constitutional Convention, which came within three votes of adopting a new state Constitution. While he was a legislator, Allen chaired the House Committee on Administration, the Property Tax Investigating Committee, and the standing committee on State Finance of the House Ways and Means Committee.&lt;ref name=state/&gt; He left the legislature in January 1979, as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bill Clements]] was inaugurated governor, the first member of his party to hold the office in 105 years.

Allen's wife, Kitty, said that her husband maintained a passion for politics long after he left the legislature and became a [[lobbyist]]. He worked first for [[Getty Oil Company]] and then from 1984-2001 for the Northern Natural Gas Company, which became the former [[Enron]] Corporation in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1983, Democratic Governor [[Mark Wells White]] named Allen to the Interstate Oil Compact Commission; he was reappointed in 1991 by  [[Ann W. Richards]]. Allen also served on Governor Richards' New Texas Foundation and on the Texas Democratic Leadership Council.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;
 
He was a member of several [[trade association]]s, including the Texas Intrastate Pipeline Association, Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners, [[United States Oil and Gas Association|Texas Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association]], Greater Houston Partnership, [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), Center for Public Policy/University of Houston, and the United States-Mexico [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

Allen died at the age of 68 from complications related to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. His mother had died from the same ailment in the 1980s. He was also predeceased by his father and his only son, James Neal Allen.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In addition to his wife, Allen was survived by three daughters, Sydney Allen Seaman and husband, William Seaman, of [[Humble, Texas|Humble]]; Mary Katharine Allen Stukenberg and husband, William Stukenberg, of Houston; and Sara Allen Abbott and husband, Matthew Abbott of [[Arlington, Virginia]], and two grandchildren. Services were held on May 27, 2008, at Faith [[Presbyterian]] Church in Baytown, with the [[eulogy]] delivered by former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Robert Gammage]], who had also been one of Allen's "Dirty Thirty" colleagues. Interment was on May 28 at the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in Austin.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

Allen's death came only a few weeks after the passing of former legislators [[Russell B. Cummings]], his colleague from  Houston, and [[Lena Guerrero]], who served from Austin, both of whom are also buried in the State Cemetery.

== Alzheimer's disease fund raising ==
{{Main|Blondes vs. brunettes powderpuff football}}

In response to her father's affliction, Sara Allen Abbott sought out ways to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association.  Abbott believed that too many [[charitable organizations]] were raising money through formal black tie events.  Along with her sister, she thought a powder puff football game that leveraged popular culture's [[blond#Blonde vs. brunette rivalry|blonde vs. brunette rivalry]] would be more appealing to a younger set of donors.&lt;ref&gt;The Non-Profit Times: "Blondes vs. Brunettes: Grassroots Effort Scores for Alzheimer's Association" September 15, 2010, page 7.

Baron {{nihongo|'''Kishichiro Okura'''|大倉 喜七郎|Ōkura Kishichirō|June 16, 1882 &amp;ndash; February 2, 1963}} was a Japanese entrepreneur and hotelier. 

== Biography ==
He was a son of [[Okura Kihachiro]] (1837-1928) who as an entrepreneur built up the Okura-gumi and founded the giant Okura [[Zaibatsu]] (family owned conglomerate) and the Okura [[Shogyo]] Gakko which later became [[Tokyo Keizai University]] (Tokyo University of Economics) in 1949. 

He studied at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1903 to 1906 but he did not graduate from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. 

Okura competed in the first ever car race held at [[Brooklands]] in [[Surrey]] on July 6, 1907 and came second. He is one of the pioneers who introduced the motor car to Japan. He was the President of the Imperial Hotel, and the [[Okura Hotels|Okura luxury hotel chain]] is still an important one in Japan today.

Okura Kishichiro was a primary patron in the establishment of the [[Nihon Ki-in]] or Japanese Go Association in 1924, organizing and supporting professional go players in Japan following the [[Meiji Restoration]] and subsequent ceasing of government support for the [[four go houses]].

He also invented the musical instrument [[Okraulo]], a type of vertical flute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shukokan.org/english/index.html#link04 |title=Okraulo |website=Oruka Shukokan |publisher=公益財団法人 大倉文化財団 |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate= 28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lieven Bauwens''' (14 June 1769, in [[Ghent]] – 17 March 1822, in [[Paris]]) was a [[Belgian]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[espionage|industrial spy]] who was sent to [[Great Britain]] at a young age and brought a [[spinning mule]] and skilled workers to the European continent.

He started [[textile]] plants in [[Paris]] (1799) and Ghent (1800). In Ghent he was also mayor for one year. As a leading industrial, he was visited by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1810 and awarded the [[Legion d'Honneur]].

He is remembered in [[Flanders]] for bringing the textile industry, and thereby the [[Industrial Revolution]], there.

The [[spinning mule]] that was brought to Ghent can still be visited, in the [[Museum for Industrial Archeology and Textile]] (MIAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miat.gent.be |title=In de Kijker &amp;#124; MIAT - Museum industriele archeologie en textiel |publisher=MIAT |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aviva Lawsuit ==

=== Background ===
In the 1980s, multiple insurance companies, including Abeille Vie, created life insurance contracts with a clause called "known price arbitrage" (à cours connu) destined to their best clients, therefore, shielded from market volatility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These contracts allow the investor/subscriber to place their money in an investment at a price 8 days prior to the day of the investment.

For example, if the Asian market rose, he investor was able to instruct the insurance company to move their money into Asian investments at the price before the rise, realising an instant and certain capital gain that the insurance company must cover.

With the development of technology and the instant access to market prices, these contracts become a danger to insurance companies' assets. Virtually all insurance giants taking measure of the danger, including [[AXA]] and [[AGF (company)|AGF]] started to purchase the contracts back from their clients. But not Aviva which had purchased Abeille vie in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-02-27/arbitrage-discovered |title=Arbitrage Discovered |date=2015-02-27 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=2017-11-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201064327/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-02-27/arbitrage-discovered |archivedate=2017-12-01 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://heritage.aviva.com/our-history/companies/l/labeille-compagnies-dassurances/ |title=L'Abeille Compagnies d'Assurances - Heritage - Aviva plc |website=heritage.aviva.com |access-date=2017-11-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032710/https://heritage.aviva.com/our-history/companies/l/labeille-compagnies-dassurances/ |archivedate=2017-12-01 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead Aviva drastically decreased the list of authorized investments in the contracts allowing the certain gains and refused to execute the investment orders of clients/investors who complain opening the door to litigation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

=== George's case ===
Having subscribed life insurance contracts with known price clauses for their 3 children, George's parents instigated legal action in the French court against Aviva in 2002. In 2007, Having come of age, he became party to the litigation himself. As of 2017, he has been fighting Aviva for 10 years, 15 if the years fought by his parents are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ftalphaville-cdn.ft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/George-Family-TGI-Jugement-27-ao%C3%BBt-2014.pdf |title=Financial Times |work=Financial Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044018/https://ftalphaville-cdn.ft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/George-Family-TGI-Jugement-27-ao%C3%BBt-2014.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-01|dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, up to 50 court decisions had been rendered against Aviva France. In September 2014, the French Supreme court, the [[Court of cassation|Cour de Cassation]], ruled in favor of the George family, determining that the life insurance contracts, as drafted with the "known price" clause, are legally binding under French law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/insurance/11483258/Aviva-loses-legal-fight-to-end-time-travelling-risk-free-investments.html |title=Aviva loses legal fight to end time-travelling risk-free investments |last=Dakers |first=Marion |date=2015-03-19|access-date=2017-11-23  |issn=0307-1235 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203135358/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/insurance/11483258/Aviva-loses-legal-fight-to-end-time-travelling-risk-free-investments.html |archivedate=2017-12-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, George is still in court against Aviva, having won on the principle of the legality of the contracts, he now needs to have his prejudice recognized and valued in a second ongoing battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is reported that at least 30 other people are in litigation with Aviva, with the possibility of thousands of similar contracts existing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aviva has been repeatedly criticized for not disclosing the measure of the risks related to the "known price" contracts, ''"failing to show these potential losses on its books, it is also neglecting its duty to its shareholders and policyholders".''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Meta marketing''' is "the synthesis of all [[Management|managerial]], [[Tradition|traditional]], [[Scientific method|scientific]], social and historical foundations of [[marketing]],” a term first coined by E.J.Kelly while discussing the issue of [[ethics]] and science of marketing &lt;ref&gt;Modern Marketing- Principles &amp; Practice by Chandra Bose {{ISBN|978-81-203-3945-3}} Yr of publishing- 2010, Publisher- PHI Learning Private Limited, New Delhi, Page no. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Meta Marketing is an attempt to widen the horizons of marketing by covering [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisations]]. The best examples of Meta Marketing can be selling family planning ideas or the idea of prohibition.
 
A Meta market will bring all buyers and sellers in one place for one purpose only. Instead of giving multiple products to one customer, a Meta market brings together different customers who need not necessarily differentiate between closely related products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketing91.com/meta-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;
Meta market is thus, a place, where everything connected with a certain market can be found. Let’s say a car selling in a Meta market would be a website, that sells cars but you will also find car parts there, add-ons for cars, colours for cars, mechanic’s reviews, etc. So Meta market of a certain market is a market, where you can find everything about that market and everything about markets that are strongly connected to that market.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sayeconomy.com/what-is-meta-market/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta marketing is an approach to the study of marketing and its relationship to every aspect of life by focussing on all social, ethical, scientific and business experience in marketing, thus establishing a body of knowledge base on the integration of every facet of experience with the human personality.&lt;ref&gt;144, Marketing Worterbuch Marketing Dictionary by Wolfgang J. Koshnick, Yr-2000, Walter De Gruyter, GmbH&amp;Co., Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be two different ideologies associated with meta-marketing. One, as described above, is essentially bringing together closely related industries under one umbrella industry and the other is as follows:

Even today, marketing is seen by many a [[CEO]] as a post-manufacturing activity, simply because all the elements (packaging, branding, distribution, [[selling]], [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]]), take place usually after the basic product is made. A hangover has remained of a product centred, rather than the consumer-centred frame of mind.

Until the Seventies, industrialists spent considerably more effort and money in deciding the investment in plant and machinery rather than the intricacies of marketing. Often, investment decisions were made pre-manufacturing of the product and hence, they failed to realise that the full potential of a product being sold can be maximised for customers not just by merely design and application, but also by integrating closely related products into one industry as a whole.

Also, the growth phase of many industries acted as a contributing factor as each product, no matter of what category was selling like hot-cakes. However, today, the situation has changed vastly. It’s all about mapping the customer’s brain and competitor’s strategies.

Today, understanding and considering the environment in which the industry operates has also become increasingly important. Business policy makers have, of late, made it very evident that there is a need for a strategic intent and a single-minded focus on the industry.

Also, both corporate and marketing strategy thinkers, as well as consultants, are rediscovering the need to "reshape the industry." It can be related to what [[Joseph Schumpeter]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics discovered a long time ago namely, that the central component and the driving force behind industry evolution was [[Innovation]].

A meta-marketing thinker never replicates the [[marketing mix]] of the market leader or predecessor. Going as far away as possible from the "success secret" may be a less dangerous route to take. This version of Meta Marketing says that it is better to do something different, rather than follow what the industry is doing.

As S. Ramachander highlights, “such insight inevitably precedes creating a new competitive paradigm, including rewriting the rulebook itself and changing the rules of the game. In an increasingly competitive and transnational arena, marketing companies will have to ponder more and more about not just an offering that is different or better, but one that is an expression of a marketing insight.” &lt;ref&gt;From Marketing to Meta Marketing by S. Ramachander, Special issue with the Sunday Magazine, From the publishers of THE HINDU -TRANSITIONS: September 12, 1999,"[http://www.hindu.com/folio/fo9909/99090204.jpg]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation''' (the '''MiSK Foundation''') ({{lang-ar|مؤسسة الأمير محمد بن سلمان بن عبدالعزيز الخيرية}}) is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] foundation established by Saudi crown prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] in 2011 to develop and empower Saudi youth to become participants in the future economy. MiSK specifically focuses on four key areas: education, creative and digital media, technology, and culture and arts.  It pursues this agenda both through its own programs, and through partnerships with local and global organisations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/misk-foundation-and-bloomberg/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Created in 2011, the MiSK foundation was initiated by Mohammad bin Salman, then advisor to the Governor of Riyadh. The foundation aims to increase economic opportunities in Saudi society, where seventy percent of the population is under the age of 30, in step with the [[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] national restructuring plan.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/q-a-saudi-nonprofit-misk-paves-the-way-for-youth-90230|title=Q&amp;A: Saudi nonprofit MiSK paves the way for youth|website=Devex.com|date=8 May 2017|author=Elizabeth Dickinson|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/young-saudis-see-cushy-jobs-vanish-along-with-nations-oil-wealth.html|title=Young Saudis See Cushy Jobs Vanish Along With Nation’s Oil Wealth|website=Nytimes.com|date=16 February 2016|author=Ben Hubbard|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiSK Foundation launched the Tweeps Forum in 2013, an annual networking event connecting the Saudi youth with [[social media]] leaders, gathering speakers such as [[Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], [[Ivanka Trump]], and top executives from [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/334469-ivanka-trump-fills-in-for-her-father-at-tweeps-forum-in-saudi-arabia |title=Ivanka Trump says social media 'empowers the people'|website=Thehill.com|date=21 May 2017|author=Mallory Shelbourne|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emiratespressreleases.com/abdullah-bin-zayed-attends-4th-tweeps-forum-in-riyadh/ |title=Abdullah bin Zayed attends 4th Tweeps Forum in Riyadh|website=Emiratespressrelease.com|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the MiSK Foundation was one of the main partners of the 9th [[UNESCO]] Youth Forum in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/9th-unesco-youth-forum/partners|title=Main sponsors|website=Unesco.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the two organisations signed a Framework Agreement to collaborate on the development of youth, education, emerging technologies, culture, and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_and_misk_foundation_join_forces_for_knowledge_societi/ |title=UNESCO and MiSK Foundation join forces for knowledge societies|website=Unesco.org|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th International Forum of NGOs was held in Riyadh in May 2017 in partnership with the MiSK foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/youth-and-their-social-impact-7th-international-forum-ngos-official-partnership-unesco|title="Youth and their Social Impact" – 7th International Forum of NGOs in official partnership with UNESCO|website=Unesco.org|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiSK Global Forum started in 2016 and was initially conceived as a two-day forum, with a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustg.com/two-day-misk-global-forum-in-riyadh-showcases-ideas-of-innovation-and-global-culture-to-empower-youth/|title=Two-Day MiSK Global Forum in Riyadh Showcases Ideas of Innovation And Global Culture to Empower Youth|website=Sustg.com|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 25 to 27 November 2016, the MiSK [[Hackathon]] connected more than 100 youths from London and Riyadh by satellite in a competition broadcast over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-driven-blood-bank-donation-invention-scoops-100k-top-prize-at-inaugural-uksaudi-misk-hackathon-603272386.html|title=Data-Driven Blood Bank Donation Invention Scoops $100k Top Prize at Inaugural UK/Saudi MiSK Hackathon|website=Prnewswire.com|date=27 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Foundation launched a campaign with [[Google]] named ''We Are All Online'', an initiative to share best practices in the promotion of online safety for Saudi youth, one of the most connected nations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-youtube/young-saudis-getting-creative-on-youtube-idUSBRE9AH0GY20131118|title=Young Saudis getting creative on YouTube|website=Reuters.com|date=18 November 2013|author=Matt Smith|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the Foundation became a member of the [[MIT Media Lab]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/elite-universities-selling-themselves-mit-harvard-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman|title=Elite universities are selling themselves – and look who’s buying|website=Theguardian.com|date=30 March 2018|author1=Grif Peterson|author2=Yarden Katz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the MiSK Foundation organised a New York-based youth-oriented forum, the MiSK-UNDP Youth Forum, that drew 400 participants and raised awareness on ways that Saudi and Arab youth could further involve themselves with the issues of counter extremism and the refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/youth-take-on-global-challenges-at-saudi-un-forum-1.629112|title=Youth take on global challenges at Saudi-UN forum|website=Thenational.ae|date=16 September 2017|author=Mina Al Oraibi|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a month after the [[Killing of Jamal Khashoggi|death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]  pulled funding to the foundation. The decision ended a joint initiative between the Gates Foundation and the MiSK Foundation called the ''MiSK Grand Challenges'', which made grants to organisations around the world working to create innovative solutions to development challenges. In 2017, the Gates Foundation had committed $5 million to the MiSK Grant Challenges. “Jamal Khashoggi’s abduction and murder are extremely troubling,” said the Gates Foundation in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-with-saudi-charity-over-journalists-murder/|title=Gates Foundation cuts ties with Saudi charity over journalist’s murder|last=Roberts|first=Paul|date=2 November 2018|work=Seattle Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5147080/gates-foundation-pulls-funding-from-saudi-charity-over-khashoggi-murder/|title=Gates Foundation Pulls Funding From Saudi Charity Over Khashoggi Murder|last=Denny|first=Andrew|date=4 November 2018|work=Inquisitr|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The name of the Foundation comes from "misk" ("[[musk]]" in English). The symbolism is one of generosity and benevolence in that this ancient perfume is worn by one person, while simultaneously engulfing those around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://misk.org.sa/en/about-misk/ |title=About MiSk|website=Misk.org.sa|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation’s work is focused on [[Education in Saudi Arabia|education]], [[Culture of Saudi Arabia|culture]] and [[Media of Saudi Arabia|media]]. It provides contributions to youth development, with a spotlight on technology and the arts, in order to build a knowledge-based economy.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"/&gt; The MiSK Foundation also tackles problems related to terrorism by convening events both in Saudi Arabia and internationally, including the annual Tweeps Forum and the MiSK UNDP Youth Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uae/the-national-news/20170917/281539406128649|title=Youth has its say|website=Pressreader.com|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MiSK Art Institute ==
The MiSK Art Institute, launched in 2017, is the artistic branch of the MiSK Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/saudi-arabia-s-crown-prince-adds-art-and-culture-to-his-portfolio|title=Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince launches institute to promote art in the Middle East|website=Theartnewspaper.com|date=8 December 2017|author=Anna Somers Cocks|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the institute is to become the "leading platform for grassroots cultural production, diplomacy and exchange" in Saudi Arabia. [[Ahmed Mater]] serves as its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/culture/20171012-art-contemporain-saoudien-arabie-saoudite-surprise-unesco-ahmed-mater-incense-route|title=L’art contemporain saoudien, une bonne surprise exposée à l’Unesco|website=Rf1.fr|date=12 October 2017|author=Siegfried Forster|language=fr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, the Foundation announced the expansion of the MiSK Art Institute, including new galleries, creative spaces, meeting spaces, workshops, and educational programs. The Institute also included plans for a pavilion at the 2018 [[Venice Biennale]], a New York Arab Art Festival, an exchange program with California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/saudi-arabia-is-planning-a-massive-new-arts-center|title=Saudi Arabia Is Planning a Massive, New Arts Center|website=Bloomberg.com|author=James Tarmy|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mittelstand''''' commonly refers to [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|small and medium-sized enterprises]] in German-speaking countries, especially in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], however [[United Kingdom|Britain]] also has its own.&lt;ref name="cbi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/budget-2015-must-get-uk-mittelstand-on-front-foot/|title=Budget 2015 must get 'UK Mittelstand' on front foot - CBI|website=Cbi.org.uk|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haltoninternational.com/events/developing-britains-mittelstand/|title=Developing Britain’s Mittelstand|date=15 January 2015|website=Haltoninternational.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4c1e95fc-7980-11e4-9e81-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Mittelstand proves difficult to translate and causes a lot of confusion. The majority of definitions define the Mittelstand as a statistical category and most commonly suggest that Mittelstand firms are [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs; German, ''kleine und mittlere Unternehmen'' or ''KMU'') with annual revenues up to 50 million Euro and a maximum of 499 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ifm-bonn.org/mittelstandsdefinition/definition-kmu-des-ifm-bonn/|title = IfM Bonn|date = |accessdate = 28 December 2017|website = Ifm-bonn.org|publisher = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151124032503/http://www.ifm-bonn.org/mittelstandsdefinition/definition-kmu-des-ifm-bonn/|archive-date = 2015-11-24|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ihk-berlin.de/standortpolitik/mittelstand/Mittelstand_Definitionen/2251944|title = IHK Berlin|date = |accessdate = 28 December 2017|website = Ihk-berlin.de|publisher = |archive-url = https://archive.is/20160327145841/https://www.ihk-berlin.de/standortpolitik/mittelstand/Mittelstand_Definitionen/2251944|archive-date = 2016-03-27|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not officially defined or self-explanatory hence, in English linguistic terms SMEs are not necessarily equivalent to the Mittelstand. In fact, even larger, and often family-owned, firms claim to be part of the Mittelstand, such as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Robert Bosch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The German drive to globalise|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7dbd5844-8b8d-11e0-8c09-00144feab49a.html|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2011-05-31|access-date = 2015-11-10|issn = 0307-1766|first = Daniel|last = Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the Mittelstand's positive connotations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deutsche Standards EDITIONEN GmbH {{!}} The Best of German Mittelstand – THE WORLD MARKET LEADERS|url = http://www.deutsche-standards.de/portfolio_page/the-best-of-german-mittelstand-the-world-market-leaders/|website = Deutsche-standards.de|accessdate = 2015-11-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202142810/http://www.deutsche-standards.de/portfolio_page/the-best-of-german-mittelstand-the-world-market-leaders/|archive-date = 2017-02-02|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Mittelstand mainly applies to mid-sized firms as opposed to larger listed companies and most importantly Mittelstand companies are characterized by a common set of values and management practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |contribution-url = https://static1.squarespace.com/static/548ac75ce4b0a10ad41f38e7/t/55edaa22e4b03d3d6e78da4c/1441638946906/MITWMF_Folder_Venohr_Website.pdf |last = Venohr |first = B. |last2 = Fear |first2 = J. |last3 = Witt |first3 = A. |contribution = Best of German Mittelstand - The world market leaders |editor-last = Langenscheidt |editor-first = F. |editor-last2 = Venohr |editor-first2 = B. |title = The Best of German Mittelstand |publisher = Deutsche Standards Editionen |place = Cologne |year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Erhard]], the Economics Minister who crafted the post-war (West) Germany's [[economic miracle]] (German: [[Wirtschaftswunder]]) warned against reducing the Mittelstand to a mere quantitative definition, but instead emphasized more qualitative characteristics which embody the German Mittelstand, as it is ''"...much more of an ethos and a fundamental disposition of how one acts and behaves in society.''"&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L. 1956. ‘Mittelstandspolitik.’ In Rüstow, A.

Aktionsgemeinschaft Soziale Marktwirtschaft e.V am 17 November 1955 in Bad

Ed., Ludwigsburg.&lt;/ref&gt;

What does define the Mittelstand, is a much broader set of values and more elastic definitions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Witt,

* Family ownership or family-like corporate culture 
* Generational continuity 
* Long-term focus 
* Independence 
* Nimbleness 
* Emotional attachment 
* Investment into the workforce 
* Flexibility 
* Lean hierarchies 
* Innovativeness 
* Customer focus 
* Social responsibility 
* Strong regional ties

The latest English publication on Mittelstand firms by Prof. Bernd Venohr, Prof. Jeffrey Fear and Dr. Alessa Witt highlights that: ''"These companies are predominantly run by classic “owner-entrepreneurial families” (Unternehmerfamilien) seeking to sustain the business by instituting a core ideology of longevity, conservative long-term financing, and operating practices."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Mittelstand acts as a counterpoint to a singular focus on shareholder value and dispersed investor-orientated shareholding.

== Germany's business 'landscape' and the role of the Mittelstand ==
[[File:Mittelstand pyramide.PNG|thumb|Germany's business landscape,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; showing that over 99% of German firms are Mittelstand firms but not necessarily all are SMEs.]]
Due to the broad set of values which define the Mittelstand, Venohr, Fear &amp; Witt (2015)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; divide Germany's 'business landscape' into three distinct categories of Mittelstand firms.

# '''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Classic' SME-type Mittelstand firms,''''' which account for 99% of German firms (revenue below 50 million EUR).
# '''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Upper'-sized Mittelstand firms,''''' which account for 0.34% of German firms (revenues between 50 million EUR up to 1 billion EUR).
# '''''Large corporations,''''' which account for 0.02% of German firms (revenues over 1 billion EUR) and are more well-known companies, including the DAX 30 companies.

This pyramid shows that over 99% of German firms are Mittelstand firms but 0.34 depart from the classic [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SMEs) definition. The two categories of 'classic' and 'upper' Mittelstand firms in Germany account for 68% of Germany's exports. In comparison, Germany's larger corporations generate 32% of Germany's exports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 'upper'-sized Mittelstand firms (revenues between 50 million EUR and 1 billion EUR) form a unique and distinctive group, as they are the most export-orientated group of firms in Germany's business landscape contributing significantly to Germany's sustained export success. As such, ''Mittelstand firms clearly form'' ''the backbone of the German economy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/factbook-german-mittelstand,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf|title = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi)|date = |accessdate = 28 December 2017|website = Bmwi.de|publisher = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101355/https://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/factbook-german-mittelstand,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf|archive-date = 2016-03-04|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

The Mittelstand is not a rigid economic entity. On the contrary, Germany’s liberal economic order, which is also subject to international competition, is constantly leading to structural changes which in turn influence the composition and characteristics of the corporate landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welter|first1=F|last2=May-Strobl|first2=E|last3=Wolter|first3=H|title=Mittelstand in Transition: Eine Bestandsaufnahme|journal=IfM Bonn: Ifm Materialien|date=2014|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past several years, an increase of very small units can be observed: the so-called "solo self-employed". These are business start-ups that are not designed to grow into a small or larger business over time. Instead, such entrepreneurs will act permanently as individuals. 
New forms of cooperation ("changing networks") have also emerged in the recent past. Depending on the project requirements, teams of independent agents form, each contributing their own specific skills and competences, and thus work together efficiently. However, these entrepreneurs usually do not feel like they apply to the term "Mittelstand", as do start-ups that have not been on the market for at least three years. 
On the other hand, the affinity of small and medium-sized enterprises for one another increases with company size and age; the older and larger the companies, the more they identify themselves as small and medium-sized enterprises. However, among those companies that consider themselves to be medium-sized, according to the IfM Bonn (Institute for Management in Bonn) definition, one in seven is no longer included because they no longer fulfill the criterion of "ownership and management in one hand". 
As a result of continuing globalization and worldwide corporations, SMEs in Germany were increasingly under competitive pressure. In order to compensate for the resulting disadvantages, more and more medium-sized companies have joined forces in recent decades to form co-operative partnerships. As a single member of a group of companies, the respective family-owned company retains entrepreneurial independence, but through joint inter-company activities it can gain a market position that only large companies could otherwise offer. Today's groups are regional, national, and even international. The inter-company cooperation of the group is usually organized from a legally independent center and covers a variety of areas such as purchasing, marketing, logistics, IT solutions, financing services, consulting or training, and so on. In Germany, around 250,000 companies from around 45 different branches of trade, craft trades, and the service industry are currently grouped together, resulting in around 400 groups. 320 of these groups were formed through the Central Federation of Industrial Associations e.V. (Zentralverband Gewerblicher Verbundgruppen or ZGV) based in Berlin, Brussels, and Cologne.
 
The importance of small and medium-sized enterprises is also evident from the fact that more than 160,000 small and medium-sized enterprises with about 4.3 million employees have organized themselves in the Federal Association of SMEs (BVMW). The focus of the association's work is the formation of networks, the organization of events, and political advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaschny|first1=Martin|last2=Nolden|first2=Matthias|last3=Schreuder|first3=Siegfried|title=Innovationsmanagement im Mittelstand: Strategien, Implementierung, Praxisbeispiele|journal=Gabler, Wiesbaden|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the term 'Mittelstand'==
The German word ''Stand'' refers to an [[estates of the realm|estate]], from the medieval model of society, under which a person's position was defined by birth or occupation. There were three principal levels, the upper one being the aristocracy, the middle one (the ''Mittelstand'') the free [[bourgeoisie]] of the cities, and the lower one the peasants. Today, the term is used with two meanings. The first refers to [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SME; German, ''kleine und mittlere Unternehmen'' or ''KMU''), as defined by number of employees and turnover. The second meaning refers to any family-run or -owned business (not necessarily a SME).(Note that the correct term to describe households of middling ''income'' would be ''Mittelschicht'', with the English translation [[middle class]].)

As ''Stand'' or estate addresses a group, single ''Mittelstand''-companies are often called '''Mittelständler'''.

== Geographical distribution ==
According to an article published in the journal, Die Deutsche Wirtschaft (The German Economy), the most important medium-sized enterprises—using absolute figures—are in North Rhine Westphalia at over 22%, followed by Bavaria (21%), and Baden-Württemberg (17%). The lowest ranking performers are Bremen, Saarland, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, each with an approximate share of 1%.
However, when assessed based on size by population, the city states of Hamburg and Bremen lead with 185 and 182 large medium-sized enterprises per 1 million inhabitants, respectively. The larger states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg follow close behind with 163 and 159 major medium-sized enterprises, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://die-deutsche-wirtschaft.de/ranking-der-bundeslaender-nach-top-mittelstaendlern/|title=Ranking der Bundesländer nach Top-Mittelständlern - Die Deutsche Wirtschaft|date=5 February 2017|website=Die-deutsche-wirtschaft.de|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The article also mentions the cities of Hamburg (329 enterprises), Berlin (227) and Munich (188) with the highest so-called "top middle class enterprises" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://die-deutsche-wirtschaft.de/wo-sich-der-mittelstand-am-wohlsten-fuehlt/|title=Städteranking: Wo sich der Mittelstand am wohlsten fühlt - Die Deutsche Wirtschaft|date=10 December 2017|website=Die-deutsche-wirtschaft.de|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mittelstand explained==

Many ''Mittelstand'' companies are export-oriented. They focus on innovative and high-value manufactured products, and occupy worldwide niche market leadership positions in numerous [[Business-to-business|B2B]] segments.&lt;ref name=VB10&gt;{{cite web |author=Venohr, Bernd |title=The power of uncommon common sense management principles - The secret recipe of German Mittelstand companies - Lessons for large and small companies |url=http://www.druckersociety.at/repository/2010/day01/15'30-17'00/Venohr_101118_PPT_Beamerversion.pdf|website=Druckersociety.at |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically privately owned and often based in small, rural communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the successful ''Mittelstand'' companies combine a cautious and long-term-oriented approach to business with the adoption of modern management practices, such as employing outside professional management, and the implementation of lean manufacturing practices and [[total quality management]].&lt;ref name=VB10/&gt; The ''Mittelstand'' emphasis on long-term profitability stands in contrast to the public corporations of many countries (including German public corporations) which face quarterly or annual pressure to meet expectations.

== Management model "Made in Germany" ==
The Mittelstand model is most specifically defined in the 2015 publication '''''"The Best of German Mittelstand"''''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which summarizes the distinct management model that ''"dovetails strategy, leadership and governance principles, with core processes in a unique blend, creating a finely tuned process."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Strategy: Global niche dominance
# Governance: 'Enlightened' family capitalism
# World class performance in core processes
# Locational advantages: The German microeconomic business environment

== Financial success of the Mittelstand ==
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are financially well-positioned. According to studies by IfM Bonn and the [[University of Siegen]] in 2016, their equity ratio has been rising steadily for years. At the same time, SME liabilities to banks are falling in relation to their total assets. For the first time, small and medium-sized enterprises as a whole have a higher equity ratio than large companies. Only micro-enterprises continue to have lower capitalization despite high growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pahnke|first1=A|last2=Schröder|first2=C|last3=Leonhardt|first3=F|last4=Wiedemann|first4=A|title=Finanzierungsstrukturen und -strategien kleiner und mittlerer Unternehmen: Eine Bestandsaufnahme|date=2015|publisher=IfM Bonn: IfM Materialien|location=Bonn|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One reason for this development lies in the stricter requirements under Basel II or III. To prevent their debt conditions from deteriorating, many small and medium-sized enterprises—as well as the larger family businesses—have increased their equity capital through retained earnings. This was also positively supported by the reduction in corporate taxes. At the same time, many small and medium-sized enterprises are reducing supplier credits and short-term bank liabilities.
Although SMEs continue to prefer bank loans, despite alternative means of financing, the importance of equity financing is likely to increase. For example, almost all companies will have to face increasing digitization with additional investment in information technologies to maintain their future competitiveness. However, to protect bank loans, IT technologies are not well suited due to the company-specific solutions and the generally high loss of value.

==Britain's Mittelstand==
The Mittelstand in Britain, sometimes called the ''Brittelstand''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bbbf9e8-1f35-11e5-ab0f-6bb9974f25d0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''UK Mittelstand''&lt;ref name="cbi.org.uk"/&gt; (''McMittelstand'' in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/alessa-witt-the-best-kept-secrets-in-scottish-business-1-4041177|title=Alessa Witt: The best-kept secrets in Scottish business|website=Scotsman.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plays as important a role to the UK economy as they do in Germany. Figures from the British government state that they employed 14.4 million people in the U.K. in 2013. Furthermore, the European Commission's performance review of UK this year estimated their gross value added at 473 billion euros ($595.4 billion) or 49.8 percent of the U.K. economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/04/can-the-brittelstand-rival-germany.html|title=Can the 'Brittelstand' rival Germany?|first=Holly|last=Ellyatt|date=4 November 2014|website=Cnbc.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI), has long urged for the backing of the British Mittelstand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = CBI urges backing for British ‘Mittelstand’|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4c1e95fc-7980-11e4-9e81-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ft.com%252Fcms%252Fs%252F0%252F4c1e95fc-7980-11e4-9e81-00144feabdc0.html%253Fsiteedition%253Duk&amp;_i_referer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.co.uk%252F6666cd76f96956469e7be39d750cc7d9&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2014-12-01|access-date = 2015-11-10|issn = 0307-1766|first = Barney|last = Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Help to grow schemes have been invested to help the British Mittelstand to grow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/feb/10/funding-help-to-grow-lending-business-german|title=New funding for fast-growing firms in plan for British 'Mittelstand'|first=Kitty|last=Dann|date=10 February 2015|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=28 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result it has since been growing rapidly, and in some cases has outpaced its European rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2671e242-f856-11e3-815f-00144feabdc0%27|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst continuing to grow, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottishpolicynow.co.uk/article/success-secrets-shared-learning-from-the-best-mittelstand-and-british-global-niche-champions&lt;/ref&gt; which performed a comparison between German and British successful mid-cap companies suggests that British firms are far more short-term orientated in terms of management and policy raising the question whether the UK Mittelstand can endure over time in the same manner as the German equivalent, something the British government hopes to work on by embracing a longer term place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grant-thornton.co.uk/germany |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603082021/http://www.grant-thornton.co.uk/germany |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Mittelstand's main sectors ==
Germany's ''Mittelstand'' is heavily concentrated in:
* machinery
* auto parts
* chemicals
* electrical equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany's Mittelstand Still Thrives |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/sep2010/gb20100929_905740_page_2.htm |date=September 30, 2010|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009040157/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/sep2010/gb20100929_905740_page_2.htm|archivedate=October 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrie 4.0 ==
{{Main|Industry 4.0}}
While the Mittelstand has served the German economy well since [[World War II]], it is now faced with questions about how it will adapt to the digital revolution of the 21st century. Many of the industrial machines produced by the Mittelstand are quickly being connected to the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT), from manufacturing equipment that can warn owners when material is low to cars that are connected to digital entertainment systems. Strides have recently been made by firms such as [[Trumpf]], which in October 2015 unveiled a digital platform called Axoom that can connect machines built by Trumpf and others to collect data that can be used to help firms improve their operating efficiency.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Does Deutschland do digital?|url = https://www.economist.com/news/business/21678774-europes-biggest-economy-rightly-worried-digitisation-threat-its-industrial|newspaper=The Economist|access-date = 2015-11-25|issn = 0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany’s National Academy of Science and Engineering ([[German Academy of Science and Engineering|Acatech]]) has addressed the challenge by introducing the concept of "Industrie 4.0" in 2013, calling for German manufacturing firms to enter the IT revolution by "consistently integrating information and communication technology into its traditional high-tech strategies so that it can become the leading supplier of smart manufacturing technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acatech.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Baumstruktur_nach_Website/Acatech/root/de/Material_fuer_Sonderseiten/Industrie_4.0/Final_report__Industrie_4.0_accessible.pdf|title = Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0|date = 2013|accessdate = 28 December 2017|website = Acatech.de|publisher = ACATECH|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014183202/http://www.acatech.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Baumstruktur_nach_Website/Acatech/root/de/Material_fuer_Sonderseiten/Industrie_4.0/Final_report__Industrie_4.0_accessible.pdf|archive-date = 2013-10-14|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Industrie 4.0 has been taken up by the German government and is a favorite theme of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. The government has invested 200 million euros in Industrie 4.0 research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Germany's vision for Industrie 4.0: The revolution will be digitised {{!}} ZDNet|url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/germanys-vision-for-industrie-4-0-the-revolution-will-be-digitised/|website = ZDNet|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this policy, the government seeks to create test beds for new ideas in industry and to convince the smaller Mittelstand firms to take up the cause of digitization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''MySuper''' is part of the Stronger Super&lt;ref name="stronger"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://strongersuper.treasury.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=reforms.htm |title=Stronger Super Overview of Reforms| author=Federal Government |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=1 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reforms announced in September 2011 by the [[Gillard government|Gillard Labor government]] for the [[Superannuation in Australia|Australian superannuation industry]] to replace the previous default funds system with a new default system using low cost and simple superannuation products. MySuper compliant products may be provided by [[industry superannuation fund|industry super funds]], as well as retail super funds. Funds that do not operate as default funds, such as self managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) or choice products, are not subject to MySuper standards.

Since 1 January 2014, unless an employee has chosen another investment option, employers must pay all compulsory SG contributions into approved MySuper accounts, ie., into super products that have received a MySuper authority. From that date, super funds must also credit employer contributions to a MySuper account, unless if the member has directed the trustee to do otherwise. Given that over 75% of employees stay with their employers’ default fund, it was expected that the majority of employees would be in a MySuper product from that date. Superannuation funds had until 1 July 2017 to move existing default members into a complying MySuper product. For convenience, many funds simply converted an existing default option to a MySuper account, so that members would be automatically included in a MySuper product. 

Members can opt out of the MySuper option at any time, or may chose a particular MySuper product. They must be given a minimum of 90 days' notice before a default transfer to a MySuper account is made.

The intention of the MySuper system is for market participants to create a range of easily comparable, relatively simple products, which in turn will focus competition on net costs and returns. The [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA) fosters competition by publishing fee tables and other statistics.&lt;ref name="compare"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.apra.gov.au/publications/quarterly-mysuper-statistics |title=Quarterly MySuper Statistics |first= |last= |accessdate=7 October  2018 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of a MySuper account==
The features of a MySuper product include:
* a single investment option
* a minimum level of insurance cover
* an easily comparable fee structure, with a short prescribed list of allowable fee types
* restrictions on how advice is provided and paid for, and
* rules governing fund governance and transparency.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Pages/Superannuation-reforms-2011-2013.aspx |title=Superannuation reforms 2011–2013 |author=APRA |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MySuper investments===
MySuper products are required to have a single investment option.  Many funds, such as HESTA and CBUS, have announced that they will simply use their existing default investment option as their MySuper offering – typically Balanced or Growth.&lt;ref name="hesta"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hesta.com.au/employers/mysuper.html |title=HESTA's MySuper Option | author=HESTA|accessdate=19 March 2013 |date=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 80% of not-for-profit funds will reportedly retain their existing products for MySuper.&lt;ref name="SMH MySuper"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/money/super-and-funds/mysuper-unleashes-competition-and-value-20120921-26bsk.html |title=MySuper unleashes competition and value| first=Annette| last=Sampson |accessdate=8 April 2013 |date=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables a simple transition to the MySuper regime.  However, critics of this approach argue that offering a single investment option that doesn't change over an entire working life and into retirement does not reflect customers' changing attitudes to risk as they age nor as their retirement prospects change.

====Lifecycle investment strategies====
For these reasons, the government has allowed lifecycle investment options to be the default choice for a MySuper product. Lifecycle investment options enable trustees to automatically move members into a different investment mix based on their age and other permitted factors including balance, gender, time to retirement (or combination thereof), and can be particularly relevant as part of a transition to retirement.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://strongersuper.treasury.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=publications/information_pack/mysuper.htm |title=Stronger Super| author=Treasury Department |accessdate=19 March 2013 |date=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunsuper]] was the first fund to receive approval for their lifecycle strategy.&lt;ref name="Sunsuper 2000 hours"/&gt; However, a number of lifecycle strategies have since been released from companies including Aon, Suncorp, BT and First State.

===MySuper fees===
Fees a member can be charged in MySuper products are limited to:

* administration fee
* investment fee (including a performance-based fee)
* buy and sell spreads (limited to cost recovery)
* exit fee (limited to cost recovery), and 
* switching fee (limited to cost recovery).&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;
 
In addition, trustees may charge fees for certain member‑specific costs initiated by the member or a court; for example, account splitting following a family law decision.  
 
All fees charged for MySuper products must be able to be included under these standard descriptions. This will make it simpler for members to understand what they pay and to compare fees against other MySuper products.

===MySuper insurance===
MySuper products are required to offer a standard, default level of life and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance. Members of MySuper products are able to opt-out of the insurance, or increase or decrease their insurance cover (if offered by the trustee) without having to leave the MySuper product.
 
There may be particular factors at a workplace level that influence the appropriate level and structure of insurance for employees at that workplace. Therefore, within a MySuper product, it is possible for the standard insurance cover to be replaced by a default insurance strategy tailored to meet the specific requirements of the employees of a particular employer.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;

'''Nondestructive testing''' ('''NDT''') is a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.&lt;ref name=Cartz&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartz|first=Louis|title=Nondestructive Testing|publisher= A S M International|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87170-517-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms '''nondestructive examination''' ('''NDE'''), '''nondestructive inspection''' ('''NDI'''), and '''nondestructive evaluation''' ('''NDE''') are also commonly used to describe this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Charles Hellier
|title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation
|publisher=McGraw-Hill
|year=2003
|isbn=0-07-028121-1
|pages=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are [[eddy-current testing|eddy-current]], [[magnetic-particle inspection|magnetic-particle]], [[liquid penetrant testing|liquid penetrant]], [[radiographic testing|radiographic]], [[ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic]], and [[Visual inspection|visual testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asnt.org/MinorSiteSections/AboutASNT/Intro-to-NDT.aspx|title=Introduction to Nondestructive Testing|author=|date=|website=asnt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; NDT is commonly used in [[forensic engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[systems engineering]], [[aeronautical engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name=Cartz /&gt; Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on [[medical imaging]], including on [[echocardiography]], [[medical ultrasonography]], and [[digital radiography]]. 

Various national and international [[trade association]]s exist to promote the industry, knowledge about non-destructive testing, and to develop standard methods and training. These include the [[American Society for Nondestructive Testing]], the [http://www.ndtma.org/ Non-Destructive Testing Management Association], the [http://www.icndt.org/ International Committee for Non-Destructive Testing], the [http://www.efndt.org/ European Federation for Non-Destructive Testing] and the [[British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing]]. 

NDT methods rely upon use of [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[sound]] and other signal conversions to examine a wide variety of articles (metallic and non-metallic, food-product, artifacts and antiquities, infrastructure) for integrity, composition, or condition with no alteration of the article undergoing examination.  Visual inspection (VT), the most commonly applied NDT method, is quite often enhanced by the use of magnification, borescopes, cameras, or other optical arrangements for direct or remote viewing.  The internal structure of a sample can be examined for a volumetric inspection with penetrating radiation (RT), such as [[X-rays]], [[Neutron imaging|neutrons]] or gamma radiation.  Sound waves are utilized in the case of ultrasonic testing (UT), another volumetric NDT method – the mechanical signal (sound) being reflected by conditions in the test article and evaluated for amplitude and distance from the search unit (transducer). Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either suspended in liquid or dry powder – fluorescent or colored) that are applied to a part while it is magnetized, either continually or residually.  The particles will be attracted to leakage fields of magnetism on or in the test object, and form indications (particle collection) on the object's surface, which are evaluated visually.  Contrast and probability of detection for a visual examination by the unaided eye is often enhanced by using liquids to penetrate the test article surface, allowing for visualization of flaws or other surface conditions.  This method ([[liquid penetrant testing]]) (PT) involves using dyes, [[fluorescent]] or colored (typically red), suspended in fluids and is used for non-magnetic materials, usually metals.

Analyzing and documenting a nondestructive failure mode can also be accomplished using a [[high-speed camera]] recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplished using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera.  These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture some non-destructive failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Bridges |first= Andrew |title=High Speed Cameras for Non-Destructive Testing |url=http://www.techbriefs.com/subscribe-footer-67/23-ntb/features/feature-articles38/17720-high-speed-cameras-for-non-destructive-testing?showall=1&amp;limitstart=|accessdate= 1 November 2013|publisher=NASA TechBriefs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording.  The capture images can be played back in [[slow motion]] showing precisely what happen before, during and after the nondestructive event, image by image.

==Applications==
NDT is used in a variety of settings that covers a wide range of industrial activity, with new NDT methods and applications, being continuously developed. Nondestructive testing methods are routinely applied in industries where a failure of a component would cause significant hazard or economic loss, such as in transportation, pressure vessels, building structures, piping, and hoisting equipment.

===Weld verification===
[[Image:Ressuage principe 2.svg|thumb|250px|{{ordered list |1=Section of material with a surface-breaking crack that is not visible to the naked eye. |2=Penetrant is applied to the surface. |3=Excess penetrant is removed. |4=Developer is applied, rendering the crack visible.}}]]

In manufacturing, [[welding|welds]] are commonly used to join two or more metal parts. Because these connections may encounter loads and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] during [[product lifetime]], there is a chance that they may fail if not created to proper [[specification]].  For example, the base metal must reach a certain temperature during the welding process, must cool at a specific rate, and must be welded with compatible materials or the joint may not be strong enough to hold the parts together, or cracks may form in the weld causing it to fail.  The typical welding defects (lack of fusion of the weld to the base metal, cracks or porosity inside the weld, and variations in weld density) could cause a structure to break or a pipeline to rupture.

Welds may be tested using NDT techniques such as [[industrial radiography]] or [[industrial CT scanning]] using [[X-rays]] or [[gamma rays]], [[ultrasonic testing]], [[liquid penetrant testing]], [[magnetic particle inspection]] or via [[eddy current]]. In a proper weld, these tests would indicate a lack of cracks in the radiograph, show clear passage of sound through the weld and back, or indicate a clear surface without penetrant captured in cracks.

Welding techniques may also be actively monitored with acoustic emission techniques before production to design the best set of parameters to use to properly join two materials.&lt;ref name=UltrasonicMethods &gt;{{cite book|last=Blitz|first=Jack|author2=G. Simpson |title=Ultrasonic Methods of Non-Destructive Testing|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|year=1991|isbn=978-0-412-60470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of high stress or safety critical welds, weld monitoring will be employed to confirm the specified welding parameters (arc current, arc voltage, travel speed, heat input etc.) are being adhered to those stated in the welding procedure. This verifies the weld as correct to procedure prior to nondestructive evaluation and metallurgy tests.

===Structural mechanics===
Structure can be complex systems that undergo different loads during their lifetime, e.g. [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-ion batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author = Waldmann, T.
|year = 2014
|title = A Mechanical Aging Mechanism in Lithium-Ion Batteries
|journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society
|volume = 161
|pages = A1742
|doi = 10.1149/2.1001410jes
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some complex structures, such as the [[turbo machinery]] in a [[liquid-fuel rocket]], can also cost millions of dollars. Engineers will commonly model these structures as coupled second-order systems, approximating dynamic structure components with [[spring (device)|springs]], [[mass]]es, and [[dashpot|dampers]]. The resulting sets of differential equations are then used to derive a transfer function that models the behavior of the system.

In NDT, the structure undergoes a dynamic input, such as the tap of a hammer or a controlled impulse. Key properties, such as [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[acceleration]] at different points of the structure, are measured as the corresponding output. This output is recorded and compared to the corresponding output given by the transfer function and the known input. Differences may indicate an inappropriate model (which may alert engineers to unpredicted instabilities or performance outside of tolerances), failed components, or an inadequate [[control system]].

Reference standards, which are structures that intentionally flawed in order to be compared with components intended for use in the field, are often used in NDT. Reference standards can be with many NDT techniques, such as UT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://customers.phtool.com/custom-reference-standards/edm-notch-reference-standards-gallery/|title=EDM Notch Reference Standards » PH Tool|author=|date=|website=customers.phtool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, RT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://customers.phtool.com/custom-reference-standards/radiography-rt-reference-standards/|title=Radiography (RT) Reference Standards » PH Tool|author=|date=|website=customers.phtool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VT.

===Relation to medical procedures===
[[File:Thorax pa peripheres Bronchialcarcinom li OF markiert.jpg|150px|thumb|Chest radiography indicating a peripheral [[Lung cancer|bronchial carcinoma]].]]

Several NDT methods are related to clinical procedures, such as radiography, ultrasonic testing, and visual testing.  
Technological improvements or upgrades in these NDT methods have migrated over from  medical equipment advances, including digital radiography (DR), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), and [[endoscopy]] (borescope or assisted visual inspection).

==Notable events in early academic and industrial NDT==
*1854 Hartford, [[Connecticut]] – A boiler at the Fales and Gray Car works explodes, killing 21 people and seriously injuring 50. Within a decade, the State of Connecticut passes a law requiring annual inspection (in this case visual) of boilers.
*1880–1920 – The "Oil and Whiting" method of crack detection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/Introduction/history.htm|title=History of PI|author=|date=|website=www.ndt-ed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in the railroad industry to find cracks in heavy steel parts. (A part is soaked in thinned oil, then painted with a white coating that dries to a powder. Oil seeping out from cracks turns the white powder brown, allowing the cracks to be detected.) This was the precursor to modern liquid penetrant tests.
*1895 – [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] discovers what are now known as X-rays. In his first paper he discusses the possibility of flaw detection.
*1920 – Dr. H. H. Lester begins development of industrial radiography for metals.
*1924 – Lester uses radiography to examine castings to be installed in a Boston Edison Company steam pressure power plant.
*1926 – The first electromagnetic eddy current instrument is available to measure material thicknesses.
*1927-1928 – Magnetic induction system to detect flaws in railroad track developed by Dr. Elmer Sperry and H.C. Drake.
*1929 – Magnetic particle methods and equipment pioneered (A.V. DeForest and F.B. Doane.)
*1930s – Robert F. Mehl demonstrates radiographic imaging using gamma radiation from Radium, which can examine thicker components than the low-energy [[X-ray generator|X-ray machines]] available at the time.
*1935–1940 – Liquid penetrant tests developed (Betz, Doane, and DeForest)
*1935–1940s – [[Eddy current]] instruments developed (H.C. Knerr, C. Farrow, Theo Zuschlag, and Fr. F. Foerster).
*1940–1944 – [[ultrasonic testing|Ultrasonic test]] method developed in USA by Dr. [[Floyd Firestone]], who applies for a U.S. invention patent for same on May 27, 1940 and is issued the U.S. patent as grant no. 2,280,226 on April 21, 1942. Extracts from the first two paragraphs of this seminal patent for a nondestructive testing method succinctly describe the basics of ultrasonic testing. "My invention pertains to a device for detecting the presence of inhomogeneities of density or elasticity in materials. For instance if a casting has a hole or a crack within it, my device allows the presence of the flaw to be detected and its position located, even though the flaw lies entirely within the casting and no portion of it extends out to the surface." Additionally, "The general principle of my device consists of sending high frequency vibrations into the part to be inspected, and the determination of the time intervals of arrival of the direct and reflected vibrations at one or more stations on the surface of the part." Medical [[echocardiography]] is an offshoot of this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2170493 | pmid=18172524 | volume=34 | title=The origin of echocardiography: a tribute to Inge Edler | year=2007 | journal=Tex Heart Inst J | pages=431–8 | author=Singh S, Goyal A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1946 – First neutron radiographs produced by Peters.
*1950 – The [[Schmidt hammer|Schmidt Hammer]] (also known as "Swiss Hammer") is invented. The instrument uses the world’s first patented non-destructive testing method for concrete.
*1950 – J. Kaiser introduces acoustic emission as an NDT method.
''(Basic Source for above: Hellier, 2001) Note the number of advancements made during the WWII era, a time when industrial quality control was growing in importance.''
*1963 – Frederick G. Weighart's&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 3,277,302, titled "X-Ray Apparatus Having Means for Supplying An Alternating Square Wave Voltage to the X-Ray Tube", granted to Weighart on October 4, 1964, showing its patent application date as May 10, 1963 and at lines 1-6 of its column 4, also, noting James F. McNulty’s earlier filed co-pending application for an essential component of invention&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James F. McNulty (U.S. radio engineer)]]'s&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 3,289,000, titled "Means for Separately Controlling the Filament Current and Voltage on a X-Ray Tube", granted to McNulty on November 29, 1966 and showing its patent application date as March 5, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; co-invention of [[Digital radiography]] is an offshoot of the pairs development of nondestructive test equipment at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California. See James F. McNulty also at article [[Ultrasonic testing]].
*1996 – Rolf Diederichs founded the first Open Access NDT Journal in the Internet. Today the Open Access NDT Database  NDT.net
*2008 – Academia NDT International has been officially founded and has its base office in Brescia (Italy) www.academia-ndt.org

==Methods and techniques==
[[Image:Replica system for nondestructive testing.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a 3D replicating technique. The flexible high-resolution replicas allow surfaces to be examined and measured under laboratory conditions. A replica can be taken from all solid materials.]]

NDT is divided into various ''methods'' of nondestructive testing, each based on a particular scientific principle. These methods may be further subdivided into various ''techniques''. The various methods and techniques, due to their particular natures, may lend themselves especially well to certain applications and be of little or no value at all in other applications. Therefore, choosing the right method and technique is an important part of the performance of NDT.

==Personnel training, qualification and certification==

Successful and consistent application of nondestructive testing techniques depends heavily on personnel training, experience and integrity. Personnel involved in application of industrial NDT methods and interpretation of results should be certified, and in some industrial sectors certification is enforced by law or by the applied codes and standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ndt.net/news/files/ICNDTGuidelinesJuly2012.pdf
|title=ICNDT Guide to Qualification and Certification of Personnel for NDT
|year=2012
|publisher=International Committee for NDT
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDT professionals and managers who seek to further their growth, knowledge and experience to remain competitive in the rapidly advancing technology field of nondestructive testing should consider joining NDTMA, a member organization of NDT Managers and Executives who work to provide a forum for the open exchange of managerial, technical and regulatory information critical to the successful management of NDT personnel and activities. Their annual conference at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas is a popular for its informative and relevant programming and exhibition space

===Definitions===

The following definitions for ''qualification'' and ''certification'' are given in [[DIN EN ISO 9712|ISO 9712]]:&lt;ref name="ISO9712"/&gt;

* '''Certification:''' Procedure, used by the certification body to confirm that the qualification requirements for a method, level and sector have been fulfilled, leading to the issuing of a certificate.
* '''Qualification:''' Demonstration of physical attributes, knowledge, skill, training and experience required to properly perform NDT tasks.

In US standards and codes, while a very similar definition of qualification is included in ASNT SNT-TC-1A, certification is simply defined as: "Written testimony of qualification".

In the aerospace sector, EN 4179:2009 contains the following definitions:&lt;ref name="EN4179"&gt;EN 4179: "Aerospace series. Qualification and approval of personnel for non-destructive testing" (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Certification:''' Written statement by an employer that an individual has met the applicable requirements of this standard.
* '''Qualification:''' The skills, training, knowledge, examinations, experience and visual capability required for personnel to properly perform to a particular level.

===Training===
Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) training is provided for people working in many industries. It is generally necessary that the [[candidate]] successfully completes a theoretical and practical training program, as well as have performed several hundred hours of practical application of the particular method they wish to be trained in. At this point, they may pass a certification examination.  While online training has become more popular, many certifying bodies will require additional practical training.

===Certification schemes===

There are two approaches in personnel certification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=John Thompson|title=Global review of qualification and certification of personnel for NDT and condition monitoring|conference=12th A-PCNDT 2006 – Asia-Pacific Conference on NDT|date=November 2006|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Employer Based Certification''': Under this concept the employer compiles their own ''Written Practice''. The written practice defines the responsibilities of each level of certification, as implemented by the company, and describes the training, experience and examination requirements for each level of certification. In industrial sectors the written practices are usually based on recommended practice SNT-TC-1A of the [[American Society for Nondestructive Testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Recommended Practice No. SNT-TC-1A: ''Personnel Qualification and Certification in Nondestructive Testing'', (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; ANSI standard CP-189 outlines requirements for any written practice that conforms to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ASNT CP-189: ''ASNT Standard for Qualification and Certification of Nondestructive Testing Personnel'', (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; For aviation, space, and defense (ASD) applications NAS 410 sets further requirements for NDT personnel, and is published by AIA – Aerospace Industries Association, which is made up of US aerospace airframe and powerplant manufacturers. This is the basis document for EN 4179&lt;ref name="EN4179"/&gt; and other (USA) NIST-recognized aerospace standards for the Qualification and Certification (employer-based) of Nondestructive Testing personnel. NAS 410 also sets the requirements also for "National NDT Boards", which allow and proscribe personal certification schemes. NAS 410 allows ASNT Certification as a portion of the qualifications needed for ASD certification.&lt;ref&gt;AIA NAS410&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Personal Central Certification''': The concept of central certification is that an NDT operator can obtain certification from a central certification authority, that is recognized by most employers, third parties and/or government authorities. Industrial standards for central certification schemes include ISO 9712,&lt;ref name="ISO9712"&gt;ISO 9712: ''Non-destructive testing -- Qualification and certification of NDT personnel'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and ANSI/ASNT CP-106&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ASNT CP-106: "ASNT Standard for Qualification and Certification of Nondestructive Testing Personnel" (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (used for the ASNT ACCP &lt;ref&gt;"ASNT Central Certification Program", ASNT Document ACCP-CP-1, Rev. 7 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; scheme). Certification under these standards involves training, work experience under supervision and passing a written and practical examination set up by the independent certification authority. EN 473&lt;ref name="EN473"&gt;EN 473: ''Non-destructive testing. Qualification and certification of NDT personnel. General principles'', (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; was another central certification scheme, very similar to ISO 9712, which was withdrawn when CEN replaced it with ''EN ISO 9712'' in 2012.

In the United States employer based schemes are the norm, however central certification schemes exist as well. The most notable is ''ASNT Level III'' (established in 1976-1977), which is organized by the [[American Society for Nondestructive Testing]] for Level 3 NDT personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NAVSEA 250-1500'' is another US central certification scheme, specifically developed for use in the naval nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central certification is more widely used in the European Union, where certifications are issued by [[Personnel certification body|accredited bodies]] (independent organizations conforming to ISO 17024 and accredited by a national accreditation authority like UKAS). The [[Pressure Equipment Directive]] (97/23/EC) actually enforces central personnel certification for the initial testing of [[steam boiler]]s and some categories of [[pressure vessel]]s and [[piping]].&lt;ref&gt;''Directive 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment'', Annex I, paragraph 3.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; European Standards harmonized with this directive specify personnel certification to EN 473. Certifications issued by a national NDT society which is a member of the [[European Federation of NDT]] (EFNDT) are mutually acceptable by the other member societies &lt;ref&gt;EFNDT/SEC/P/05-006: ''[http://www.efndt.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=McGXzQepYA0%3D&amp;tabid=408&amp;mid=1707 Agreement for EFNDT multilateral recognition of NDT personnel certification schemes]'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; under a multilateral recognition agreement.

Canada also implements an ISO 9712 central certification scheme, which is administered by [[Natural Resources Canada]], a government department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/smm-mms/ndt-end/index-eng.htm : The NDT Certifying Agency (CANMET-MTL)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The relevant national standard for Canada is CAN/CGSB-48.9712-2006 "Qualification and Certification of Non-Destructive Testing Personnel.", which complies with the requirements of ISO 9712:2005 and EN 473:2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aerospace]] sector worldwide sticks to employer based schemes.&lt;ref&gt;R. Marini and P. Ranos: "[http://www.ndt.net/article/ecndt2006/doc/Th.3.6.5.pdf Current Issues in Qualification and Certification of Non-Destructive Testing Personnel in the Aerospace Industry]", ''ECNDT 2006 - Th.3.6.5''&lt;/ref&gt; In America it is based mostly on AIA-NAS-410 &lt;ref&gt;AIA-NAS-410: "Aerospace Industries Association, National Aerospace Standard, NAS Certification and Qualification of Nondestructive Test Personnel"&lt;/ref&gt; and in the European Union on the equivalent and very similar standard EN 4179.&lt;ref name="EN4179"/&gt;  However EN 4179:2009 includes an option for central qualification and certification by a ''National aerospace NDT board'' or ''NANDTB'' (paragraph 4.5.2).

===Levels of certification===

Most NDT personnel certification schemes listed above specify three "levels" of qualification and/or certification, usually designated as ''Level 1'', ''Level 2'' and ''Level 3'' (although some codes specify Roman numerals, like ''Level II''). The roles and responsibilities of personnel in each level are generally as follows (there are slight differences or variations between different codes and standards):&lt;ref name="ISO9712"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EN4179"/&gt;

* '''Level 1''' are [[technician]]s qualified to perform only specific [[calibration]]s and tests under close supervision and direction by higher level personnel. They can only report test results. Normally they work following specific work instructions for testing procedures and rejection criteria.
* '''Level 2''' are [[engineers]] or experienced technicians who are able to set up and calibrate testing equipment, conduct the inspection according to codes and standards (instead of following work instructions) and compile work instructions for Level 1 technicians. They are also authorized to report, interpret, evaluate and document testing results. They can also supervise and train Level 1 technicians. In addition to testing methods, they must be familiar with applicable codes and standards and have some knowledge of the manufacture and service of tested products.
* '''Level 3''' are usually specialized engineers or very experienced technicians. They can establish NDT techniques and procedures and interpret codes and standards. They also direct NDT laboratories and have central role in personnel certification. They are expected to have wider knowledge covering materials, fabrication and product technology.

==Terminology==
The standard US terminology for Nondestructive testing is defined in standard ASTM E-1316.&lt;ref name="E1316"&gt;ASTM E-1316: "Standard Terminology for Nondestructive Examinations", ''[[ASTM International|The American Society for Testing and Materials]]'', in Volume 03.03 NDT, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions may be different in European  standard EN 1330.

;Indication : The response or evidence from an examination, such as a blip on the screen of an instrument. Indications are classified as ''true'' or ''false''. ''False indications'' are those caused by factors not related to the principles of the testing method or by improper implementation of the method, like film damage in radiography, electrical interference in ultrasonic testing etc. ''True indications'' are further classified as ''relevant'' and ''non relevant''. ''Relevant indications'' are those caused by flaws. ''Non relevant indications'' are those caused by known features of the tested object, like gaps, threads, case hardening etc.
;Interpretation : Determining if an indication is of a type to be investigated. For example, in electromagnetic testing, indications from metal loss are considered flaws because they should usually be investigated, but indications due to variations in the material properties may be harmless and nonrelevant.
;Flaw : A type of discontinuity that must be investigated to see if it is rejectable. For example, porosity in a weld or metal loss.
;Evaluation : Determining if a flaw is rejectable. For example, is porosity in a weld larger than acceptable by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers#ASME Codes and Standards|code]]?
;Defect : A flaw that is rejectable – i.e. does not meet acceptance criteria. Defects are generally removed or repaired.&lt;ref name="E1316"/&gt;

==Reliability and statistics==
Probability of detection (POD) tests are a standard way to evaluate a nondestructive testing technique in a given set of circumstances, for example "What is the POD of lack of fusion flaws in pipe welds using manual ultrasonic testing?" The POD will usually increase with flaw size. A common error in POD tests is to assume that the percentage of flaws detected is the POD, whereas the percentage of flaws detected is merely the first step in the analysis. Since the number of flaws tested is necessarily a limited number (non-infinite), statistical methods must be used to determine the POD for all possible defects, beyond the limited number tested. Another common error in POD tests is to define the statistical sampling units (test items) as flaws, whereas a true sampling unit is an item that may or may not contain a flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Oldberg and R. Christensen| title=Erratic Measure |url=http://www.ndt.net/article/v04n05/oldberg/oldberg.htm |publisher=NDT.net |volume=4 |issue=5 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T.

If a 95% degree of confidence is also considered in determination of defect length with 90% probability, it is a90/95.&lt;ref&gt;Abolfazl Zolfaghari, Amin Zolfaghari, Farhad Kolahan (2018) "Reliability and sensitivity of magnetic particle nondestructive testing in detecting surface cracks of welded components”, Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation, 33 (3), 290-300. https://doi.org/10.1080/10589759.2018.1428322&lt;/ref&gt;Guidelines for correct application of statistical methods to POD tests can be found in ASTM E2862 Standard Practice for Probability of Detection Analysis for Hit/Miss Data and MIL-HDBK-1823A Nondestructive Evaluation System Reliability Assessment, from the U.S. Department of Defense Handbook.

'''Ola Ahlvarsson''' (born March 24, 1970) is a Swedish entrepreneur based out of Stockholm, Ibiza and Miami. He is one of the founders of Result&lt;ref&gt;http://www.result.com&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the chairman of its board.

Ahlvarsson has a background as an entrepreneur working as an Internet strategist, business accelerator and a managerial advisor for Fortune 500 and small medium-sized companies to help them grow faster. Ahlvarsson has authored the book 'Ola "Mission Possible" Ahlvarsson' which was published in Swedish by Midas in 2005,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbm-forlag.com/dok/mission_possible.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An English version of the same book was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.symbio-group.com/?p=11&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlvarsson is a frequent speaker at various international leading industry events such as the World Economic Forum, DLD, Le Web amongst others. He holds an MBA from the [[University of Stockholm]] and, was the course director and the executive MBA Program Faculty member at [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sseriga.edu.lv/&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlvarsson also holds the World champion title in kickboxing (Wakko).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wakoweb.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurial Activities==

Ola was part of several Swedish start up companies after leaving school, Swedish Body Armour Group, Soups &amp; Subs, Music Zone and Internet Media Web Store as well as investing in a small real estate operation in Bollnäs, Sweden.

In 1997, Ahlvarsson was one of the early pioneers of the European Internet scene as a co-founder of Boxman, at the time the largest European e-commerce store selling CDs online. Boxman was founded by two teams of entrepreneurs, one with roots in Musiczone.se, with Fredrik Sidfalk, Ola Ahlvarsson and Gustaf Burström and, the other with roots in Videobutiken led by Krister Hanner, Kent Granat, Bill Odqvist and Håkan Damberg. The company was founded by among others, former SAS CEO Jan Carlzon and Kjell Spångberg. Ahlvarsson was Vice President International and helped internationalize operations for the company, setting up local offices in various European markets.

During his stint with Boxman, while trying to internationalize its operations, Ahlvarsson conceived the idea of creating a company that could help companies parachute success from one market to the other by creating a service organisation that works as an extended arm and leg to the management team to internationalise faster and cheaper, similar to the way music labels worked with the artists in the record industry.

==Result==

In June 1999, Result was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. Result is an international network of business coaches founded in Stockholm, that helps companies execute success across various markets using new business methods / technology. To date, Result has been involved in approximately 150 launches across Europe, the US and Asia. He was the CEO of Result from June 1999 to November 2008. Ahlvarsson is currently the chairman of Result.

In 2005, Ahlvarsson assisted in the launch of [[Fon (company)|Fon]], today the world's largest WiFi Community, expanding FON into Scandinavia and Russia. Ahlvarsson and his partners at Result have been responsible for the growth of professional online network [[XING]] (formerly called openBC) in Scandinavia, Benelux, France and Spain. Ahlvarsson has worked with several other leading companies such as Blocket,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blocket.se&lt;/ref&gt; Rebtel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebtel.com&lt;/ref&gt; Movilisto, Polarrose, [[Google]], helping them grow in various capacities.

Ahlvarsson was most recently on the board of Emmy award-winning Company P, leading Swedish fitness retailer Budo Fitness stores,  luxury magazine Connoisseur and the chairman and main shareholder of [[Nöjesguiden]], Sweden's largest entertainment magazine. Ahlvarsson also co-founded Sellbranch together with Advertising veteran Fredrik Sellgren&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/dig/article106138.ece&lt;/ref&gt; to build a premium yield-management ad system&lt;ref&gt;[[Yield management]]&lt;/ref&gt; driven by strong sales and technology.

In 2008, Ola Ahlvarsson and 3 Result partners acquired 100% of the shares in Spray (former Lycos)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spray.se&lt;/ref&gt; one of Europe's pioneer brand on the web with a portal business that includes Spraydate,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spraydate.se&lt;/ref&gt; a leading Swedish dating site in the fun and flirt segment and Spraymail, Sweden's largest independent mail service. The same constellation also acquired [[Passagen]], Sweden's largest blog portal and discussion forum. The sellers where media house Allers and directories company [[Eniro]].

Together with Spray, Spraydate, Spraymail, Passagen, Nöjesguiden and Sellbranch, the owners consolidated all the companies to form a new age media company. The vision of all the acquisitions was to bring together reach and new technological formats in the advertising world. The media group was called Keynote Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keynotemediagroup.se/&lt;/ref&gt; During 2013 and 2014, Keynote Media Group properties were sold. Spraydate was sold to Match.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/dig/article3646987.ece&lt;/ref&gt; and Spray was sold to Snowfall in 2014. Nöjesguiden was acquired by investors and the management in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resume.se/nyheter/media/2013/11/04/nojesguiden-far-ny-agare/&lt;/ref&gt; A majority stake was acquired in Sellbranch by Swiss Media company Publi Grouppe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publigroupe.com/en/investor-media-relations/press-releases/news-details/article/1398697991-publigroupe-acquires-premium-yield-management-services-provider-sellbranch/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahlvarsson is also a co-founder of Starstable.com,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starstable.com&lt;/ref&gt; the first serious MMO for girls focusing on horse riding, adventures in a world where fantasy meets reality of love for horses. Starstable today is available for horse lovers across Europe, Americas and Australia.

Ahlvarsson has portfolios in [[Fon (company)|Fon]], Ulvhälls Herrgård, Wemind, Antipode Wines, Result, SIME, some parts of Keynote Media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keynotemediagroup.se&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlvarsson was the chairman and main shareholder of Torget, Sweden's oldest e-commerce portal with over 400 Swedish e-commerce partners until it was sold to European Directories in 2005. Ahlvarsson also served as the chairman and main shareholder in Letsbuyit.com that was sold to Europe Vision in 2006.

==Stage presence==

Ahlvarsson is a frequent speaker in conferences and industry events, some of which include Le Web Paris,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lewebparis.com&lt;/ref&gt; Tech Talk Menorca,&lt;ref&gt;http://menorcatechtalk.com/&lt;/ref&gt; DLD,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dld-conference.com/&lt;/ref&gt; PICNIC Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picnicnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Knowledge Forum]] in Seoul, the "World Economic Forum", the "Global Internet Summit" and the "European Online Publishing Conference". Ahlvarsson is also the curator and host of SIME&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sime.nu&lt;/ref&gt; which has events in Stockholm and Miami in 2014.

==Awards and honors==

Ahlvarsson has been in the epicenter of the entrepreneurial boom that has grown in Scandinavia and in Europe which has led to nominations such as "Top Ten Leading European Internet Entrepreneurs 1999" by the Wall Street Journal. Similar honors have been rendered by Business Week (January 2000) and Financial Times (May 2000). Ahlvarsson has twice been invited to the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, where he has been elected "Global Leader for Tomorrow" together with thought leading businessmen, political-, religious- and artistic leaders.

In 2004 Ahlvarsson became an E-Strategies Course Director and Executive MBA Program lecturer at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in Riga. Ahlvarsson is focusing on what he describes as “Internet Management” and teaching executive MBA students how to compete using online opportunities. Although a resident of Stockholm, Ahlvarsson spends most of his time living in airplanes and hotels around the world.

In 2014, Ahlvarsson was awarded the "keys to the city of Miami" by Mayor Phillip Levine for his contributions to the entrepreneurial community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152631624722463&amp;set=a.10150846096202463.472044.615342462&amp;type=1&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Petras Vileišis.jpg|thumb|Petras Vileišis]]
'''Petras Vileišis''' (January 25, 1851 – August 12, 1926) was a prominent [[Lithuania]]n engineer, political activist, and [[philanthropist]].

His early schooling took place in [[Panevežys]]. He then completed his secondary education at the [[Šiauliai Gymnasium]], graduating with honors. In 1874, he completed his studies at [[St. Petersburg University]], with degrees in physics and mathematics. While at the university he had illegally distributed Lithuanian publications, which were forbidden due to the ban of the Lithuanian language by the [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist]] authorities. With two of his brothers, [[Jonas Vileišis|Jonas]] and [[Antanas Vileišis|Antanas]], he belonged to the underground "Twelve Apostles" organization.

Later he accumulated a great fortune as a result of his work as an engineer, much of which he distributed to Lithuanian social organizations. Petras Vileišis established in 1904 the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper [[Vilniaus žinios]] in [[Vilnius]]. He was also a patron of the arts and sponsored the [[First Lithuanian Art Exhibition]], which took place [[Vileišis Palace Ensemble|at his palatial home]] in 1907.

In 1926, while on vacation in [[Palanga]], Petras Vileišis died, and was buried in Kaunas. He was reburied, nine years later, in Vilnius' [[Rasos Cemetery]] in 1935.

'''Probosutedjo''' (1 May 1930 – 26 March 2018) was the younger half-brother of former [[Indonesia]]n president [[Suharto]]. Like many Indonesians, [[Indonesian names|he took only one name]]. Probosutedjo was one of seven children from his mother's second marriage, his father being Atmopawiro and his mother (also Suharto's mother) Sukirah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Soeharto, as related to G. Dwipayana and Ramadhan K.H.|date=1989|title=Soeharto: Pikiran, ucapan dan tindakan saya: otobiografi|trans-title=Soeharto: My thoughts, words and deeds: an autobiography|publisher=PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada|place=Jakarta|ISBN=979-8085-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Like Suharto, he was born and raised in the small hamlet of [[Kemusuk]] to the west of the main town of [[Yogyakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt;Brief details are provided in R.E. Elson, 2001, ''Suharto: A political biography'', Cambridge UK, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 1. {{ISBN|0-521-77326-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Suharto was the only child of their mother's first marriage.)&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, H., ''Suharto's Indonesia'', page, 10. Fontana Books, 1980, Blackburn, Australia, {{ISBN|0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his life, Probosutedjo maintained a close relationship with Suharto.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the various references in Elson, ''op. cit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Probosutedjo's business activities flourished under Suharto's [[Orde Baru|New Order]] government. He developed business opportunities in the forestry sector having founded the ''PT Menara Hutan Buana'' company to carry on forestry activities. During the period of the New Order government, he co-founded the Indonesian Indigenous Entrepreneurs Association (HIPPI), a move that reportedly drew the ire of president Suharto.

In the 1980s, he was active in supporting the establishment of the [[Mercu Buana University]] in Indonesia with several campuses in various parts of Jakarta.

During the 1970s, some of Probosutedjo's activities had became the focus of corruption allegations.&lt;ref name="McDonald"/&gt; In 2003, he was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] into the alleged scandal of the "judicial mafia" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on November 30, 2005.

Like other members of the extended Suharto family, he remained a supporter of his brother's activities after Suharto's death in 2008.  He joined with others in recalling personal memories about Suharto in a book, ''Pak Harto: The untold stories'', published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Probosutedjo, 2011, ''Lagi-lagi kena tegur'' [''Scolded again''], in Chapter 5, Mahpudi ''et. al.'' (editors), ''Pak Harto: The untold stories'', Jakarta, PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama.  {{ISBN|978-979-22-7131-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2013, he supported the publication of a book of anecdotes from palace-based reporters remembering Suharto entitled ''34 Palace Journalists talk about Pak Harto.''

Probosutedjo died on 26 March 2018 at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asril|first1=Sabrina|title=Biodata Probosutedjo, Sang Pengusaha Orde Baru|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2018/03/26/10094201/biodata-probosutedjo-sang-pengusaha-orde-baru|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=Kompas.com|date=26 March 2018}} and '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/26/soehartos-half-brother-dies-at-87-years-of-age.html Soeharto's half-brother dies at 87 years of age'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the same day his body was taken to his home village of Kemusuk near Yogyakarta accompanied by his family and members of the Suharto family including [[Titiek Suharto]] and Mamiek Suharto.  A large crowd of local people from the Kemusuk area attended a ceremony for his burial in the local Soemenggalan cemetery. &lt;ref&gt;Markus Yuwono, '[https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/03/26/20232241/jenazah-probosutedjo-tiba-di-pemakaman Jenazah Probosutedjo tiba di pemakaman'] ['Probosutedjo's body arrives for burial'], ''Kompas'', 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is survived by his wife Ratmani Probosutedjo and six children Diniarti Pertiwi, Septanto, Rita Ria Kurnianta, Rindangsari Kurniawati, Nurani Pujiastuti, and Priasto.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Cameron, Missouri]] to Julius B. and Jessie M. Corn Kester, Kester attended Cameron High School, and obtained his BA in economics in 1902 at [[Missouri Wesleyan College]]. About a decade later he obtained another BA from the [[University of Denver]], in 1911. He continued his studies at [[Columbia University]], where he obtained his MA in 1912 and his PhD in 1919. In between, in 1914, he obtained his CPA license for the State of Colorado.&lt;ref name="AH0F 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/roy-bernard-kester/ |title=Roy Bernard Kester|publisher=[[The Accounting Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kester had started his academic career at the [[Missouri Wesleyan College]] in 1902, and from 1907 he was also lecturer at East Denver High School and subsequently at the [[University of Denver]]. In 1915 he moved to [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he worked his way up from Assistant Professor in 1919, to Associate Professor in 1920, and to Full Professor in 1922. He served until his retirement in 1948. Among his PhD students was [[Henry Whitcomb Sweeney]] (1898-1967).&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Mosich. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/1520 Henry Whitcomb Sweeney]," in: ''[[Accounting Historians Journal]],'' Vol. 1, Nr. 1-4. p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911 on, Kester also was working as a practising public accountant, and had joined the New York accountancy firm Boyce, Hughes and Farrell in 1917.&lt;ref name="AH0F 2015"/&gt;

Kester was elected vice president of the [[American Accounting Association]] from 1922 to 1925, and served as its president during 1925. From 1925 to 1928 he served at the [[National Academy of Arbitrators]] as director of research in cost and management accounting, as successor of Professor Gould Harris of New York.&lt;ref name="RMK 2014"&gt;[[M. Chatfield]] &amp; [[R. Vangermeersch]] (eds.) ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia: An International Encyclopedia.''

'''PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk.''' (commonly known as '''Sampoerna''') is an Indonesian [[tobacco]] company owned by [[Philip Morris International]]. Sampoerna is the largest Indonesian tobacco company, ahead of [[Gudang Garam]] and [[Djarum]]. It produces ''[[kretek]]''-type clove cigarettes. A typical brand is Sampoerna 'A' Mild, a filter cigarette in white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carollina |first1=Donna |title=Rejection of the Cigarette Billboard Sampoerna A Mild “Mula Mula Malu-Malu, Lama Lama Mau” |journal=International Journal of Creative and Arts Studies |date=29 December 2017 |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=13 |doi=10.24821/ijcas.v3i2.1841 |url=https://doi.org/10.24821/ijcas.v3i2.1841 |issn=2406-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1930s, [[Liem Seeng Tee]] adopted the Indonesian name Sampoerna (in [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], cf. [[wikt:sempurna|sempurna]]) meaning "perfection" as his family name, thus becoming the company's namesake. Sampoerna began producing Dji Sam Soe in 1913 in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]]. Following Seeng Tee's death in 1956, his two daughters took over the running of the company, while his two sons ran separate tobacco-related businesses. The daughters shifted the company's focus toward white cigarettes, which nearly caused bankruptcy for Sampoerna. Youngest son Liem Swie Ling, who ran a kretek factory in Bali, returned to Surabaya in 1959 to rescue the company. He shifted production back to hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe brand cigarettes. In 1968, the company launched Sampoerna A Hijau. By the mid-1970s, the company was producing over 1 million cigarettes daily and had 1,200 staff. Swie Ling in the 1970s began to hand over the running of the company to his second-eldest son, Liem Tien Pao, better known as Putera Sampoerna, who went on to modernize the company and expand its operations.&lt;ref name="Hanusz2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hanusz|title=Kretek: The Culture and Heritage of Indonesia's Clove Cigarettes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMrfAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Equinox Pub.|isbn=978-979-95898-0-4|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Sampoerna A Mild was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profil Poetra Sampoerna – Peringkat 9 Orang Terkaya Indonesia|url=https://www.byrest.com/profil-poetra-sampoerna-peringkat-9-orang-terkaya-indonesia.htm|website=Byrest.com|language=Indonesian|publisher=Byrest.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2005, Philip Morris International, at that time a subsidiary of the [[Altria Group]], completed the acquisition of 97.95% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/doing-business/indonesian-companies/hm-sampoerna/item204|title=Indonesia-Investments.com:HM Sampoerna company profile  |date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HM Sampoerna's current president is Paul Norman Janelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Post |first1=The Jakarta |title=HM Sampoerna appoints new boss |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/19/hm-sampoerna-appoints-new-boss.html |website=The Jakarta Post |language=en |date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of May 2014, Sampoerna closed its Lumajang and Jember factories and laid off 4,900 employees due to declining sales of hand-rolled kretek cigarette as consumers moved to buy machine-made kretek cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last1=Fajar|editor-first1=Deni Ahmad |url=http://jabar.tribunnews.com/2014/05/16/tutup-dua-pabrik-pt-hm-sampoerna-phk-4900-karyawan |title=Tutup Dua Pabrik, PT HM Sampoerna PHK 4.900 Karyawan |language=Indonesian|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the company was criticized for its approach to "corporate social responsibility" efforts when Mount Merapi in Central Java began erupting. The disaster relief teams which "aim to augment efforts by a stretched Indonesian government to house, clothe and feed evacuees from the volcano," were criticized for "the flashy four-wheel drive vehicles," and "the cluster of eager staffers wearing natty red and black uniforms covered with company logos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carless|first1=Will|title=Cigarette Companies Sponsor Volcano Rescue Efforts|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131094364|website=NPR.org|language=en|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19559">The '''sexual division of labour''' ('''SDL''') is the [[delegation]] of different tasks between males and females. Among human foragers, males and females target different types of foods and share them with each other for a mutual or familial benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Frank. "Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor." Cross-Cultural Research.  41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, males and females eat slightly different foods, while in other species, males and females will routinely share food; but only in humans are these two attributes combined.&lt;ref&gt;Zihlman, A., and NM Tanner. "Gathering and the hominid adaptation." Anthropology Origins. 10.99 (2001): 163-194. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The few remaining [[hunter-gatherer]] populations in the world serve as [[Evolution|evolutionary]] models that can help explain the origin of the sexual division of labor. Many studies on the sexual division of labor have been conducted on hunter-gatherer populations, such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]], a [[hunter-gatherer]] population of [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Frank. (2010). The Hadza: the Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ecological perspective ==

===Man the hunter vs. woman the gatherer ===
{{See also|Women's work}}
Both men and women have the option of investing resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive [[fitness (biology)|fitness]];&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"&gt;Bird, R. "Cooperation and conflict: the behavioral ecology of the sexual division of labor." Evolutionary Anthropology. 8.2 (1999): 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from [[parental]] effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the [[Aeta]]&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Woman the Gatherer|author=Dahlberg, F.|date=1983|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300029895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;pg=PA120|page=120|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ju'/hoansi]]&lt;ref&gt;Biesele, Megan; Barclay, Steve (March 2001). "Ju/'Hoan Women's Tracking Knowledge And Its Contribution To Their Husbands' Hunting Success". African Study Monographs Suppl.26: 67–84&lt;/ref&gt;), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. [[Natural selection]] is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize [[parental investment]].&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"/&gt; As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering [[vegetation]] and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring.&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"/&gt; Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.

This classic theory of natural selection positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that [[promiscuity]] was encouraged [[Female promiscuity|among women]] and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due to the possibility that any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the [[bonobo]].&lt;ref name="psychologytoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201108/ill-fated-interview-part-i|title=Ill-Fated Interview Part I &amp;#124; Psychology Today|publisher=psychologytoday.com|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Lovgren. "Sex-Based Roles Gave Modern Humans an Edge, Study Says".

== Hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of SDL ==

=== Traditional hypothesis ===

====''Provisioning household''====

The traditional explanation of the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within [[pair bond]]s by targeting different foods so that everyone in the household benefits.&lt;ref name="Lee-Devore 30-48"&gt;Lee and I. Devore, "What hunters do for a living, or How to make out on scare resources," in Man the Hunter. pp. 30-48. Chicago:Aldine&lt;/ref&gt; Females may target foods that do not conflict with [[reproduction]] and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which will reduce variance in daily consumption and provide a broader diet for the family.&lt;ref name="Lee-Devore 30-48"/&gt; [[Foraging]] specialization in particular food groups should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods.

=== Alternative hypotheses ===

====''"Show-Off" / Signaling hypothesis''====
The "show‐off" hypothesis proposes that men hunt to gain social attention and mating benefits by widely sharing game. This model proposes that [[hunting]] functions mainly to provide an honest signal of the underlying genetic quality of hunters, which later yields a mating advantage or social deference.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, K, and Bird Bliege. "Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work." Evolutionary Anthropology. 11. (2002): 58-67. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Females tend to target the foods that are most reliable, while men tend to target difficult-to-acquire foods to "signal" their abilities and genetic quality. Hunting is thus viewed as a form of mating or male-male status competition, not familial [[wikt:provisioning|provisioning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, K. "Why do men hunt? Some benefits for risky strategies.." E. Cashdan. (1990): 145-166. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies on the Hadza have revealed that men hunt mainly to distribute food to their own families rather than sharing with other members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, B., and K Hill. "A Test of the "Showing-Off" Hypothesis with Ache Hunters." Current Anthropology. 10.99 (2000): 124-25. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion suggests evidence against hunting for signaling purposes.

==="The Victorian Period"===
The Victorian era that has been so closely examined by Sally Shuttleworth and company shed light on women during the Victorian era. They played dual roles and were expected to deliver with conviction in the aspects in which they were required to perform duties in and outside of the household. She states, "Two traditional tropes are here combined: Victorian medical textbooks demonstrated not only woman's biological fitness and adaptation to the sacred role of homemaker, but also her terrifying subjection to the forces of the body. At once angel and demon, woman came to represent both the civilizing power that would cleanse the male from contamination in the brutal world of the economic market and also the rampant, uncontrolled excesses of the material economy."&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuttleworth|first=Sally|title=Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." *Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=47–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SDL and optimal foraging theory ==

Optimal foraging theory (OFT) states that organisms forage in such a way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, F. "Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor." Cross-Cultural Research.  41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, animals behave in such a way as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy that would seem suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an [[adaptation]] that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, F. "A critical period for provisioning by Hadza men: Implications for pair bonding." Evolution and Human Behavior. 24. (2003): 217-29. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; If a hunter-gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with caloric value, it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long as men and women share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, C. (2007). "How Marginal are forager habitats?." Journal of Archeological. 34. (2007): 59-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooking and the sexual division of labor ==

The emergence of [[cooking]] in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked.&lt;ref name=Wrangham&gt;Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. "The Raw and the Stolen." Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, females would recruit male partners to protect them and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation as to why the [[Manual labour|labor]] of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt; Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt; On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt;

== Sexual division of labor and the evolution of sex differences ==

Many studies investigating the spatial abilities of men and women have found no significant differences,&lt;ref&gt;Corley, DeFries, Kuse, Vandenberg. 1980. ''Familial Resemblance for the Identical Blocks Test of Spatial Ability: No Evidence of X Linkage''. Behavior Genetics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. Sherman. 1978.

Those differences disappear with a short training &lt;ref name=Petra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ788119 |title=ERIC - Manual Training of Mental Rotation in Children, Learning and Instruction, 2008-Feb – Experiment of Wiedenbauer, Gunnar; Jansen-Osmann, Petra (2008) |publisher=eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when given a favorable image of woman ability.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Krieger-rec5-Steele_Threat-in-the-Air.pdf |title=Article by Claude Steele, "A Threat in the Air - How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance" in 1997, "American Psychologist" |publisher=users.nber.org|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the individual differences are greater than the average differences, which isn't therefore a valid prediction of a man or woman cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Vidal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12152-011-9121-9 |title=The Sexed Brain: Between Science and Ideology |author= Catherine Vidal|accessdate=2015-07-12|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9121-9|volume=5|journal=Neuroethics|pages=295–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis argues that males needed the ability to follow prey over long distances and to accurately target their game with projectile technology, and, as a result, male specialization in hunting prowess would have spurred the selection for increased spatial and navigational ability. Similarly, the ability to remember the locations of underground storage organs and other vegetation would have led to an increase in overall efficiency and decrease in total energy expenditure since the time spent searching for food would decrease.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Geary. Sexual selection, the division of labor, and the evolution of sex differences. Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 21. (1998): 444-447. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection based on behaviors that increase hunting success and energetic efficiency would bear a positive influence on [[reproductive success]]. However, recent research suggests that the sexual division of labor developed relatively recently and that gender roles were not always the same in early-human cultures, contradicting the theory that each sex is naturally predisposed to different types of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-sex-humans.html |title=Sex-Based Roles Gave Modern Humans an Edge, Study Says |work=National Geographic News |author=Stefan Lovgren |accessdate=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of the division of gender roles have been an ongoing debate and Gerda Lerner quotes the philosopher Socrates to demonstrate that the idea of defined gender roles is patriarchal. It also identifies how men and women are capable of performing the same job descriptions with the exception of when it calls for anatomical differences, such as giving birth. "In Book V of the Republic, Plato—in the voice of Socrates—sets down the conditions for the training of the guardians, his elite leadership group. Socrates proposes that women should have the same opportunity as men to be trained as guardians. In support of this he offers a strong statement against making sex differences the basis for discrimination: if the difference [between men and women] consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not amount to proof that a woman differs from a man in respect to the sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits.&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Creation opf Patriarchy|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continues to add that with the same set of established resources such as education, training and teaching, it creates an atmosphere of equity which helps to further the cause of gender equality. "Socrates proposes the same education for boys and girls, freeing guardian women from housework and child-care. But this female equality of opportunity will serve a larger purpose: the destruction of the family. Plato's aim is to abolish private property, the private family, and with it self-interest in his leadership group, for he sees clearly that private property engenders class antagonism and disharmony. Therefore "men and women are to have a common way of life. . . —common education, common children; and they are to watch over the citizens in common. "&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Creation of Patriarchy|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers, such as [[Cordelia Fine]], argue that available evidence does not support a biological basis for gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Significance: Why the sexual division of labor? ==

===''Evolutionary perspective''===

Based on the current theories and research on the sexual division of labor, four critical aspects of hunter‐gatherer socioecology led to the evolutionary origin of the SDL in humans: (1) long‐term dependency on high‐cost offspring,&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, R. "Ecology and Mode of Production: Seasonal Variation and the Division of Labor by Sex Among Hunter-Gatherers." Journal of Anthropological Research. 36 (1980): 379-399. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) optimal dietary mix of mutually exclusive foods,&lt;ref&gt;Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. "The Raw and the Stolen." Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; (3) efficient foraging based on specialized skill, and (4) sex‐differentiated comparative advantage in tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, A. M., Hill, K., Kaplan, H., &amp; Hurtado, I. (1992). Trade-offs between female food acquisition and child care among Hiwi and Ache foragers. Human Nature. 3.3. (1992): 185 – 216.&lt;/ref&gt; These combined conditions are rare in nonhuman vertebrates but common to currently-existing populations of human foragers, which, thus, gives rise to a potential factor for the evolutionary divergence of social behaviors in ''Homo''.
