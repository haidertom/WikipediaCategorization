      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">{{about||the 1989 film|Anecdote (film)|a comparison of anecdote with other kinds of stories|traditional story}}
An '''''anecdote''''' is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|title=Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, Third Ed.|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally [[humor]]ous, anecdotes differ from [[joke]]s because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke [[laughter]] but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific [[wikt:quirk|quirk]] or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Epstein|first=Lawrence|title=A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes|year=1989|publisher=Jason Aronson|location=Northvale, NJ|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote is "a story with a point."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1989|pp=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anecdotes may be real or fictional;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Kennedy |first=X. J.|title=Handbook of Literary Terms, Third Ed.|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuddon|1992|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |contributor-first=Jurgen |contributor-last=Heine |contribution=Die Anekdote |last=Knorrich |first=Otto |title=Formen der Literatur in Einzeldarstellugen |year=1981 |publisher=Alfred Kroner|location=Stuttgart|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident, involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place. In the words of Jurgen Heine, they exhibit "a special realism" and "a claimed historical dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heine|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied&lt;ref&gt;Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== Qualification as evidence ==
{{main|Anecdotal evidence}}
Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.

'''''Antônia''''' is a 2006 Brazilian drama [[musical film]] which tells the story of Antônia, an [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] [[girl group]] formed by four young women living on a ''[[favela]]'' of [[São Paulo]]. On their way to the mainstream success, they have to face with the [[violence]] near their homes and the ''[[sexism]]'' of the musical business. The film was directed by [[Tata Amaral]] and stars [[Negra Li]], [[Cindy Mendes]], [[Leilah Moreno]] and [[Quelynah]] as the members of the group.

It was shot in [[Santo André]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The film had its European premiere January 26, 2007 at the 36th [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], in the section "Cinema of the World: Time &amp; Tide". It was released commercially in the [[United States]] on September 21, 2007, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].

The movie, spun off from a 2006 short by Amaral, in turn spun off a [[television series]] from [[02 Filmes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in the filmmaker's native Brazil, starring the same actors in the same roles.&lt;ref name="bo"&gt;[http://www.boxoffice.com/moviedetail.aspx?movieid=5118 ''Box Office'' (Sept. 21, 2007): Review by Tim Cogshell]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On Vila Brasilândia, a ''[[favela]]'' (shanty town) of São Paulo, four [[Afro-Brazilian]] girls battle to fulfill their dream of making a living off their music. Friends since the childhood, Preta (Negra Li), Bárbarah (Leilah Moreno), Mayah (Quelynah&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt;) and Lena (Cindy Mendes, a.k.a. Maria Madalena,&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt; as Cindy) quit singing the [[backing vocals]] for a male [[rap music|rap]] group and form Antônia, their own group. Discovered by the smooth-talking manager Marcelo Diamante (Thaíde), they begin to sing rap, [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]] in bars and in middle-class parties.

Preta is the deep-voiced mother of a young daughter, Emília (Nathalye Cris). Mayah is the most sexually provocative though single and the high-voiced Lena lives alone with her boyfriend. Bárbarah is the sister of Duda (Chico Santo), an athletic young man with whom she frequently practices [[martial arts]]. Duda's exposed [[homosexuality]] brings a rising action into the story in which his gay partner is killed by a gang and Duda himself injured. Duda, however, recovers; despite this sudden crisis, the future begins to look bright again as the band Antônia begins to take flight.

Just when the dream of the quartet seems to becoming true, their hopes are dashed by daily events, such as [[poverty]], male oppression, and further street violence, which threaten the group and place the young women's friendship in jeopardy.

The conflict begins when Mayah flirts with Preta's estranged husband Ermano (Fernando Macário), and Preta forces Mayah out of the group, deciding to raise Emília by herself with the help of her parents. Next, Lena reveals that she is pregnant and must quit the group after her boyfriend, who originally wanted an abortion, puts pressure on her to do so if they are to raise the child. Bárbarah, meanwhile, is walking home one night with Preta when she is confronted and harassed by a young member of the same gang who attacked her brother; she defends herself using martial arts, throwing him heavily to the ground and resulting in his hospitalization. The boy dies in the hospital and Bárbarah is arrested and imprisoned for [[manslaughter]].

Preta, who struggles with her own personal troubles and the strain of raising her child alone, is the final member of Antônia left. At last unable to feel any desire to continue the group or rise to fame (as Marcelo encourages) if her friends cannot be with her, she goes to Mayah's house to apologize and reconcile. They, along with Lena, visit a grateful, teary-eyed Bárbarah in prison; they decide to spend their time with her writing a song about their experiences.

The scene changes to some point in the future in which all four members of Antônia are back together, singing onstage a liberation-themed song, ''Antônia''.

'''Apollinary Gilyarievich Goravsky''', also seen as '''Horawski''' (Belarusian: Апалінарый Гіляравіч Гараўскі, Russian: Аполлинарий Гиляриевич Горавский; 23 January 1833, Uborky, [[Minsk Governorate]] - 28 March 1900, Kirilovich, [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]]) was a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] painter.

== Biography ==
Apalinar (Apollinary) was born into an impoverished family of the Belarusian [[Polish landed gentry|landed gentry]]. His parents were Guilyar Frantsevich and Maryanna Yakauleuna Garausky. The family used the [[coat of arms]] "Korab" (since the 17th century) and traced its [[bloodline]] to the Belarusian [[Polish landed gentry|nobleman]] Grakala-Garausky (in the 19th century the first part of the surname Grakala fell into disuse). The artist's father Guilyar Garausky inherited the land (about 200 ha) from his father and grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;РГИА. ― Ф. 1343. ― Оп. 19. ― Д. 3065 ; РГВИА. ― Ф. 400. ― Оп. 12. ― Д. 18689 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; In the family, there were three daughters and the sons Ipalit (1828 ― after 1864), Apalinar (Apollinary) (1833―1900), Karl (1838 ― after 1869), Hektar (1843―1893), Guilyar (1847 ― after 1875). Karl and Hektar were professional servicemen, Ipalit, Apalinar and Guilyar ― artists.&lt;ref&gt;Апалінар Гараўскі = Аполлинарий Горавский = Apalinar Garausky. Минск : Беларусь, 2014. ― {{ISBN|978-985-01-1111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ГоравскийГоравский Вечер в Минской губернии 1870-е.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Evening in Minsk (1870s)]]
Apollinary, at ten, was sent to serve in the [[Brest-Litovsk]] Cadet Corps.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[http://www.kimpress.by/index.phtml?page=2&amp;DomainName=hbvmxuldokgq&amp;id=4919 Kultura], Biography and appreciation by Boris Krepak&lt;/ref&gt; Cadets studied general subjects of the classical school curriculum, such as languages, natural and social sciences. They were taught military disciplines, marching drill, riding, shooting, fencing, gymnastics, swimming, and also music and dance, drawing and painting. Apollinary had no inclination for military affairs, but liked drawing and painting. The architect [[Nicholas Benois]], who was visiting Goravsky's uncle (Chief of the Cadet Corps), took notice of Apollinary's works and later helped him enroll at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], where he studied with [[Maxim Vorobiev]] and [[Fyodor Bruni]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He graduated in 1854 with a gold medal. From 1855 to 1860 he travelled and painted throughout Europe, visiting Geneva, Paris and Rome and stopping in [[Düsseldorf]] to study with [[Andreas Achenbach]]. During this trip, he met [[Pavel Tretyakov]] and began a collaboration that would later be very beneficial to his career. On his return to Saint Petersburg, he was awarded the title of "Academician".&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

In 1869, the Academy gave him a stipend of 300 [[ruble]]s annually to "complete his education" and produce paintings of folk-life in Belarus and Ukraine, a commission which he pursued diligently, despite the cold weather and rheumatism in his right leg.&lt;ref&gt;''Гiсторыя беларускага мастацтва'' (History of Belarusian Art) 6 vols., 1989 pgs.209—216&lt;/ref&gt; For twenty years (1865—1885), he occasionally taught drawing at the "Society for the Encouragement of the Arts", although he spent most of his time in Belarus at his estate near Kirilovich.

Apollinary Goravsky died suddenly on March 28, 1900 at the Mariinsky Hospital in [[St. Petersburg]] at the age of 67. The death was reported in ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (New Times) and ''[[Istorichesky Vestnik]]'' (Historical Herald) magazines. The artist was buried at [[Vyborg]] [[cemetery]].

His widow, Alexandra, remained without maintenance with daughters, Marya and Yulia, and started selling the artist's works in the 1900s.

The greater part of the works of Apollinary Goravsky are exhibited in the [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]].

In 2009, Belarus issued a stamp featuring his painting "Evening in Minsk".

==Work==

===Overview===
''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' consists of a website that hosts a video, an introductory text and an open comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; Its existence was made public by a [[Facebook]] post from the video's director, [[Ted Lawson]].&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz says they had the idea for the piece in December 2014, and that performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] put them in touch with Lawson to direct it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; Lawson told ''ArtNet'' that he thought the piece was "super risky" and courageous.&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz stressed that it was a separate piece from ''Mattress Performance''.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

Sulkowicz wrote the script and introductory text, chose the position of the cameras, the lighting and the appearance of it having been filmed by security cameras. The scene was filmed in one continuous take three times during the Columbia spring break in March 2015.&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; According to Lawson, Sulkowicz had "insisted on it being completely real.&amp;nbsp;... That's what makes it a performance art piece."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz told the ''Guardian'' that making the video had been traumatizing, and had left them in a "very scared, emotional state for days."&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; They said elsewhere that vulnerability is part of what makes performance art good.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

===Text===
The introductory text said that the video was not an enactment of Sulkowicz's rape allegation. Rather, "''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol''&amp;nbsp;... [is] about your decisions, starting now." Sulkowicz gives only provisional consent to view the video:&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alter5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable.{{paragraph break}} You might be wondering why I've made myself this vulnerable. Look—I want to change the world, and that begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn't resist the urge to make ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' about what you wanted to make it about: rape.{{paragraph break}} Please, don't participate in my rape. Watch kindly.&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015&gt;Lauren Gambino, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/columbia-graduate-mattress-emma-sulkowicz-video/ "Columbia graduate who carried mattress releases video depicting 'rape'"], ''The Guargian'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They then ask a series of questions: "Are you searching for ways to either hurt or help me?&amp;nbsp;... Do you think I'm the perfect victim or the world's worst victim?&amp;nbsp;... Do you hate me? If so, how does it feel to hate me?"&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015/&gt;

===Video===
The scene is shown on a split screen from four angles, with a [[timestamp]] in each corner, beginning 02:10 and ending 02:18. Lawson said the security-camera perspective "removes the wall between the viewer and the action."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015&gt;Teo Armus, [http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2015/06/05/sulkowicz-films-herself-violent-sex-scene-newest-art-project "Sulkowicz films herself in a violent sex scene for newest art project"], ''Columbia Spectator'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; The video begins with Sulkowicz and the actor, whose face is blurred, entering the room, undressing each other, then kissing and engaging in [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[vaginal sex]], the latter with a condom. Three minutes into the video, the actor hits Sulkowicz several times, then removes the condom, pushes his hands and their legs against their neck or throat, and penetrates them anally. They scream, tells him to stop, and put their hand over their face. After a short time, the actor stops abruptly and leaves the room with his clothes in his hands. Sulkowicz is left curled on the bed in the [[fetal position]], with their back to the camera. After wrapping themselves in a towel, they briefly leave the room, return and make their bed, then appears to fall asleep.&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

Lawson told the ''Columbia Spectator'' that Sulkowicz and the actor had captured the shift from the consensual to non-consensual: "I think the video expresses the possibility that you don't forfeit that [consensuality] ever."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

===Public comments===
Lawson said ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' explores the relationship between art and social media, "this giant, polluted ocean."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; A key part of the work was the online reaction, particularly in the website's comments section. The 2,700 comments within the first five days were mostly critical or ridiculing. They included sexual, sexist and racist insults and threats. There were remarks about Sulkowicz's physical appearance, ethnicity, mental health, and that the scene did not depict rape.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015&gt;[[Suzannah Weiss]], [http://www.bustle.com/articles/88974-emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-site-was-temporarily-disabled-by-cyberattacks-but-her-opponents "Emma Sulkowicz's 'Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol' Site Was Temporarily Disabled By Cyberattacks, But Her Opponents Are Missing The Point"], ''Bustle'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monro9June2015&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/hackers-disable-emma-sulkowicz-website-censor-new-artwork-306593 "Hackers Disable Emma Sulkowicz Website to Censor New Artwork"], ''ArtNet'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Chan, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anti-rape-activist-emma-sulkowicz-releases-sex-video-art-article-1.2247676 "Columbia University anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz releases sex video as newest art piece"], ''New York Daily News'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Someone posted the video on a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; Comments on other sites were both positive and negative.&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt; The video was the victim of a denial-of-service attack by hackers on 4 June, according to [[DigitalOcean]], which hosts the site, and on 5 June there were technical problems caused by the numbers attempting to access it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt;

==Analysis==
''Newsweek'' called the video a "harrowing document," while Priscilla Frank in ''The Huffington Post'' described it as "simple yet stinging, providing imagery that lingers like a nightmare, never quite comprehensible but impossible to forget."&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mejia, [http://www.newsweek.com/columbia-university-mattress-protester-releases-video-addressing-rape-340372 "Columbia University Mattress Protester Releases Video Addressing Rape"], ''Newsweek'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the German edition of ''The Huffington Post'', Benjamin Prüfer was less positive, calling it an "art video that can only be described as pornography."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Prüfer, [http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/06/10/emma-sulkowicz-vergewalti_n_7558522.html "Kunst oder krank? Angebliches Vergewaltigungsopfer dreht verstörendes Sex-Video"]. ''The Huffington Post'', 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah Rubin, writing in ''The Forward'', called it "sophisticated and brilliant," and despaired of the lack of empathy on display in the website's comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; According to [[Julie Zeilinger]], the video was "unsettling" for Sulkowicz's supporters, and several questioned their approach.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Zeilinger, [http://mic.com/articles/120302/emma-sulkowicz-isn-t-the-only-artist-taking-on-sexual-assault-here-are-5-others "Emma Sulkowicz Isn't the Only Artist Taking on Sexual Assault. Here Are 5 Others"], 'Identities.Mic'', 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Slate's'' DoubleX Gabfest podcast, [[Hanna Rosin]] argued that the split-screen forces the viewer to embrace the subjective, in terms of choosing whether and how to watch, and how to interpret, which is the opposite of activism because it is too nuanced. The broadcast noted that Sandra Leong, Sulkowicz's mother, had written on Facebook in support of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, Noreen Malone and June Thomas, [http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/doublex_gabfest/2015/06/doublex_gabfest_on_emma_sulkowicz_radical_feminism_versus_caitlyn_jenner.html "DoubleX Gabfest: The Triple X Edition"], ''Slate'', 11 June 2015, from c. 09:00 mins; c 18:00 for Sandra Leong.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzannah Weiss]] wrote in ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' that Sulkowicz's provisional consent to watch the video is a metaphor for sexual consent. The video is there to watch, but the viewer has a decision to make. No one has consent to watch with hostility or if they are unsure of the artist's desires. No one has consent to post it to a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; If the artist's terms are disregarded, the viewing is non-consensual. Rebecca Brink argued in ''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]'' that, as well as illustrating the nature of sexual consent, ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' challenges the position that art, once made public, is removed from the artist's control and is for the viewer alone to interpret.&lt;ref name=Brink5June2015&gt;Rebecca Brink, [http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-06-05/emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-an-explainer "Emma Sulkowicz's “Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol”: An Explainer"], ''The Frisky'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[non-fiction]] [[book]], a '''conclusion''' is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing.  This generally follows the body or perhaps an [[afterword]], and the conclusion may be followed by an [[epilogue]], [[outro (book)|outro]], [[postscript]], appendix/[[Addendum#In books|addendum]], [[glossary]], [[bibliography]], [[index (publishing)|index]], [[erratum|errata]], or a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. [[Aristotle]], in ''The Rhetoric'', tells us a good writer should do this in the conclusion: "make the audience well-disposed towards ourselves and ill-disposed to our opponent." It's a good opportunity to make inferences or predictions, or to ask the audience to consider what would happen if they do not accept our point of view by making a connection to society in general.

'''Early Christian art and architecture''' or '''Paleochristian art''' is the art produced by [[Christian]]s or under Christian patronage from the [[Early Christianity|earliest period]] of [[Christianity]] to, depending on the definition used, sometime between 260 and 525. In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}} After 550 at the latest, Christian art is classified as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], or of some other regional type.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}}&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, F., 27 uses "roughly from 200 to 600".&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to know when distinctly [[Christian art]] began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity was largely a [[religion]] of the lower classes in this period,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for [[patronage]], and simply small numbers of followers. The [[Old Testament]] restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also [[Idolatry and Christianity]]) may also have [[aniconism in Christianity|constrained Christians from producing art]]. Christians may have made or purchased art with [[paganism|pagan]] [[iconography]], but given it Christian meanings, as they later did.  If this happened, "Christian" art would not be immediately recognizable as such.

Early Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included [[fresco]], [[mosaic]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. Early Christian art not only used [[Roman architecture|Roman]] forms, it also used Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], which include most examples of the earliest Christian art.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–14}}{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=30-32}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=12-15}}

Early Christian art and architecture adapted [[Roman art|Roman]] artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the [[peacock]], [[grape]]vines, and the "[[Good Shepherd]]". Early Christians also developed their own [[iconography]], for example, such symbols as the fish (''[[ikhthus]]''), were not borrowed from pagan iconography.

Early Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, bringing the so-called [[Triumph of the Church]] under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], or the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.  The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or [[Ante-Nicene Period]] and after being the period of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]].{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=16}} The end of the period of early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5th–7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313–325.

During the [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire]], Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian [[tomb]]s in the [[catacombs of Rome]].  From literary evidence, there may well have been panel [[icon]]s which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared.  Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by [[pictogram]] symbols such as the ''[[Ichthys]]'' (fish), [[peacock]], [[Lamb of God]], or an anchor (the ''[[Labarum]]'' or ''Chi-Rho'' was a later development).  Later personified symbols were used, including [[Jonah]], whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion's den, or [[Orpheus]]' charming the animals. The image of "[[The Good Shepherd (religion)|The Good Shepherd]]", a beardless youth in [[pastoral]] scenes collecting [[sheep]], was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=21-23}} These images bear some resemblance to depictions of ''kouros'' figures in Greco-Roman art.  The "almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned [[cross]]" except in the disguised form of the anchor,&lt;ref&gt;Marucchi, Orazio. "Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 Sept. 2018 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; is notable.  The Cross, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians from very early on.

The popular conception that the Christian catacombs were "secret" or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known.  The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=22}}

The dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, "the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image" (a marble relief carved c. 400 CE in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an [[empty throne]] representing God, in the throne are a ''[[chlamys]]'' (cloak) and [[diadem]] representing the Son.  The [[Chi-Rho]] monogram, XP, apparently first used by [[Constantine I]], consists of the first two characters of the name 'Christos' in Greek.

A general assumption that [[Aniconism in Christianity#Early Christianity|early Christianity was generally aniconic]], opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994).  This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen".  These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii–xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Finney suggests that "the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art".&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230–256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].  The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360}}&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134,  Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Christian paintings in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing [[orant]]s or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history.

The style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following [[Ancient Roman religion]], or Jews or followers of the [[Roman mystery religion]]s.  The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main ''corpus'' of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=29-30}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=24}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=23–24}} A similar situation applies at [[Dura-Europos]], where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the cattacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them,  with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–11}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=10-15}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 183, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 377}} though less often from this pre-Constantinian period.

There was a preference for what are sometimes called "abbreviated" representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below).{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}  Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], through [[typology (theology)|typology]], and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. [[Jonah and the whale]],{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 365}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 41 and chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]], [[Noah]] praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), [[Moses]] striking the rock, [[Daniel in the lion's den]] and the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace]] ({{Bibleref2c|Daniel|3:10–30|NIV|Daniel 3:10–30}}) were all favourites, that could be easily depicted.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=15-18}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=Chapte 3}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360-407}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=21-24}}

[[Early Christian sarcophagi]] were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very [[high relief]], worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the [[Good Shepherd]] were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them.  Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 362-367}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}} and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey.  The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=410}}

The [[depiction of Jesus]] was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for [[New Testament]] miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion.  A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short-haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger).

Saints are fairly often seen, with [[saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription.  In the same way some images may represent either the [[Last Supper]] or a contemporary [[agape feast]].

==Christian architecture after 313==
[[File:Santa Sabina.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Sabina]], Rome, interior (5th century).]]
:Main article: '''''Christianising the basilica''''' in '''''[[Basilica]]'''''

In the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=39}} Elsewhere this happened sooner.  Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop.

The usable model at hand, when [[Constantine I (emperor)|Emperor Constantine I]] wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the [[basilica]].  There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an [[apse]] at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated.  In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=40}} This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in [[Milan]].  All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian [[church architecture]]. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in [[Byzantine architecture]], which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter II, covers the whole story of the Christianization of the basilica.}}

A particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the '''funerary hall''', which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb.  The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]], the older basilica dedicated to [[Saint Agnes]] of which [[Santa Costanza]] is now the only remaining element, [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]], [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano]], and one in the modern park of [[Villa Gordiani]].&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Matilda. ''The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide'', p. 251, 2001, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|1-902210-58-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-902210-58-2}}, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUN1K78QMskC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=santa+costanza+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g2NRTvayJMzD8QOjwNyvBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=santa%20costanza%20rome&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Martyrium (architecture)|martyrium]] was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them.  With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter III}}

==Christian art after 313==
[[File:1057 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Detail - cast of the central sections of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], with ''[[Traditio Legis]]'' and ''Jesus entering Jerusalem''.]]
With the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character.  Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients.

Although borrowings of motifs such as the [[Virgin and Child]] from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[John Calvin]] and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of [[André Grabar]], [[Andreas Alföldi]], [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence "has become universally accepted".  A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;The book was ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'' by Thomas F. Mathews. Review by: W. Eugene Kleinbauer (quoted, from p. 937), ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]; JSTOR has other reviews, all with criticisms along similar lines: [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 77, No. 3 (Sep., 1995), pp. 499–502;  RW. Eugene Kleinbauer, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937–941 ,  Liz James, ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 136, No. 1096 (Jul., 1994), pp. 458–459;Annabel Wharton, ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 100, No. 5 (Dec., 1995), pp. 1518–1519 .&lt;/ref&gt;

More complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed.  Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jesusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. [[Mosaic]] now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than [[fresco]], although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens.  By the end of the period the style of gold background had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many [[Early Medieval]] Western ones.

With more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th-century examples are the set of [[Old Testament]] scenes along the nave walls of  [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.  These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=52-54}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=366-369}} The large [[apse]]s contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church.

No panel paintings, or "[[icon]]s" from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period.

Sculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities.  The most famous of a considerable number of surviving [[early Christian sarcophagi]] are perhaps the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] and [[Dogmatic sarcophagus]] of the 4th century.  A number of [[ivory carving]]s have survived, including the complex late-5th-century [[Brescia Casket]], probably a product of Saint [[Ambrose]]'s episcopate in [[Milan]], then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th-century [[Throne of Maximian]] from the Byzantine Italian capital of [[Ravenna]].

===Gold glass===
{{main article|Gold glass}}
[[Gold sandwich glass]] or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=25-26}} Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed).  The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

Accessed on February 1, 2010. http://www.douglasdavid.com/bio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to his mural ''Ebb and Flow'' Douglas states: "As I paint simple subjects that remind us of the romance of everyday life, I have designed a very simple flowing landscape. It will focus on a breathtaking sky and a flowing pasture. I feel it is a wonderful depiction of the Midwest and captures the essence of Indiana and its natural beauty. As it will literally flow from panel to panel with the grace of the wind, I am naming it Ebb and Flow." &lt;ref&gt;''Project Detail: Ebb and Flow'' Public Art Indianapolis. Accessed on February 1, 2010. http://www.publicartindianapolis.org/project_detail.aspx?id=20&amp;active=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location history==
Painted on location by the artist, ''Ebb and Flow'' is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis on N. Pennsylvania St. An un-used storefront, the building provides an excellent canvas for passers-by in cars or on foot.

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Paul]] Writing His Epistles'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]] or [[Nicolas Tournier]] (c. 16th century, Blaffer Foundation Collection, Houston, TX).]]

An '''epistle''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|əl}}; {{lang-el|ἐπιστολή}}, ''epistolē,'' "letter") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal [[Didacticism|didactic]] letter.  The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[Scribe|scribal-school]] writing curriculum. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as [[General epistles|catholic (i.e., "general") epistles]].

==Ancient Argon epistles==
The [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptians]] wrote epistles, most often for [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] reasons. [[Egyptologist]] Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Djedkare Isesi]]—in his many letters sent to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]]—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre.&lt;ref name=wente&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters from Ancient Egypt: Society of Biblical Literature Writing from the Ancient World Series Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn=978-1555404734|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.02262.0001.001|author=Edward F. Wente|translator = Edmund S. Meltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence is firmly attested during the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and is prominently featured in the educational guide ''The Book of Kemit'' written during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=wente/&gt; A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. The epistolary formulae used in the [[Ramesside Period]] found its roots in the letters composed during the [[Amarna Period]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. Wente describes the "Satirical Letter" found on the [[Papyrus Anastasi&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic [[ostraca]] (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greek]] domination.&lt;ref name=wente/&gt;

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and particularly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The letters of [[Cicero]] are one of the most important sources on the history of the late [[Roman Republic]] and preserve features of colloquial [[Latin]] not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. [[Ovid]] produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s: the ''[[Heroides]]'', letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Ex Ponto]]'', written in first person during the poet's [[Ovid#Exile to Tomis|exile]]. The epistles of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later [[Church Fathers|patristic]] writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Epistles are written in strict accordance to formalized, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tradition, especially the [[Pauline epistles]]. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers. Any deviancy is not the result of accident but indicates an unusual motive of the writer.

===Opening===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see [[Philippians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%201:1;&amp;version=31; 1:1]). The scribe (or more correctly, the [[amanuensis]]) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the ''episte'' (e.g., [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016:22;&amp;version=31; 16:22]). In the absence of a [[postal system]], the [[courier]] may also be named (e.g. [[Ephesians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%206:21-22;&amp;version=31; 6:21–22]).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you." "Grace" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while "peace" ([[shalom]]) was the common [[Judaism|Jewish]] greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

===Body===
The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the [[New Testament]] canon are usually divided as follows:

===Pauline Epistles===

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the [[New Testament]]. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word "epistle" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus "epistle" lends additional weight of authority.

==Liturgical use==&lt;!-- Epistle (liturgy) redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Epistle to Galatians Illuminatad.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Epistle to the Galatians, [[illuminated manuscript]] for reading during [[Christian liturgy]].]]
In the context of a [[liturgy]], epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the [[General epistles]])—sometimes also from the [[Book of Acts]] or the [[Revelation of John]], but not the [[Four Gospels]]—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[Eucharist]], epistles are read between the [[Collect]] and the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] reading. The corresponding [[Gregorian chant]]s have a special tone (''tonus epistolae''). When the epistle is sung or chanted at [[Solemn Mass]] it is done so by the [[subdeacon]]. Epistles are also read by an [[Elder (Christianity)#Lutheranism|Elder]] or [[Bishop#Lutheranism|Bishop]] in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], between the [[gradual]] and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Kniga Apostol 1632 Drukarnya S Sobal.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kniga Apostol'' (1632), [[lectionary]] in [[Church Slavonic]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]
In the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic]]s the Epistle reading is called the ''Apostol'' (the same name is given to the [[lectionary]] from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the [[Apocalypse]] (Revelation of John).  Unlike the [[Latin Rite]] there are never readings from the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Apostle (in Liturgy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Epistle [[lection|lessons]] for every day of the year, except for weekdays during [[Great Lent]], when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the [[Paschal cycle]], being ultimately dependent upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the [[feast day]]s of numerous [[saint]]s and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the [[Prokeimenon]] and the [[Alleluia]]. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the [[Gospel]], though some services, such as [[Matins]], will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle. A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]], though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a [[bishop]]), it is read by a [[deacon]]. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the [[Prokeimenon]].'''

==Medieval Epistles==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the [[ars dictaminis]] became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] system in the early [[Middle Ages]], factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Malcolm |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 52–66 |chapter= The ''Art dictaminis'', the Formulary, and Medieval Epistolary Practice |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's ''lingua franca'', [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poster |first1=Carol |last2=Utz |first2=Richard |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 285–300 |chapter= Appendix&amp;nbsp;B: A Bibliography of Medieval Latin ''Dictamen'' |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag of Kirkcudbrightshire''' is the flag of the [[Kirkcudbrightshire|county and stewartry of Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Flag Institute|Kirkcudbrightshire}} The Flag Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered with the Flag Institute as the flag of the county in June 2016 after the Lord Lieutenant petitioned the [[Lord Lyon]].

==Design==
The green and white emblem represents the checked cloth used to count taxes by the Stewards of the [[Lord of Galloway|Lords of Galloway]] with the [[Cuthbert|St Cuthbert]]'s cross sitting on top. The town and county of Kirkcudbright were named after the saint, with an early rendition of the name being Kilcudbrit, derived from the Scots Gaelic ''Cille Chuithbeirt'' (Chapel of Cuthbert). The Anglo-Saxon saint's remains were kept here for seven years between exhumation at [[Lindisfarne]] and re-interment at [[Chester-le-Street]]. A pectoral cross was found on the saint’s body when his tomb was opened in the nineteenth century. The original is on display in [[Durham Cathedral]] where he was eventually buried. That cross is also depicted on the [[flag of County Durham]].

A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82326.stm |title=Green Paper |publisher=BBC News | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green papers may result in the production of a [[white paper]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]].

==Canada==
A green paper in [[Canada]], like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted [[legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/green-paper |title=Green Paper |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/green-papers/ |title=Green Papers |publisher=The UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careandsupportreform/what-green-paper|title=What is a Green Paper?|date=2009-06-18|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
A green paper released by the [[European Commission]] is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of [[defence policy]] in [[Australia]] culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on [[copyright]] was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the "[[knowledge economy]]" and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf this document]). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.

The '''Housewares Design Awards''' is an annual U. S. product design award competition focused on the [[Household goods|housewares industry]]. The competition was introduced in 2003 by ''HomeWorld Business'', a leading housewares industry [[trade publication]], to recognize design innovation as one of the major drivers for housewares industry growth. 
 
The Housewares Design Awards attracts hundreds of product entries each year. These entries are evaluated by an independent panel of judges made up of renowned designers and retailer buyers, a process managed by the Housewares Design Awards LLC. Products are evaluated along multiple dimensions. Criteria include unique appearance, functionality, positioning, innovative technology or materials, safety, environmental benefits, emotional appeal, social impact and the ability to meet consumer needs.

Twelve “Best in Category” Awards and three “Best of the Best” awards are presented at the gold, silver and bronze levels. The “Green House Design Awards,” which honor eco-friendly housewares products, are also given each year.

'''''Le livre des sauvages au point de vue de la civilization''''' was a 19th century hoax manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/10-fake-antiques8.htm|title=10 Famous Fake Antiques and the Suckers Who Bought Them|date=8 April 2013|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French missionary [[Emmanuel Domenech]]'s work ''Manuscrit pictographique américain, précédé d'une notice sur l'idéographie des Peaux Rouges'' (Paris, 1860) was the result of an unintentional hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_pictographs_of_emmanuel_domenech|title=The Pictographs of Emmanuel Domenech|website=museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German orientalist Julius Petzholdt declared that the manuscript consisted only of scribbling and incoherent illustrations in a local German dialect. Domenech maintained the authenticity of the manuscript in a pamphlet entitled ''La vérité sur le livre des sauvages'' (1861), which drew forth a reply from Petzholdt, translated into French (by [[:fr:Philippe Van der Haeghen|Philippe Van der Haeghen]]) under the title of ''Le livre des sauvages au point de vue de la civilization Française'' (Brussels, 1861).

[[Image:Birmingham Central Library fire jan1879.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Birmingham Central Library]] destroyed by fire, 1879]]
Libraries have been deliberately or accidentally destroyed or badly damaged. Sometimes a [[library]] is purposely destroyed as a form of [[cultural cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fadhil|first=Muna|date=26 February 2015|title=Isis destroys thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul libraries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/26/isis-destroys-thousands-books-libraries|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of accidentally destroyed libraries by human actions. Other times they are damaged by natural disasters like earthquakes, floods or accidental fires.

Library fires have happened sporadically through the centuries: notable examples are the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]], destruction of Library of Nalanda in India and the accidental burning of the [[Duchess Anna Amalia Library]] in Weimar. Causes vary from [[arson]] to the [[sun]]'s rays setting fire to leaflets through the action of a magnifying lens, as happened to a library in [[Northam, Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=The Times |location=London |title=Arson ruled out |date=17 June 2005 |page=38 |department=Home News |edition=Final 3|quote=A fire that destroyed a public library in Northam, Devon, was thought to have been the work of an arsonist, but investigators have determined that a beam from a hands-free magnifier ignited leaflets, which fell onto a box of books. Flames destroyed 90 per cent of the collection.&lt;!-- This is the entirety of the story. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://fred.historicengland.org.uk/pdf/743.pdf|title=Action C17: Built Heritage: Fire Loss to Historic Buildings: Final Report|author=TECHNICAL CONSERVATION, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION group|publisher=Historic Scotland|date=2007|isbn=978-1-904966-53-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and prevention ==
In earlier times [[mildew]] was considered a major problem in many libraries and so the emphasis on library design was to increase air flow by, for example, leaving openings under the shelves in adjoining floors. In a fire the flames will be drawn floor to floor by the air flow thus ensuring the relatively easy destruction of a whole library rather than a small section.

Advances in technology have reduced the possibility of a library collection being destroyed by fire. These include water sprinklers, [[fire door]]s, freezers, alarms, smoke detectors, suppression systems, and emergency generators. Older libraries are usually converted by closing up air flow openings and installing fire doors, alarms and sprinklers. Air conditioning reduces the mold problems. These are all essential parts of new library design.

There is no recovery possible if a book is burnt so it is accepted that a better solution is to put out the fire with water and then dry out the books. As mold destroys paper the books are frozen until they can be dried. This process will damage the book but not destroy it and the information will be intact.

In order to minimize the possibility of damage from fire, or other causes, and decrease the time needed for recovery after a destructive event, all libraries need a disaster management and recovery plan. This can be an ongoing process which will include professional development following updates in technology for key staff, training for the remaining staff, checking and maintaining disaster kits, and review of the disaster plan.

In addition, fire-safety investigations are periodically carried out, especially regarding historical libraries.  The [[Library of Congress]], for example, experienced a year-long inspection in 2000. Before the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]], the Library of Congress and all Capitol Hill buildings were exempt from safety regulations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fineberg, Gail. "Moving Toward a Safer Library. Compliance Office Issues Fire Safety Report," Library of Congress Information Bulletin 60 no. 3, 65, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Balancing historical preservation and contemporary safety standards proves to be a difficult task for "even a 12-year rehabilitation of LC completed in 1997 did not address many fire hazards".&lt;ref&gt;L.A., "Inspection Scorches Fire Safety at LC," ''American Libraries,'' 32 no. 3 17–18, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Compliance Office inspection, however, the LC announced their wholehearted commitment "to achieving the highest level of safety possible" and "the [[Architect of the Capitol]] and Library of Congress will report their progress to the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]] every three months".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Information technology is another catalyst for careful fire protection.  With so many computers in libraries there "is a decrease in floor space and an increase in more compact and powerful computer systems" which generates more heat and requires the use of many more outlets, increasing the number of potential ignition sources.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"&gt;Fixen, Edward L. and Vidar S. Landa,"Avoiding the Smell of Burning Data," ''Consulting-Specifying Engineer'', May 2006, Vol. 39 Issue 5, p47-51&lt;/ref&gt;  From as early as the 1950s the potential dangers of computer equipment, and the facilities that house them, was recognized.  Thus in 1962 the National Fire Protection Association began developing the first safety standards specifically applicable to electronic computer systems.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"/&gt;  This standard is called NFPA 75 Protection of Information Technology Equipment.  FM Global Data Sheet 5–32 is another standard providing guidelines to protect against not only fire, but water, power loss, etc.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"/&gt;

[[File:Bronze Age 'lock-ring' (FindID 269841).jpg|thumb|A lock ring found in Buckinghamshire]]
A '''lock ring''' is the name given by [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[jewellery]] from [[Bronze Age]] [[Europe]].

They are made from gold or bronze and are penannular, providing a slot that is thought to have been used for attaching them as earrings or as hair ornaments. [[Ireland]] was a centre of production in the [[British Isles]] though rings were made and used across the continent, notably by the [[Unetice culture]] of [[Central Europe]].

The technology at the time used a slot in the metal to lock the ring to a jewel. Other features included a decorated face plate and a triangular cross-section. Lock rings have been found in modern-day Ireland, France, and Great Britain. Gold was used for the majority of lock rings that have been found, though other artifacts constructed out of bronze, or clay, gold and bronze composite have been found.

'''''Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God''''' is a [[monodrama]] written by [[Charles Messina]] about the life and death of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]].  It presents Mercury in the moments just after his death, during which he is confronted with self-examination as he "seeks redemption before a God unimpressed by his celebrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messina|first=Charles|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|year=2009|publisher=Original Works Publishing|location=United States|isbn=978-1-934962-52-7|pages=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Farrokh Bulsara was a boy of Persian heritage who never quite fit into his skin or his teeth.  It wasn’t until he became a young man that he discovered his talent and true nature, and was reborn as Freddie Mercury.  After a brilliant career, with the arenas empty and the lights out, on the night of November 24, 1991, Freddie is forced to surrender his celebrity and face the frailty of his own humanity.  As he succumbs to AIDS, the worldwide icon seeks redemption before a God unimpressed with celebrity. In his ultimate struggle to make sense of his grim fate, Mercury realizes that his fame, fortune, and talents are no longer enough to sustain him; that beyond the darkness of his fears, shines a light far brighter than the star he was on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originalworksonline.com/store/monologues/mercury-the-afterlife-and-times-of-a-rock-god/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ran every night until December 7.

== Second run ==

The play began its second run on February 14, 1998.

On February 17, rock musician [[Billy Squier]], a longtime friend of Freddie's, debuted a song that he wrote in memory of him titled ''I Have Watched You Fly'' on stage before a performance of the play.  He introduced the song by saying, "I knew Freddie as a friend.  I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was also performed every night during the second run, ending on March 8, 1998.

Proceeds from the ticket sales of both runs were donated to [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] and [[Mercury Phoenix Trust|The Mercury Phoenix Trust]].&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"/&gt;

On January 11, 2004, the play experienced a successful revival with a three-month run at the [[Triad Theater]], also in New York City, with Messina again as writer/director and featuring [[Amir Darvish]] in the role of Freddie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simonson|authorlink1=Robert Simonson |first=Robert |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Freddy Mercury Play Begins Performances Off Broadway, Jan. 11 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83716-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Freddy-Mercury-Play-Begins-Performances-Off-Broadway-Jan-11 |publisher=Playbill.com |date=January 11, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021131929/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83716-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Freddy-Mercury-Play-Begins-Performances-Off-Broadway-Jan-11 |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the play also had a special, limited engagement from August 30 to September 2 at The Art House in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God in Provincetown Art House August 30|url=http://provincetownjournal.com/events/entry/mercury-the-afterlife-and-times-of-a-rock-god-in-provincetown-art-house-aug/|publisher=ProvincetownJournal.com|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

In 2009, the play was published by Original Works Publishing.  Proceeds from the sale of the play will be donated to [[AmfAR|AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messina|first=Charles|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|year=2009|publisher=Original Works Publishing|location=United States|isbn=978-1-934962-52-7|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==

Both incarnations of the play have received favorable reviews from Queen fans and from the music and theater press, notably [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marone|first=Mark|title=On Stage|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=Goncalves&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#/archive/read?id=3gkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=frontcover&amp;query=1997&amp;date=1997-12-13|newspaper=Billboard|date=December 13, 1997|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Yorker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The New Yorker|date=January 26, 2004|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out New York]], [[Zagat Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zagat Survey New York City Theater Guide Spring Edition|year=2004|publisher=Zagat Survey|isbn=978-1-57006-587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Forbes|first=Harry|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|magazine=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|date=November 28, 2003|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4569275-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2011, the play was recognized by Flavorwire.com in their list of ''15 Artistic Tributes to Freddie Mercury.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Temple|first=Emily|title=The Show Must Go On: 15 Artistic Tributes to Freddie Mercury|url=http://flavorwire.com/235246/the-show-must-go-on-15-artistic-tributes-to-freddie-mercury/5|publisher=FlavorWire.com|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

There was no Queen or Freddie Mercury music in the play.

In a 1997 interview with [[Playbill.com]], Gonçalves said, "All the things I've seen about Mercury focus on the music, career and persona; very little has been discussed about the person. Not only did Charles write a play about Mercury, he captured the humanity." "Charles and I agreed that doing a musical about Mercury would take away from what we're trying to do in getting to the core of this person. The ultimate goal is to make a film of Mercury's life."&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"/&gt;

Likewise, Darvish, in a 2004 interview with [[Access Hollywood]], stated that, "We wanted to stray away from the music.  We wanted to tell his story.  He has a story.  Everyone knows the music.  People are familiar with the music.  It's his story, and where he's come from, and what he's done that people don't know.&lt;ref name="BBCPres2008"&gt;{{Cite episode

Knell Wellcome V0031505.jpg|thumb|''Saint Agnes'', mezzotint by [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]] after [[Godfrey Kneller]], usually thought to be a portrait of his daughter, Catherine Voss, by his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&amp;ItemID=756&amp;Desc=Catherine-Voss-as-St-Agnes-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-Bt. Portrait of Miss Voss as St Agnes 1690s]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
'''Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] process of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, technically a [[drypoint]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mezzotint|title=Definition of MEZZOTINT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Grayscale|tonal method]] to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like [[hatching]], cross-hatching or [[stipple]]. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker".  In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

==History==
[[Image:Ludwig von Siegen - Portrait of Amelie Elisabeth von Hessen.jpg|thumb|The first known mezzotint, by [[Ludwig von Siegen]], 1642]]
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–{{circa|1680}}). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of [[Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg]].  This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], a famous cavalry commander in the [[English Civil War]], who was the next to use the process, and took it to England.  Sir [[Peter Lely]] saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England.  [[Godfrey Kneller]] worked closely with [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]], who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings.  

The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings.  Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. [[Robert Kipniss]] and [[Peter Ilsted]] are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; [[M. C. Escher]] also made eight mezzotints.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]] of 1929, also spreading to America.  The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up.  The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait.  There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many "[[State (printmaking)|proof states]]" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on.  Leading collectors included [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]] and the Irishman [[John Chaloner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 134–137 and 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method.  The whole surface (usually) of a [[metal]], usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically.  If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate.  Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print "white," that is, without ink.  By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name ''mezzo-tinto'' which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[half-tone]]" or "half-painted".  This is called working from "dark to light", or the "subtractive" method.

==Light to dark method==
[[Image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. 27.5 &amp;times; 21.3 cm]]
Alternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be.  This is called working from "light to dark", or the "additive" method.  The first mezzotints by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out.  Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the [[copper]]. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

==Tone==
Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], ''burnisher'' and ''scraper'' allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

A '''nefesh''' (plural: ''nefashot'') is a [[Semitic people|Semitic]] monument placed near a grave so as to be seen from afar.

==Nabataea==

[[File:Obelisk Tomb and Triclinium.jpg|thumb|alt=Several nepheshes can be seen on this tomb.|Obelisk Tomb and Bab el-Siq Triclinium, [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
[[File:Nefesh at Petra, Jordan.JPG|thumb|Carving of a Nefesh on the rock face near Tomb 70, Petra]]
In a Nabataean [[votive]] [[inscription]] from [[Salkhad]], an [[Aramaic]] heap of stones set up in memorial is described as "for [[Allat]] and her ''wgr''", a term equated to the [[Hasaitic]] ''nephesh''. In [[Sabeans|Sabean]], this term could mean a [[tumulus]] above a tomb, while in [[Arabic]] this term could indicate a grotto or a tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001),83&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''nephesh'' is also linked to the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[stele]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bert de Vries, "'Be of good cheer!No one on earth is immortal':Religious Symbolism in Tomb Architecture and Epitaphs at the Umm el-Jimal and Tall Hisban Cemeteries,"in Douglas R. Clark et al, ed. ''The Madaba Plains Project: Forty Years of Archaeological Research in Jordan's Past.'' Equinox, 2011 803-805&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Aniconism|aniconic]] culture, the Nabataean representation of deities lacked figural imagery. Related to betyls, ''nepheshes'' served as aniconic [[memorial]] markers for the dead. Unlike the [[Israelites|Israelite]] prohibition of the graven image, Nabataean aniconism allows [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representation of deities but demonstrates a preference for non- figural imagery. [[Baetylus|Betyls]] are one form of Nabataean aniconic sculpture. Often explained as representations of [[Dushara]], the central Nabataean deity, betyls occur in a wide variety of shapes, groupings, and niches. This variety suggests that betyls may be representative of other deities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nabataean ''nephesh'' is a standing stone, [[obelisk]]oid in shape, often featuring a blossom/pinecone or stylized crown on the top. Roughly carved or engraved in [[bas-relief]], these structures are often set upon a base that bears the name of the deceased. Occurring outside and inside tombs,some are engraved near or in votive niches.However, many ''nepheseshes'' can be found unconnected from tombs, and many line the paths to [[Petra]] or along other protruding rock faces such as those of the [[Siq]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001),87-88&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of funerary marker can be found in the Obelisk Tomb and Bab el-Siq Triclinium, [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].

==Jerusalem==

Some examples of monumental funerary sculpture near Jerusalem bear inscriptions that include the term ''nephesh'', and the word is generally accepted as a reference to the pyramid structure above or beside the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Zias and Emile Puech, "The Tomb of Absalom Reconsidered," ''NearEastern Archeology',Wol.c68, No. 4 (Dec.,2005), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Absalom===

[[File:Tomb of Avshalom in the Kidron Valley;.jpg|thumb|[[Yad Avshalom]] in Kidron Valley]]
Standing among a group of tombs in [[Jerusalem]], the [[tomb of Absalom]] is an important example of [[Second Temple period|Late Second Temple]] funerary architecture. To the lower left of the entrance to the tomb, the word ''nephesh'' is inscribed in Greek. In this context, the Greek ''nephesh'' is translated as two Hebrew-Aramaic words as ''nephesh'' and ''qubr,'' now interpreted as an amalgam of "tomb" and "stele." The carved rock is thus a memorial that evokes the essence or spirit of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Zias and Emile Puech, "The Tomb of Absalom Reconsidered," ''NearEastern Archeology',Wol.c68, No. 4 (Dec.,2005), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jason's Tomb===

Dated to the first century BCE, [[Jason's Tomb]] bears an Aramaic inscription that states: "because I built for you a tomb (''nephesh'') and a memorial (''qubr''), be in peace in Jer[u]sa[le]m."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Puech,"Inscriptions funeraires pelestiniennes:tombeau de Jason et ossuaires.''Revue biblique'' 1983. 90:481-533&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Benei Hezir===

The [[Tomb of Benei Hezir]] also bears an epithet in Hebrew that states: "This is the tomb and the stele/memorial (''nephesh'') of [[Eleazar]]...".&lt;ref&gt;N. Avigad. ''Ancient Monuments in the Kidron Valley.'' Jerusalem:Israel Exploration Society. 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">'''Neo-Dada''' was a movement with [[audio art|audio]], [[visual art|visual]] and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier [[Dada]] artwork. In the United States the term was popularized by [[Barbara Rose]] in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, [[Neo-Dada Organizers|particularly in Japan]] and in Europe, serving as the foundation of [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Nouveau réalisme]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada was exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and [[Absurdism|absurd]]ist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of [[Abstract Expressionism]] and, taking a lead from the practice of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]], denied traditional concepts of [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Craft, pp.10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''The Dada Painters and Poets'' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yzchnw4YUlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Brill, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Young, ''Dada and After: Extremist Modernism and English Literature'', Manchester University 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-RXpAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PT96&amp;dq=neo-dada&amp;pg=RA4-PT96#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-dada&amp;f=false pp.201–3] and Brill, pp.104–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, [[Piero Manzoni]]'s  ''Consacrazione dell'arte dell'uovo sodo'' (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist's personal creation and art as commodity. 

[[File:Basel Fasnachtsbrunnen Jean Tinguely.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A Jean Tingueley fountain in Basel]]
An allied approach is found in the creation of [[collage]] and [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], as in the junk sculptures of the American [[Richard Stankiewicz]], whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters' practice. These objects are "so treated that they become less discarded than found, ''objets trouvés''."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater in ''A Dictionary of Modern Sculpture'', London 1962, pp.277–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tinguely]]'s fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing ''Homage to New York'' (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical.

Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] labeled as "combines" such works as "Bed" (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. [[Arman]] labeled as "accumulations" his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as "''poubelles''" the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. [[Daniel Spoerri]] created "snare pictures" (''tableaux piège''), of which the earliest was "Kichka's Breakfast" (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.

==Poems==
In the Netherlands the poets associated with the 'magazine for texts', ''Barbarber'' (1958–71), particularly [[J. Bernlef]] and [[K. Schippers]], extended the concept of the [[readymade]] into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Mourits, ''The Conceptual Poetic of K. Schippers: the aesthetic implications of literary readymades'', Dutch Crossing 21.1, pp.119–34&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine ''Gard Sivik'' and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager (1935–92), [[Hans Verhagen]] and the artist [[Armando (artist)|Armando]]. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that "the poet's role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non-poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers."&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Brems, ''Contemporary Poetry of the Low Countries'', Flemish Netherlands Foundation, 1995, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914–94), the theorist of the [[Zero (art)|Dutch Nul group]] of artists, to which Armando also belonged: "Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero."&lt;ref&gt;Translation in ''Dutch Interior: Postwar Poetry of the Netherlands and Flanders'', Columbia University 1984, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cPOqoSriyY0C&amp;lpg=PR36&amp;ots=BobxbkKkkC&amp;dq=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;pg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;f=false pp.36–7]&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau Réaliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism.

The beginnings of [[Concrete Poetry]] and text montage in the [[Wiener Gruppe]] have also been referred back to the example of [[Raoul Hausmann]]'s letter poems.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Katharina Schaffner, "How the Letters Learned to Dance: on language dissection in Dadaist, Digital and Concrete Poetry", in  Avant-garde/Neo-avant-garde, Amsterdam 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CttwTdwx04C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.149–165]&lt;/ref&gt; Such techniques may also owe something to [[H.N. Werkman]]'s typographical experiments in the Netherlands which had first been put on display in the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1945.

'''''Node Magazine''''' is a [[literature|literary]] project in the guise of a fictional magazine created to annotate the novel ''[[Spook Country]]'' by [[William Gibson]].

The project is essentially a [[hypertext]] version of the novel.&lt;ref name="now romancer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/08/11/william_gibson/index_np.html |title=Now Romancer |accessdate=2007-10-30 |last=Lim |first=Dennis |date=2007-08-11 |work=Salon Books |publisher=''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from ''Node'', a non-existent magazine in ''Spook Country'' owned by [[Hubertus Bigend]], which employs the novel's protagonist to pursue the source of [[locative art]].&lt;ref name="broome"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin |last=Broome |url=http://www.kevinbroome.com/2007/09/william-gibson-at-cbc-book-club.html |title=William Gibson at the CBC Book Club |accessdate=2007-10-30 |work=broome: ideas&amp;executions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720181720/http://www.kevinbroome.com/2007/09/william-gibson-at-cbc-book-club.html |archivedate=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scary"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Watson |title=William Gibson explores the science fiction of the here-and-now in his new novel |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/August/05/style/stories/05style.htm |work=Bookends |publisher=''[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]'' |date=2007-08-05 |accessdate=2007-10-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181430/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/August/05/style/stories/05style.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was initiated when the recipient of an [[Advance copy|advanced reading copy]] of the novel mobilised "an army of volunteers" to track the references and assemble the cloud of [[metadata|data]] surrounding the novel – every element of the work which is searchable on internet resources such as [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="node idea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Ann |last=Gwinn |title=Futuristic fantasy lives now for author William Gibson |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2003821831_gibson06.html?syndication=rss |work=Books |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudonymous author, under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' patternBoy, conceived the Node project as "a multi-author blog of fictional news stories in the ''Spook Country'' universe", and did not anticipate that it would itself become the focus of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://node.tumblr.com/post/7987295 |title=And Now, Towards Chapter 85... |accessdate=2007-10-30 |work=Node tumblr }}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared the launch of the Node [[tumblog]] sister-site to ''Node Magazine'' on June 24, 2007, with the following announcement:

{{quote|With 42 days before the official release and a total of 84 chapters, I will begin posting two short (under 807 characters each in celebration of the official release date) chapter summaries each day. Quotations will be very sparse and all posts will contain my interpretations (and likely significant spoilers) re: the yet-to-be-released work.&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://node.tumblr.com/post/4195863 |title=Countdown begins: 42 days, 84 chapters |accessdate=2007-10-30 |date=2007-06-24 |work=Node tumblog |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The project has precedent in Joe Clark's [http://fawny.org/pr/ PR-Otaku], an attempt at logging and annotating Gibson's preceding novel ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.&lt;ref name="pr-otaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodemagazine.com/2007/08/17/no-offense-intended/ |title=No Offense Intended… |accessdate=2007-10-30 |work=Node Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907125417/http://nodemagazine.com/2007/08/17/no-offense-intended/ |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has noted that while PR-Otaku "took a couple of years to come together", ''Node'' was complete before the novel was even published.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Garreau |author2=Meg Smith  |title=Through the Looking Glass |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502582_pf.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Sutherland credits the project as "giving an extraordinary reading of [the] novel in which everything is concretized – solidity and specification is added to [the] text."&lt;ref name="sflondon"&gt;{{cite interview

&lt;/ref&gt; He has conceived this as nothing less than a new form of hyper-[[annotation]]:

Gibson in turn has characterized the project as "a sort of little Wikipedia" for ''Spook Country,''&lt;ref name="silicon"/&gt; and has declared it to be "stunning," remarkably accurate, genuinely novel and "sort of scary."&lt;ref name="now romancer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflondon"/&gt; He has spoken of his newfound awareness when writing of "a ghostly cloud of [[hypertext]] hanging around the text of the manuscript," the alteration this has on the way readers experience the text, and the fact that all his research will be retraceable by readers of his work.&lt;ref name="sflondon"/&gt;

A '''panel painting''' is a painting made on a flat panel made of [[wood]], either a single piece, or a number of pieces joined together. Until [[canvas]] became the more popular support medium in the 16th century, it was the normal form of support for a painting not on a wall ([[fresco]]) or [[vellum]], which was used for [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings for the framing.

==History==
[[File:Fayum Portrait of a Boy (detail).jpg|thumb|left|Boy from [[Al-Fayum]], 2nd century CE (a [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portrait]]). Encaustic on wood—note the cracks.]]
Panel painting is very old; it was a very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from [[Pitsa panels|Pitsa]] ([[Greece]]) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works - perhaps up to a half-length portrait size.  However, for a generation in the second quarter of the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the "new painting" and led by [[Polygnotus]], for very large painted [[frieze]]s, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We can only attempt to imagine what these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 103-104 (illus. 105)&lt;/ref&gt;  The first century BC to third century AD [[Fayum mummy portraits]], preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman period]] - about 900 face or bust portraits survive.  The [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the [[Icon]]s of [[Byzantine art]] and the later [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, the earliest of which (all in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality.  [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] and [[tempera]] are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons.

Although there seem from literary references to have been some panel paintings produced in Western Europe through the centuries between [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, and Byzantine icons were imported, there are next to no survivals in an unaltered state.  In the 12th century panel painting experienced a revival because of new liturgical practices—the priest and congregation were now on the same side of the altar, leaving the space behind the altar free for the display of a holy image—and thus altar decorations were in demand. The earliest forms of panel painting were [[dossal]]s (altar backs), altar fronts and [[crucifixes]]. All were painted with religious images, commonly the Christ or the Virgin, with the saints appropriate to the dedication of the church, and the local town or diocese, or to the donor.  [[Donor portrait]]s including members of the donor's  family are also often shown, usually kneeling to the side.  They were for some time a cheaper alternative to the far more prestigious equivalents in metalwork, decorated with gems, [[Tooth enamel|enamel]]s, and perhaps ivory figures, most of which have long been broken up for their valuable materials.  Painted panels for altars are most numerous in Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], which is explained by the poverty of the country at this time, as well as the lack of Reformation [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th and 14th centuries in Italy were a great period of panel painting, mostly [[altarpiece]]s or other religious works. However, it is estimated that of all the panel paintings produced there, 99.9 percent have been lost.  The vast majority of [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s are on panel, and these include most of the earliest [[portrait]]s, such as those by [[Jan van Eyck]], and some other secular scenes.  However, one of the earliest surviving oils on [[canvas]] is a French ''Madonna with angels'' of about 1410 in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], which is very early indeed for oil painting also.  In these works the frame and panel are sometimes a single piece of wood, as with [[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)]] by van Eyck ([[National Gallery, London]]), where the frame was also painted, including an inscription done illusionistically to resemble carving.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 216&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Frankfurt]] ''[[Paradiesgärtlein]]'', a German panel painting from ''circa'' 1410]]

By the 15th century with the increased wealth of Europe, and later the appearance of humanism, and a changing attitude about the function of art and patronage, panel painting went in new directions. Secular art opened the way to the creation of chests, painted beds, birth trays and other furniture.  Many such works are now detached and hung framed on walls in museums.  Many double-sided wings of altarpieces (see picture at top) have also been sawn into two one-sided panels.

Canvas took over from panel in Italy by the first half of the 16th century, a change led by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and the artists of Venice (which made the finest canvas at this point, for sails).  In the [[Netherlands]] the change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe, even after the cheaper and more portable canvas had become the main support medium.  The young [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and many other painters preferred it for the greater precision that could be achieved with a totally solid support, and many of his most important works also used it, even for paintings over four metres long in one dimension.  His panels are of notoriously complicated construction, containing as many as seventeen pieces of wood (''Het Steen'', [[National Gallery, London]]).   For smaller [[cabinet painting]]s, copper sheets (often old [[printmaking]] plates) were another rival support, from the end of the 16th century, used by many artists including [[Adam Elsheimer]].  Many Dutch painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Golden Age]] used panel for their small works, including [[Rembrandt]] on occasion.  By the 18th century it had become unusual to paint on panel, except for small works to be inset into furniture, and the like.  But, for example, The National Gallery in London has two [[Goya]] portraits on panel.

Many other painting traditions also painted, and still paint, on wood, but the term is usually only used to refer to the Western tradition described above.

==Panel construction and preparation==
[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|Russian [[icon]] by [[Andrey Rublev]], early 15th century, on a three piece panel. The raised edges are probably gesso rather than wood]]
The technique is known to us through [[Cennino Cennini]]'s ''The Craftsman's Handbook'' (''Il libro dell' arte'') published in 1390, and other sources.  It changed little over the centuries.  It was a laborious and painstaking process:
*A carpenter would construct a solid wood piece the size of the panel needed. Usually a radial cut piece was preferred (across rather than along the length of the tree; the opposite of most timber cuts), with the outer sapwood excluded. In Italy it was usually seasoned poplar, willow or linden. It would be planed and sanded and if needed, joined with other pieces to obtain the desired size and shape.
*The wood would be coated with a mixture of animal-skin glues and resin and covered with linen (the mixture and linen combination was known as a "size"); this might be done by a specialist, or in the artists studio.
*Once the size had dried, layer upon layer of [[gesso]] would be applied, each layer sanded down before the next applied, sometimes as many as 15 layers, before a smooth hard surface emerged, not unlike ivory.  This stage was not necessarily done after the 16th century, or darker grounds were used.

==Painting techniques==
Once the panel construction was complete, the design was laid out, usually in charcoal.

The usual ancient painting technique was [[encaustic painting|encaustic]], used at Al-Fayum and in the earliest surviving Byzantine icons, which are at the Saint Catherine's Monastery. This uses heated wax as the medium for the pigments.

This was replaced before the end of first millennium by [[tempera]], which uses an egg-yolk medium.  Using small brushes dipped in a mixture of pigment and egg-yolk, the paint was applied in very small, almost transparent, brushstrokes. Thin layers of paint would be used to create volumetric forms.

By the beginning of the 15th century, [[oil painting]] was developed. This was more tolerant, and allowed the exceptional detail of Early Netherlandish art. This used a very painstaking multi-layered technique, where the painting, or a particular part of it, had to be left for a couple of days for one layer to dry before the next was applied.

==Conservation and scientific analysis==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 071.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with rainbow'' 94 x 123 cm, 1636-8. A large [[Rubens]] panel painting, with a panel made out of many pieces]]
Wood panels, especially if kept with too little humidity, often warp and crack with age, and from the 19th century, when reliable techniques were developed, many have been [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas or modern board supports]].

Wood panel is now rather more useful to art historians than canvas, and in recent decades there has been great progress in extracting this information - and many fakes discovered and mistaken datings corrected.  Specialists can identify the tree species used, which varied according to the area where the painting was made.  [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-dating]] techniques can give an approximate date-range (typically to about a range of about 20 years), and [[dendrochronology]] sequences have been developed for the main source areas of timber for panels.  Italian paintings used local or sometimes [[Dalmatia]]n wood, most often [[Populus|poplar]], but including [[chestnut]], [[walnut]], [[oak]] and other woods.  The Netherlands ran short of local timber early in the 15th century, and most Early Netherlandish masterpieces are Baltic [[oak]], often [[Poland|Polish]], cut north of [[Warsaw]] and shipped down the [[Vistula]], across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Southern German painters often used [[pine]], and [[mahogany]] imported into Europe was used by later painters, including examples by [[Rembrandt]] and Goya.

In theory, dendro-chronology gives an exact felling date, but in practice allowances have to be made for a seasoning period of several years, and a small panel may be from the centre of the tree, with no way of knowing how many rings outside the panel there were.  So dendro-chronological conclusions tend to be expressed as a "terminus post quem" or an earliest possible date, with a tentative estimate of an actual date, that may be twenty or more years later.

The  so-called ''Panel Paintings Initiative'' is a multi-year project in collaboration between the Getty Conservation Institute, the [[Getty Foundation]], and the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. The Panel Paintings Initiative is a response to the growing recognition that significant collections of paintings on wood panels may be at risk in coming decades due to the waning numbers of conservators and craftspeople with the highly specialized skills required for the conservation of these complex works of art.&lt;ref&gt;More information on the objectives of the project can be found on [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wood==
Artists would typically use wood native to the region. [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), for example, painted on [[Populus|poplar]] when he was in Venice and on oak when in the Netherlands and southern Germany. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) used [[oak]] for his paintings in France; Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5–1545) and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] (1497/8–1543) used oak while working in southern Germany and England. In the Middle Ages, spruce and lime were used in the Upper Rhine and often in Bavaria. Outside of the Rhineland, softwood (such as pinewood) was mainly used. Of a group of twenty Norwegian altar frontals from the Gothic period (1250–1350) fourteen were made of fir, two of oak, and four of pine (Kaland 1982). Large altars made in Denmark during the fifteenth century used oak for the figures as well as for the painted wings. Lime was popular with [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (ca. 1480–1538), [[Baldung Grien]], [[Christoph Amberger]] (d. 1562), Dürer, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553). Cranach often used [[beech]] wood—an unusual choice. In Northern Europe, poplar is very rarely found, but [[walnut]] and [[chestnut]] are not uncommon. In the northeast and south, coniferous trees such as [[spruce]], and various types of [[fir]], and [[pine]] have been used. Fir wood is shown to have been used in the Upper and Middle Rhine, [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Saxony]]. Pinewood was used mainly in [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] and beech wood only in [[Saxony]]. However, in general, oak was the most common substrate used for panel making in the [[Low Countries]], northern Germany, and the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]]. In France, until the seventeenth century, most panels were made from oak, although a few made of walnut and poplar have been found.

The oak favored as a support by the painters of the northern school was, however, not always of local origin. In the seventeenth century about four thousand full-grown oak trees were needed to build a medium-sized merchant ship; thus, imported wood was necessary. Oak coming from Königsberg as well as [[Gdańsk]] is often found among works by Flemish and Dutch artists from the 15th through the 17th centuries - the origin can be established by the patterns of [[growth ring]]s. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, [[Wilhelmus Beurs]], a Dutch writer on painting techniques, considered oak to be the most useful wooden substrate on which to paint. However, exceptions are seen rather early in the seventeenth century: sometimes walnut, [[pear]]wood, [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], or Indian woods were used. [[Mahogany]] was already in use by a number of painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century and was used often in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century. Even so, when canvas or copper was not used, the main oeuvre of the northern school was painted on oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Wadum pp.149-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Integration-Teaching-Multicultural-Settings/dp/0132565560|title=Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter through the Arts in Multicultural Settings|last=Goldberg|first=Merryl|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780132565561|edition=4|location=Boston|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for [[motor skill]]s and [[Psychosocial|psychosocial skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/18985575/childrens-developmental-benchmarks-and-stages|title=Children's Developmental Benchmarks and Stages|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student [[Self-expression values|self-expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/vp/cf/|title=Curriculum Frameworks - Visual &amp; Performing Arts (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of [[arts integration]] because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Emergent-Bilingual-Youth-Culturally/dp/0415509742|title=The Arts and Emergent Bilingual Youth: Building Culturally Responsive, Critical and Creative Education in School and Community Contexts|last=Chappell|first=Sharon Verner|last2=Faltis|first2=Christian J.|date=2013-04-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415509749|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts-based life situations, including [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Teaching-Integrating-Understanding-Curriculum/dp/0807750808|title=Artful Teaching: Integrating the Arts for Understanding Across the Curriculum, K-8|last=Donahue|first=David M.|date=2010-06-02|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807750803|editor-last=Stuart|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York; Reston, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performing arts integration out of schools'''

Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorliewski|first=Julie|last2=Porfilio|first2=Brad|year=2012|title=Revolutionizing Environmental Education through Indigenous Hip Hop Culture|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=17|pages=46–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issues of access and equity'''

Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Discipline-based performing arts==

The performing arts differ from the [[plastic arts]] insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] by special [[clothing]], [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc.

For students pursuing elite [[profession]]al [[career]]s in performing arts like [[classical ballet]] and [[circus]] arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The breadth of areas covered by the performing arts is wide, including:
*[[Acting]]
**[[Comedy]]
**[[Drama]]
**[[Magic (illusion)|Magic]]
**[[Film]]
**[[Opera]]
**[[Theatre]]
*[[Music]]
**[[Busking]]
**[[Opera]]
*[[Dance]]
*[[Circus skills]]
**[[Acrobatics]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Puppy pregnancy syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] illness in humans brought on by [[mass hysteria]].

The syndrome is thought to be localized to villages in several states of [[India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], and [[Chhattisgarh]], and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Medicine challenges Indian superstition | newspaper = Deutsche Welle World | date = December 31, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|first=Shaikh Azizur |last=Rahman|url=http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

People suffering from this condition believe that shortly after being bitten by a dog, puppies are conceived within their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt; This is said to be especially likely if [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|the dog is sexually excited]] at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name="Scientific"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bering | first = Jesse | title = Puppy Pregnancy Syndrome: Men Who Think They Are Pregnant with Dogs | publisher = Scientific American | date = November 15, 2011  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2011/11/15/puppy-pregnancy-syndrome-men-who-are-pregnant-with-dogs/ | accessdate = March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are said to bark like dogs, and have reported being able to see the puppies inside them when looking at water, or hear them growling in their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite news | last = Achin | first = Kurt | title = Bizarre Medical Myth Persists In Rural India | newspaper =Voice of America | date = March 26, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bizarre-medical-myth-persists-in-rural-india-143818636/179310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the victims will eventually die – especially men, who will give birth to their puppies through the penis.&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

[[Witch doctors]] offer oral cures, which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient".&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-[[rabies]] medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt; This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

Some psychiatrists believe that the syndrome meets the criteria for a [[Culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound disorder]].&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

'''''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire''''', also known as '''''Cossacks of Saporog Are Drafting a Manifesto''''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Запорожці пишуть листа турецькому султану), is a painting by Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ilya Yefimovich Repin {{!}} Russian painter|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ilya-Yefimovich-Repin|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; artist [[Ilya Repin]]. The 2.03&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;inch) by 3.58&amp;nbsp;m (11&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891.  Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] bought the painting for 35,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting.  Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the [[State Russian Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

==Context==
[[File:Sultan_Mehmed_IV_(2).jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed IV]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] 1648–87]]
''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of [[Cossack]]s sending a reply to an ultimatum of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmed IV]]. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today [[Dnipro]]), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]] (1855-1940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter [[Ilya Repin]]. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies.{{cn|date = April 2014}}

According to the story, the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (from 'beyond the rapids', Ukrainian: ''za porohamy''), inhabiting the lands around the lower [[Dnieper River]] in [[Ukraine]], had defeated [[Ottoman Empire]] forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Turkish rule. The Cossacks, led by [[Ivan Sirko]], replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: "All that [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] wrote about them is true! A holy people! No one in the world held so deeply freedom, equality, and fraternity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoukes.com/history/cossack_letter/
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:

As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians - I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.

--Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes, parodying the Sultan's titles:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!

O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons; we have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee, fuck thy mother.

Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, [[Podolia|Podolian]] thief, [[catamite]] of Tartary, hangman of [[Kamenets-Podolsky|Kamyanets]], and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow, screw thine own mother!

So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord, the day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!

- [[Kosh otaman|Koshovyi otaman]] [[Ivan Sirko]], with the whole [[Zaporozhian Host]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While working on the original version, [[Ilya Repin|Repin]] in 1889 began work on a second version. This work he never finished. The second version of "The Cossacks" the artist tried to make more "historically authentic". In 1932 it was presented by the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] to the {{ill|Kharkiv Historical Museum|ru|Харьковский исторический музей}}. In 1935, it was moved to the {{ill|Kharkiv Art Museum|ru|Харьковский художественный музей|fr|Musée d'art de Kharkov|de|Kunstmuseum Charkiw}}, where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version. [[Vladimir Gilyarovsky]], a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was one of the models who posed for Repin.

:* This versified version of the letter has been set to music by the French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]], who composed a whole [[oratorio]] on ''[[La Chanson du mal-aimé]]'' for soloists, choir and orchestra (1953).

A '''rubbing''' (''[[Frottage (art)|frottage]]'') is a reproduction of the [[Surface finish|texture]] of a surface created by placing a piece of paper or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly [[charcoal]] or [[pencil]], but also various forms of blotted and rolled ink, [[chalk]], [[wax]], and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the  technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowsky, D., ''Failure Analysis of Wood and Wood-Based Products'', McGraw-Hill Education; 1st edition (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-07-183937-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses for this technique include:
* [[Brass rubbing]], to make copies of [[monumental brass]]es
* [[Forensic]] uses, including finding out what was written on a sheet of paper removed from a pad by rubbing the impressions left on subsequent sheets or other backing materials
* [[Frottage (art)|Frottage]], a [[surrealist]] art form
* [[Stone rubbing]], to make copies of patterns and inscriptions of gravestones or other incised or textured stone surfaces

'''Scottish Ballet''' is the national ballet company of Scotland and one of the four leading ballet companies of the United Kingdom, alongside the [[Royal Ballet]], [[English National Ballet]] and [[Birmingham Royal Ballet]].  Founded in 1969,&lt;ref name="West_in_OD_of_D"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/about-us/company/history|title=scottishballet.co.uk|author1=|first=|author2=|publisher=Scottish Ballet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company is based in [[Glasgow]], the resident ballet company at the Glasgow [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] and from 2009 in their purpose-built ballet centre in [[Tramway (arts centre)|Tramway Arts Centre, Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Move_to_Tramway&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-news/scottish-ballet-shifts-base-tramway-3080852 |title=Scottish Ballet shifts base to Tramway hub |date=17 July 2009 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515213905/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-news/scottish-ballet-shifts-base-tramway-3080852 |archivedate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by [[Peter Darrell]] and Elizabeth West as the '''Western Theatre Ballet''' in [[Bristol]] in 1957,&lt;ref name=West_in_OD_of_D/&gt; the company moved to Glasgow in 1969 and was renamed Scottish Theatre Ballet, changing to Scottish Ballet in 1974. A year later its home theatre became the Theatre Royal, Glasgow when Scottish Opera bought it and transformed it as the first national opera house in Scotland. The Company performs across Scotland, the UK and abroad, with strong classical technique at the root of all of its work.  Its broad repertory includes new versions of the classics, seminal pieces from the 20th century modern ballet canon, signature pieces by living choreographers and new commissions. As a national company, Scottish Ballet performs at theatres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness and in smaller venues throughout Scotland. The company's long history of touring internationally includes visits to China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Portugal, Ireland and the rest of the UK. Scottish Ballet's many recent awards include the 2004 [[TMA Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in Dance in recognition of its modernisation programme and dynamic performances. Scottish Ballet's current artistic director [[Christopher Hampson]] joined the company in 2012.

Scottish Ballet is Scotland's national dance company. Its primary aim is to provide programmes of world-class dance performance and educational activity at all scales. Scottish Ballet presents a wide range of dance to audiences across Scotland, the UK and abroad – and employs 36 professional dancers, 41 staff and a part-time freelance orchestra of up to 70 musicians.

The Company provides dance classes and a variety of education initiatives, including work with children and adults of all ages and abilities, and the Associate Programme which encourages aspiring young dancers to train for a career in the industry. Scottish Ballet also  has close links with Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, partnering the BA Modern Ballet and M.Mus (Pianist for Dance) degree courses.

Scottish Ballet was the first dance company in Europe to offer live audio description for the visually impaired, and maintains a programme of regular audio described performances throughout Scotland.&lt;ref name="scottishballet.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/about-us/company/artistic-vision|title=Our Legacy - Scottish Ballet|website=Scottish Ballet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
A storyboard artist visualizes stories and sketches frames of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/10672637/Britains-coolest-jobs-the-Hollywood-storyboard-artist.html|title=Britain's coolest jobs: the Hollywood storyboard artist|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quick pencil drawings and marker renderings are two of the most common traditional techniques, although nowadays [[Adobe Flash]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Storyboard Pro]], and other storyboard applications are often used. The digital camera is one of the latest techniques in creating storyboards. 

Most storyboard artists nowadays begin and finish their work on computers using software and digital pencils or a [[graphics tablet]]. Storyboard artists may use photos to create visuals where [[stock photos]] or photos taken specifically for the project are put together digitally to produce a photographic representation called a photovisual. 

For motion pictures, some filmmakers, directors, and producers choose to use clip-art computer programs designed to create storyboards, or use a dedicated 3D storyboarding software, or a more multi-purpose 3D program which can also be used to create elements of the storyboards.

== Industry specific work ==
Storyboard artists have different goals in different industries.

=== Advertising ===
In advertising, the storyboard artist can be called upon to create a representation of what the finished TV commercial, or spot, will look like in order to persuade and engage the client to buy the concept being pitched. This can either be at the time the agency is trying to win the client's business or once the client has signed on with the agency. In either case, the important element is for the storyboards to visualize for the client what the agency's creative director or "creatives" are thinking will sell the client's product. A storyboard artist may also be asked to visually represent several versions of a campaign for print ads.

=== Live-action film ===
In live-action film, a storyboard artist is hired at the beginning of a project. When a storyboard artist is hired by a motion picture company, the artist must break down the scenes of the script into shots which can be filmed. This is done under the supervision of the film's director in order to ensure the director's vision from the start of the project. As the production proceeds, the storyboards are presented to the cinematographer who is then responsible for bringing that vision to the screen. 

Film production companies may also hire a storyboard artist to create polished presentation-style storyboards (which might also include sound) which can be used by an executive producer to raise the money to create the film.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Animation ===
In animation, projects are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone (that is, a screenplay may not be written until later), and storyboard artists continue to work throughout the production to develop particular sequences. After a sequence is edited the director and/or storyboard artist and team may need to rework the sequence as it becomes evident that changes need to be made for timing and story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles_and_stories/job_roles/349_storyboard_artist_animation|title=Storyboard Artist (Animation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4975">'''Symphony No. 2 in E minor''' was written by [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] between 1945 and 1946. After quitting his conducting posts in Germany and Austria in protest at Nazi cultural policy, Furtwängler moved to Switzerland, where he wrote this symphony. It is in four movements:

# Assai moderato - Allmählich belebend (bis Allegro) - Von hier ab festes Tempo (Allegro)
# Andante semplice (Tranquillo) (in [[C major]]) &lt;ref&gt;key: p.104 (first page of 2nd movement) of 1952 score (see below): movement starts on a low C, main theme goes: G E A D-EF EF G. The sound is a clear C major.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Un poco moderato - Più Allegro - Più Moderato - Allegro - Moderato - Allegro (movement is in [[A minor]])
# Langsam - Moderato andante - Allegro molto - Moderato - Langsam - Moderato - Presto

The symphony is scored for [[Piccolo]],&lt;ref&gt;Appears during the finale, but - unusually given publication conventions - not mentioned, in the 1952 score, at the beginning of the finale or that of the score.&lt;/ref&gt; 3 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], 3 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, double-bassoon, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]] (tamtam), and [[string instrument|strings]].

The outer movements are in [[sonata form]], with some related material.&lt;ref&gt;Very noticeably, the climax toward the end of the finale - just before the last few pages - is an extension of that of the development section in the first movement.&lt;/ref&gt; The third movement, which follows the second movement without pause ("attacca Scherzo!")&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Studienpartitur'' (student score) published by Brucknerverlag, Wiesbaden in 1952, page 134.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[scherzo]] with trio. Unlike Bruckner, Furtwängler makes smooth transitions into and out of the trio.

Like Furtwängler's other symphonic works, the Symphony No. 2 is very rarely performed. Roughly 80 minutes in length, the work is heavily indebted to the [[Romanticism (music)|late-Romantic]] style of composers like [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. As conductor/musicologist [[Christopher Fifield]] has observed, most of Furtwängler's works "are of Brucknerian length but, devoid of Brucknerian genius, few have the material to sustain such proportions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Fifield|Fifield, Christopher]], "Relationships", ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 131, No. 1770 (Aug., 1990), p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
However, the symphony has strong advocates: [[Eugen Jochum]] recorded the work with the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in 1954, and there is another recording made by [[Daniel Barenboim]] conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Rob (2002). July 5 "The Compact Collection: Birtwistle: 'The Woman and the Hare' and other works - The Nash Ensemble/ Martyn Brabbins; Furtwängler: Symphony No 2 - Chicago SO/Daniel Barenboim" ''The Independent On Sunday''&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least two other recordings besides those conducted by the composer, though in complete cycles of his symphonies.&lt;ref&gt;On the Marco Polo and Arte Nova record labels.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Honegger]] wrote of this work, "The man who can write a score as rich as [this] is not to be argued about.  He is of the race of great musicians."&lt;ref&gt;Translated into English from: Topakian, Stéphane (1992). ''[http://www.furtwangler.net/doc/honegger.pdf Furtwängler et Honegger]'' (PDF). ''Société Wilhelm Furtwängler'' newsletter, July 1992. Accessed from the [http://www.furtwangler.net/man.html Furtwängler Society homepage].  Topakian suggests that Honegger may have known the symphony from Furtwängler's 1952 recording, though of course his acquaintance with the conductor himself went back rather further and indeed, Honegger dedicated his Mouvement symphonique Nº 3 to Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic, as Topakian notes in his article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furtwängler himself recorded his Symphony No. 2 in a studio with the Berlin Philharmonic in December 1951. There also exist several public recordings, some of them having been released : with the Hamburg Philharmonic in 1948 (Société Wilhelm Furtwängler), with the Orchestra of Hesse Radio in Frankfurt in 1952 (Wilhelm-Furtwängler-Gesellschaft), with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1953 (Orfeo) and with the South-German Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stuttgart in 1954 (Mediaphon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fischer.hosting.paran.com/music/Furtwangler/furtwangler-discography-2.htm#Furtwangler Wilhelm Fürtwangler's discography]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two '''Taşçı reliefs''' are [[rock relief]]s from the time of the [[Hittite empire]]. They are two kilometres south of {{ill|Taşçı, Develi|lt=Taşçı|tr}} in [[Develi]] district, [[Kayseri Province]], Turkey. They are known in Turkish as ''Yazılı Kaya'' ("Inscribed cliffs").  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
At Taşçı the Zamantı Irmağı river is met by the Şamaz Dere river (also known as the Homur Suyu), which has its source at Bakırdağ to the south. At this spot the river passes through a narrow gorge with steep cliffs on either side; the two reliefs known as Taşçı A and B are on the left bank, les than a hundred metres apart. No travel route can have passed through the gorge at the time when the reliefs were created, since the creation of the modern road required advanced stone blasting work. This, the location by the water, and the presence of caves above the reliefs suggests the site had a ritual function.

== Taşçı A ==
[[File:Tasci6.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Setting of Taşçı A from the opposite bank]]
[[File:Tasci1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Detail of Taşçı A: the three figures and the inscription]]
The north relief, Taşçı A, lies near the bank, about two metres above the water level, and now rises less than a metre above the soil which has built up around about. On the right hand side, it shows three robed figures facing right, who are covered by soil up to their hips. Their outlines are marked with depp grooves. The left figure is the best preserved - he is the only one where internal details can be made out. Ribbons run over their heads, a cloth hangs over their backs; from these details the figure appears to be female. Her eyes and chin are still visible, the nose and mouth area is broken. The two left figures each extend an arm; according to the 1939 sketch by [[Ignace Gelb]], the right figure had the same posture, but this cannot be seen any more on account of heavy weathering. The central and right figures, who wear round caps, are only visible as silhouettes. All three figures are generally interpreted as priests.

Above the heads are inscriptions in [[Luwian hieroglyphs]]; the symbols on the left can be grouped together, while the symbols on the right are not preserved. Their poor condition makes them difficult to read. Only the name of the left, female figure can be read, as "Ma-na-a-za/i". She is further identified as the "daughter of Lubakkis, the son of the military scribe." Another group of hieroglyphs are located to the left of the three figures, which name another person - [[John David Hawkins]] reads "Bodyguard Zida, servant of [[Hattusili III|Hattusili]], the Great King, the hero." This Zida is not depicted, but he is probably the creator of the relief.

== Taşçı B ==
[[File:Tasci5.jpg|thumb|vertical|Setting of Taşçı B on the west bank]]
[[File:Tasci4.jpg|thumb|vertical|Taşçı B]]
Less than 100 metres upstream is Taşçı B on a boulder which is right on the bank and is covered by water when the water level is high. The relief depicts a male figure facing right. He wears a round cap with a horn, the long robes of a priest and a stole which hangs over his shoulders. His right hand is held in pose of greeting, his left is stretched out. A holy symbol which is reserved for actual gods can be seen above. Three hieroglyphs below his arms have been read in differing ways by different researcher, but his name cannot be made out.

== Interpretation ==
There is a cave in the cliff-face above Taşçı A, from which a shaft descends vertically. It is now filled with soil, but it probably reached the water level. There is also a cave in the cliff face behind Taşçı B, with a similar shaft. The two caves and the location of the reliefs by the water suggest that the place had a ritual function. The orientation of the priestly figure upstream, in the direction of the fields at water level suggests that they performed a protective role for the surrounding area and for a (presumed) settlement in the area.

The reliefs are dated to around the 13th century BC by their inscriptions.

== Research history ==
A short description and first reading of Taşçı A were published by Hans Rott and [[Leopold Messerschmidt]] after Rott's visit to Anatloia in 1906. [[Guillaume de Jerphanion]] produced another account in the same year. [[Ignace Gelb]] uncovered the lower part of the relief in 1935 and published a sketch and a photograph. Taşçı B was first described by [[Sedat Alp]] and [[Ekrem Akurgal]] in 1947. Subsequently, [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]] visited the place in 1954. The first published account of both reliefs was produced by [[Piero Meriggi]] in 1975, after his first trip to Anatolia. His understanding of the inscriptions agreed closely with that of Gelb, unlike the work of [[Franz Steinherr]] published in the same year. The latter was followed by [[Markus Wäfler]]. Another account was published by [[Kay Kohlmeyer]] in 1983 and finally [[Horst Ehringhaus]] published a description in 2003.

'''''The Crowning of the Virtuous Hero''''' is a painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], painted between 1613 and 1614. Unsigned, it was commissioned by the St George Guild of Archers in [[Antwerp]] for their banqueting hall and is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister within the [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in [[Kassel]].

==Description==
It shows an ancient Roman general being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with laurels of victory and treading underfoot a bound barbarian and a personification of Discord (shown with snakes for hair). To his right is a [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of Harmony, who presents him with a bound bundle of arrows (symbolising peace). The figure on the right is also intended as the guardian of religion, due to the eternal fire shown on the altar beside the figure. Behind the altar is a red and white tricolour, referring to the ruling [[house of Habsburg]] and thus affirming the guild's loyalty to that house.

==History==
[[William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] acquired the painting between 1730 and 1760 to add to his collection of Dutch paintings at the Schloss Bellevue in Kassel's Oberneustadt or upper new town. The [[Peace of Tilsit]] in 1807 made Kassel the capital of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], under [[Jerome Bonaparte]] - later that year Jerome's brother [[Napoleon I]] acquired the painting and assigned it to the imperial coronation hall in Paris. In 1813 general Czerniczew forced Jerome Bonaparte to flee and negotiations began for the return of this and other paintings confiscated by Napoleon. [[Jacob Grimm]] (then a legation secretary) played an instrumental part in gaining the return of the Rubens, which occurred in December 1815.

Between 1878 and 1943, the painting was in the Neue Galerie at the Schloss Bellevue. In 1943 the painting was moved to a store elsewhere - Kassel was a target for Allied bombing and the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe was severely damaged. In 1956 the painting was moved to emergency headquarters of the Landesmuseum until in April 1974 it returned to Kassel, initially in the Corps de Logis at the Schloss  Wilhelmshöhe.

The title, ''The Elephant in the Dark'', is from the traditional [[Orient|Eastern]] [[fable]] of the [[blind men and an elephant]], in which different people experience an elephant differently according to their [[Subjectivity|subjectivities]]. Award-winning writer and later winner of the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Doris Lessing]] writes that it is used here to refer to “the long interaction between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], even during the thousand years we were at war or hostile: sometimes in secret and kept out of the knowledge of rulers and court; sometimes with the aid of the said rulers; sometimes – and much more than we know – open and thriving, but since fallen into oblivion, or concealed because such amity was a threat to the machinery of national hostilities ...”&lt;ref name="TEITD"&gt;{{cite book

Shah gives examples of the interlocking history of Christianity and Islam, starting from the life and times of the prophet [[Muhammad]], through the [[Middle Ages]], and up to the present day. His method is to show where scholars from East and West have unearthed important materials, and then to illustrate large and complex themes by exemplary [[anecdote]]s or quotations instead of lengthy [[exegesis]] or dry [[intellectualism]]. As a result, Lessing says, books like this one by Shah are “a salutary reminder as to what is possible in scholarly writing: it is admirable above all for its economy, its elegant pithiness. When you have finished with even a little book, like this one, you find yourself in possession of the necessary basic information.”&lt;ref name="TEITD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LessingNewSociety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeBites" /&gt;

Shah emphasizes that both Christians and Muslims need to learn more about each other. In the case of Muslims, respect for Christianity is built into the foundations of Islam in the [[Quran]], and [[Jesus]] is regarded as a pillar of their religion. Muhammad himself lay down the foundations of respect for Christianity both by [[precept]] and by example, although there was a difference between what he taught and what his successors made of it. Christians in the West, on the other hand, have been much more lacking in accurate information about, and appreciation for, Islam.&lt;ref name="TEITD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LessingNewSociety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeBites" /&gt;

Shah provides an exposition of the basic [[Arabic]] [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|triconsonantal root]] “[[Š-L-M|SLM]]” and its associated word groupings: Islam, Muslim, Salem, salaam, and so on, to explain: “It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of this constellation of terms and meanings; for the [[Arabs|Arab]] speaker they constitute a constant reminder of the diverse aspects of their [[religion]] and its meanings, and a permanent facility for confirming these concepts without having to rely only upon interpretation by later [[Ideology|ideologists]].”&lt;ref name="TEITD" /&gt;

He also uses illustrations taken from the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mysticism|mystical]] tradition; for instance, [[Al-Ghazali]]'s tale of the Seven Valleys, accepted by both Muslims and Christians as a map or a guide of the journey to [[God]].&lt;ref name="TEITD" /&gt;

Shah's previous books on Sufism illustrated that there are many ways of approaching mysticism, including secular and [[Physicalism|physicalist]] frameworks, while this book illustrates the “religious road to that place where all the ways lead – surrender, submission.”&lt;ref name="LessingNewSociety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeBites" /&gt;

==Reception==
In 1974, Doris Lessing writes in ''[[New Society]]'': “This book aims at redressing balances; and to say what we have in common, on what we can build”&lt;ref name="LessingNewSociety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeBites" /&gt; and that it “seems to be essential at a time when [...] the two religions which have shaped our respective cultures are engaged in deliberate and self-conscious attempts to overcome barriers which humanity can no longer afford.”&lt;ref name="LessingNewSociety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeBites" /&gt;

Also in 1974, [[Edward Campbell (journalist)|Edward Campbell]], literary editor of ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'' writes that “Shah seems to suggest that the time is ripe for a true [[ecumenism]]”&lt;ref name="EveningNews" /&gt; in which “Christianity and Islam, each preserving its essential nature, might recognise the validity of a union, if not of doctrine, at least of spirit,”&lt;ref name="EveningNews"&gt;{{cite news

It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833&lt;ref name="british"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3097579&amp;partId=1 | title = Kanagawa-oki nami-ura 神奈川沖浪裏 (Under the Wave off Kanagawa) | accessdate = 2010-07-19 | publisher = [[British Museum]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122356/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3097579&amp;partId=1 | archivedate = 2014-12-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late [[Edo period]] as the first print in Hokusai's series ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''. It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable works of Japanese art in the world.

The image depicts an enormous [[Wind wave|wave]] threatening three boats off the coast of the town of [[Kanagawa-juku|Kanagawa]] (the present-day city of [[Yokohama, Kanagawa|Yokohama]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]) while Mount Fuji rises in the background. While sometimes assumed to be a [[tsunami]], the wave is more likely to be a large [[rogue wave]].&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; As in many of the prints in the series, it depicts the area around [[Mount Fuji]] under particular conditions, and the mountain itself appears in the background.

Original impressions of the print are in many Western collections, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/learn/schools-resources/asian-art2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421114928/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/learn/schools-resources/asian-art2 |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|Claude Monet's home]] in [[Giverny]], France, among many other collections.

Hokusai began painting when he was six years old. At age twelve, his father sent him to work at a booksellers. At sixteen, he was apprenticed as an engraver and spent three years learning the trade. At the same time he began to produce his own illustrations. At eighteen he was accepted as an apprentice to [[Katsukawa Shunshō]], one of the foremost [[ukiyo-e]] artists of the time.

In 1804 he became famous as an artist when, during a [[matsuri|festival]] in Tokyo, he completed a 240m² painting&lt;ref name="epdlp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epdlp.com/pintor.php?id=2884 | title = Katsushika Hokusai | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101105012724/http://epdlp.com/pintor.php?id=2884 | archivedate = 2010-11-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Buddhist]] monk named [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]]. In 1814, he published the first of fifteen volumes of sketches entitled ''[[Hokusai manga|Manga]]''. His ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', from which ''The Great Wave'' comes, was produced from {{circa|1830}}.&lt;ref name="Calza"&gt;{{harvnb|Calza|2003|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixteenth century fantastic depictions of waves crashing on rocky shores were painted on [[Byōbu|folding screens]] known as "rough seas screens" (''ariso byōbu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guth|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{year missing|date=May 2018}}{{efn|A "rough sea screen" features in one of Hokusai's earliest works, [[:File:Segawa_Kikunojo_III_--_Hokusai.jpg|''Segawa Kikunojo III as Masamune's Daughter, Oren'']], printed over fifty years before the ''Great Wave''}}
Hokusai drew many waves throughout his career; the genesis of the ''Great Wave'' can be traced back over thirty years. The combination of wave and mountain was inspired by an oil painting by [[Shiba Kōkan]], an artist strongly influenced by the [[Western art]], particularly Dutch paintings, he had seen at Nagasaki, the only port open to foreigners in this period.&lt;ref name="Forrer 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Forrer|2003|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kōkan's ''A View of Seven-League Beach'' was executed in middle of 1796 and exhibited publicly at the [[Atago Shrine (Tokyo)|Atago shrine in Shiba]]. Hokusai's print ''Springtime at Enoshima'', which he contributed to ''The Willow Branch'' poetry anthology published in 1797, is clearly derived from Kōkan's work, although the wave in Hokusai's version rises noticeably higher.&lt;ref name="Forrer 26"&gt;{{harvnb|Forrer|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Closer compositionally to the ''Great Wave'' are two previous prints by Hokusai: ''Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu'' ({{circa|1803}}) and ''Oshiokuri Hato Tsusen no Zu'', ({{circa|1805}})&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagata|Bester|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both works have subjects identical to the ''Great Wave'': a sailboat and a rowboat respectively. In both precursor works, the subjects are in the midst of a storm, beneath a great wave that threatens to devour them. An analysis of the differences between the two works and the ''Great Wave'' demonstrates the artistic and technical development of Hokusai:&lt;ref name="soundfury"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thesoundsinsidemyhead.blogspot.com/2008/05/hokusais-great-wave.html | title = Hokusai's Great Wave | date = 2010-07-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831012345/http://thesoundsinsidemyhead.blogspot.com/2008/05/hokusais-great-wave.html | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the earlier two designs the waves appear to be dense and uniform; they almost seem to be minerals. Their rigidity and verticality evoke the shape of a snow-capped mountain, while in the ''Great Wave'' the wave stands out because it is more active, dynamic, and aggressive, which makes it threatening.
* The earlier images are very marked by the perspective traditionally used in Japanese painting, where the viewer sees the scene from a bird's-eye view. The ''Great Wave'', on the other hand, is depicted in a more western perspective, giving the feeling that the wave will break on top of the viewer.
* In the earlier prints the horizon is in the middle, whereas in the ''Great Wave'' the horizon is so low that it forces the viewer's eye to the very center of the action.
* In the first two, there is a sail boat on the crest of the wave, as if it had managed to escape. Hokusai eliminated this element for the ''Great Wave'', because it interfered with the dynamic of the curve or to make the image more dramatic.
* The two first prints have an uneven composition, lacking consistency, whereas the ''Great Wave'' only has two important masses: the wave itself, and the vanishing point beneath the wave.
* The wave shows the level of control that Hokusai had reached. The image, although simple in its design is, however, the result of a long process, a methodical reflection. The basis of this method were laid out by Hokusai in his 1812 work ''Quick lessons of simplified drawing,'' in which he explains that every object can be drawn using the relationship of the circle and square.

=== Description ===

This print is a [[List of ukiyo-e terms|''yoko-e'']], that is, a [[landscape format]] produced to the ''ōban'' size, about 25&amp;nbsp;cm high by 37&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/JP1847 | title = Katsushika Hokusai: The Great Wave at Kanagawa | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614065800/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/jp1847 | archivedate = 2010-06-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] comprises three main elements: the sea whipped up by a storm, three boats and a mountain. It includes the signature in the upper left-hand corner.

==== The mountain ====
{{further|Mount Fuji}}

The mountain with a snow-capped peak is [[Mount Fuji]], which in Japan is considered sacred and a symbol of national identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fujiarts.com/cgi-bin/item.pl?item=56389 | title = Under the Wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave) by Hokusai (1760–1849) | accessdate = 2010-07-10 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711053740/http://www.fujiarts.com/cgi-bin/item.pl?item=56389 | archivedate = 2011-07-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a symbol of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia35/es/topic/index.html | title = El Monte Fuji como Objeto Artístico |accessdate=7 July 2010 |language= Spanish|author=Nipponia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Fuji is an iconic figure in many Japanese representations of famous places (''[[meisho-e]]''), as is the case in Hokusai's series of ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', which opens with the present scene.

The dark color around Mount Fuji seems to indicate that the scene occurs early in the morning, with the sun rising from behind the observer, illuminating the mountain's snowy peak. While [[cumulonimbus]] storm clouds seem to be hanging in the sky between the viewer and Mount Fuji, no rain is to be seen either in the foreground scene or on Mount Fuji, which itself appears completely cloudless.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cartwright| first1=HE | last2=Nakamura | first2=H | url= http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/02/23/rsnr.2007.0039.full | title = What kind of a wave is Hokusai's Great wave off Kanagawa? | accessdate=7 July 2010 | journal=Notes and Records | volume=63 | issue=2 | pages=119–135 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2007.0039 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boats ====
In the scene there are three ''oshiokuri-bune'', fast boats that are used to transport live fish&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Harbison|1997|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Izu Province|Izu]] and [[Bōsō Peninsula|Bōsō]] peninsulas to the markets of the [[Tokyo Bay|bay of Edo]]. As the name of the piece indicates the boats are in [[Kanagawa]] prefecture, with Tokyo to the north, Mt Fuji to the northwest, the bay of [[Sagami Bay|Sagami]] to the south and the bay of Tokyo to the east. The boats, oriented to the southeast, are returning to the capital.

There are eight rowers per boat, clinging to their oars. There are two more passengers in the front of each boat, bringing the total number of human figures in the image to thirty. Using the boats as reference, one can approximate the size of the wave: the ''oshiokuri-bune'' were generally between 12 and 15 meters long, and noting that Hokusai stretched the vertical scale by 30%, the wave must be between 10 and 12 meters tall.&lt;ref name="royal" /&gt;

==== Sea and waves ====

}}

The sea dominates the composition as an extending wave about to break. In the moment captured in this image, the wave forms a circle around the center of the design, framing Mount Fuji in the background.

[[Edmond de Goncourt]] described the wave in this way:

{{quote|The drawing of the wave is a deification of the sea made by a painter who lived with the religious terror of the overwhelming ocean completely surrounding his country; He is impressed by the sudden fury of the ocean's leap toward the sky, by the deep blue of the inner side of the curve, by the splash of its claw-like crest as it sprays forth droplets.&lt;ref name="radioUNAM"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiounam.unam.mx/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1130&amp;Itemid=55 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230510/http://www.radiounam.unam.mx/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1130&amp;Itemid=55 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 22 July 2011 | title = La Gran Ola de Kanagawa | accessdate = 7 July 2010 | language = Spanish | author = Radio UNAM | authorlink = Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andreas Ramos, a writer, notes:

{{quote|... a seascape with Fuji. The waves form a frame through which we see the mountain. The gigantic wave is a ''yin'' ''yang'' of empty space beneath the mountain. The inevitable breaking that we await creates a tension in the picture. In the foreground, a small wave forming a miniature Fuji is reflected by the distant mountain, itself shrunk in perspective. The little wave is larger than the mountain.  The small fishermen cling to thin fishing boats, slide on a sea-mount looking to dodge the wave. The violent ''Yang'' of nature is overcome by the ''yin'' of the confidence of these experienced fishermen. Strangely, despite a storm, the sun shines high.&lt;ref name="radioUNAM" /&gt;}}

==== Signature ====
[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa - Title and signature.jpg|thumb|left|80px|Hokusai's signature]]
''The Great Wave off Kanagawa'' has two inscriptions. The first, within a rectangular cartouche in the top-left corner is the series title: "冨嶽三十六景/神奈川冲/浪裏" ''Fugaku Sanjūrokkei / Kanagawa oki / nami ura'', which translates as "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji / Offshore from Kanagawa / Beneath the wave".
The second inscription, to the left, is the artist's signature: 北斎改爲一筆 ''Hokusai aratame Iitsu hitsu'', ("From the brush of Hokusai, changing his name to Iitsu").&lt;ref name="Guimet1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guimet.fr/HOKUSAI-Mad-about-his-art-From | title = Hokusai "Mad about his art" from Edmond de Goncourt to Norbert Lagane | accessdate = 7 July 2010 | author = [[Guimet Museum]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101014144021/http://www.guimet.fr/HOKUSAI-Mad-about-his-art-From | archivedate = 14 October 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his career, Hokusai used more than 30 different names, always beginning a new cycle of works by changing it, and letting his students use the previous name.

In his work ''Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji'' he used four distinct signatures, changing it according to the phase of the work: ''Hokusai aratame Iitsu hitsu'', ''zen Hokusai Iitsu hitsu'', ''Hokusai Iitsu hitsu'' and ''zen saki no Hokusai Iitsu hitsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://expositions.bnf.fr/japonaises/grand/083.htm | title = Hokusai, Les Trente-six vues du mont Fuji |accessdate=7 July 2010 |language=French |author=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
[[File:Ukiyo-e dsc04680.jpg|thumb|right|Block used to produce woodblock prints]]
In [[Japanese woodblock printing]] the artist's final preparatory sketch (''shita-e'') is taken to a ''horishi'', or block carver, who glues the thin ''[[washi]]'' paper to a block of wood, usually cherry,&lt;ref name="metwoodblock"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ukiy/hd_ukiy.htm | title = Woodblock Prints in the Ukiyo-e Style |accessdate=2010-07-05 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then carefully carves it away to form a relief of the lines of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colombia.emb-japan.go.jp/cultura/061010.htm | title = Ukiyo-e, arte de grabado japonés | accessdate = 2010-07-11 | language = Spanish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100419113623/http://www.colombia.emb-japan.go.jp/cultura/061010.htm | archivedate = 2010-04-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, the drawing is lost. Finally, with all the necessary blocks (usually one for each color),&lt;ref name="metwoodblock" /&gt; a ''surishi'', or printer, who places the printing paper on each block consecutively and rubs the back with a hand-tool known as a ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lagranepoca.com/articles/2010/05/22/4615.html | title = Ukiyo-e: Imágenes del mundo flotante | accessdate = 2010-07-11 | language = Spanish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101210013416/http://www.lagranepoca.com/articles/2010/05/22/4615.html | archivedate = 2010-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There could be a great number of impressions produced, sometimes thousands, before the blocks wore out.&lt;ref name="metwoodblock" /&gt;

Because of the nature of the production process, the final work was usually the result of a collaboration in which the painter generally did not participate in the production of the prints.&lt;ref name="guimet2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guimet.fr/Masterpieces-from-the-Ota-Memorial?var_recherche=Hokusai | title = Masterpieces from the Ota Memorial museum of Art Paintings and Japanese prints | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Musée Guimet]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720034557/http://www.guimet.fr/Masterpieces-from-the-Ota-Memorial?var_recherche=Hokusai | archivedate = 2011-07-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design uses only a small number of different color blocks. The water is rendered with three shades of blue;{{efn|In early prints of the ''Great Wave'' the key-block, usually only used for outlines, is simultaneously used to print the dark-blue areas of the waves.}} the boats are yellow;{{efn|The pale red seen on the sides of two of the boats in the frequently reproduced Metropolitan Museum print (JP 1847) has apparently been added by hand.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;}} a dark grey for the sky behind Fuji and on the boat immediately below; a pale grey in the sky above Fuji and on the foreground boat; pink clouds at the top of the image. "The block for these pink clouds seems to have been slightly abraded along parts of the edge to give a subtle gradated effect (''ita-bokashi'')".&lt;ref name=bm&gt;Clark (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though no law of [[intellectual property]] existed in Japan before the [[Meiji era]], there was still a sense of ownership and rights with respect to the blocks from which the prints were produced.{{efn|The concept of rights concerned with woodblock ownership was known as ''zōhan''.}} Rather than belonging to the artist, the blocks were considered the property of the ''hanmoto'' (publisher) or ''honya'' (publisher/bookseller) who could do with them as he wished. In some cases the blocks were sold or transferred to other publishers, in which case they became known as ''kyūhan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.viewingjapaneseprints.net/texts/topictexts/faq/faq_original.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080327112545/http://www.viewingjapaneseprints.net/texts/topictexts/faq/faq_original.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-03-27 | title = Viewing Japanese Prints: What Is an Original Woodblock Print? | accessdate = 2010-07-06 | publisher = ''Viewing Japanese Prints'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the series was very popular when it was produced, printing continued until the woodblocks started to show significant wear. It is likely that the original woodblocks printed around 5,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Private Life"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Society |first1=Infocobuild |title=Private Life of a Masterpiece: Episode 14 - Katsushika Hokusai: The Great Wave |url=http://www.infocobuild.com/books-and-films/art/PrivateLifeMasterpiece/episode-14.html |website=www.infocobuild.com |language=en|editor=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Given that many impressions have been lost, in wars, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters, few early impressions survive in which the lines of the woodblocks were still sharp at the time of printing.&lt;ref name="Private Life" /&gt; The remaining prints and subsequent reproductions vary considerably in quality and condition.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

The print is one of the most reproduced and most instantly recognized artworks in the world.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Japan ended a long period of national isolation and became open to imports from [[Western world|the West]]. In turn, much Japanese art came to Europe and America and quickly gained popularity. The influence of Japanese art on Western culture became known as [[Japonism]]. Japanese woodblock prints became a source of inspiration for artists in many genres, particularly the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]. Hokusai was seen as the emblematic Japanese artist and images from his prints and books influenced many different works.

[[Vincent van Gogh]], a great admirer of Hokusai, praised the quality of drawing and use of line in the ''Great Wave'', and said it had a terrifying emotional impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let676/letter.html|title=Letter 676: To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Saturday, 8 September 1888|publisher=Van Gogh Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French sculptor [[Camille Claudel]]'s ''La Vague'' (1897) replaces the boats in Hokusai's ''Great Wave'' with sea-nymphs.

The image inspired [[Claude Debussy]]'s orchestral work, ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', and appeared on the cover of the score's first edition published by [[Auguste Durand#A. Durand .26 fils|A. Durand &amp; Fils]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2014/debussy-la-mer |title= Hokusai and Debussy's Evocations of the Sea|date=July 22, 2014  |first=Michael|last= Cirigliano II|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australian]] artist [[Lin Onus]] used the ''Great Wave'' as the basis for his 1992 painting ''Michael and I are just slipping down the pub for a minute''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashcroft|first=Bill|date=2013-07-26|title=Hybridity and Transformation: The Art of Lin Onus|url=http://postcolonial.org/index.php/pct/article/view/1706|journal=Postcolonial Text|language=en|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An artistic work named ''Uprisings'' by Japanese/American Artist [[Kozyndan]] is based on the print, with the foam of the wave being replaced by bunnies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kozyndan.com/art/uprisings|title=Uprisings – Kozyndan|website=kozyndan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Incredulity of Saint Thomas''''' is a painting of the [[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas|subject of the same name]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Caravaggio]], c. 1601–1602. It is housed in the [[Sanssouci Picture Gallery]], now a museum, in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]].

It shows the episode that gave rise to the term "[[Doubting Thomas]]" which, formally known as the Incredulity of Thomas, had been frequently represented in Christian art since at least the 5th century, and used to make a variety of theological points. According to [[Gospel of John|St John's Gospel]], [[Thomas the Apostle]] missed one of [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Jesus's appearances to the Apostles after His resurrection]], and said "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it." {{Biblesource|John|20:25|NIV}} A week later Jesus appeared and told Thomas to touch Him and stop doubting. Then Jesus said, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." {{Biblesource|John|20:29|NIV}}

In the painting, Thomas's face shows surprise as Jesus holds his hand and guides it into the wound.&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite book|last1=García-Rivera|first1=Alex|title=A Wounded Innocence: Sketches for a Theology of Art|date=2003|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814651124|pages=120–123|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Wounded_Innocence.html?id=I6ILgMEpQJsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a halo emphasizes the corporeality of the risen Christ.&lt;ref&gt;http://diglib.library.vanderbilt.edu/act-imagelink.pl?RC=54170&lt;/ref&gt; The work is in [[chiaroscuro]].

This picture is probably related to ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'' (1602) and the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' (1603), all having a model in common.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It belonged to [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]] before entering the Prussian royal collection, surviving the Second World War intact.

A second version of "The Incredulity of Saint Thomas" has been re-discovered in [[Trieste]], Italy in a private collection.
It is published in the Maurizio Marini corpus catalogico "Caravaggio - Pictor praestantissimus" Newton &amp; Compton - 2005 in the position Q50. The painting is declared "d'interesse artistico e storico" by the "Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali Sopraintendenza Regionale del Fiuli - Venezia Giulia". Its authenticity has been attested by several experts including Maurizio Marini and [[Denis Mahon]] and confirmed by a court in Trieste.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''UnFrame''' collective is an independent resource of documentary photography exclusively managed by an international group of photographers dedicated to shining the spotlight on social, political and everyday issues that surround us. The collective was founded in February 2013 with the aim of developing and working on both long term social and political issues with a deeper perspective in addition to responding to news events as they happen anywhere in the world.

== Documented events ==
In 2013, during the first year of its activity, events documented were:

* The [[Rana Plaza]] building collapse in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[2013 protests in Turkey]].
* The consequences on civilians of the troubled political season in [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[Ukraine]] political crisis, the Kiev revolution ([[Euromaidan]]) and the Russian occupation of Crimea.

== Issues ==
The photographers have organized a collective archive of long term issues. Amongst others are the following:

* The aftermath of the [[Arab Spring]] in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].
* Three years of civil unrest and economic hardship in [[Italy]].
* The social consequences of the political division of [[Cyprus]].
* The social conditions of the [[Romani people|Roma]] in Europe.

Starting from September 2013 UnFrame self manages the collectives' growing archives in order to best facilitate the syndication of its work in the most efficient way possible. To this effect it has also partnered with key resource media outlets allowing for the distribution of its photographs including the French photo agency Cosmos.

'''''Unwanted Cinema''''' is a [[documentary film]] by Petrus van der Let and Armin Loacker that looks at the lives and careers of [[Jewish]] filmmakers in [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] during the 1930s after [[Hitler]] came to power. ''Unwanted Cinema'' features [[Henry Koster]], Felix Jackson, [[Joe Pasternak]], [[Otto Wallburg]], Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Rarsony, [[Hortense Raky]], Oskar Pilzer, Zolan Vidor, Ernst Verebes. The documentary shares clips from their films and interviews with their family.

==Summary==
On his American debut, director Henry Koster stood in the lobby waiting to see if the audience would laugh at his film. If they laughed, he knew he could make a career for himself. If they didn’t, he’d have to return to Europe, where he could be killed by the Nazis. The audience laughed uncontrollably. ''Unwanted Cinema'' profiles Koster and other Jews who were involved in the movie business before and during World War II, as they struggled to preserve both their careers and their lives.

Until the dawn of Hitler, Jewish actors and producers throughout [[Europe]] enjoyed critical acclaim and stardom. But once [[anti-Semitism]] began to spread, it threatened not only their celebrity but also their lives.  Filmmakers and actors moved to Vienna and Budapest where their “unwanted cinema” was produced independently. Later, in hopes of escaping war-torn Europe, many Jews involved in cinema traveled to [[Hollywood]] to test their skills and their luck.

The documentary points to both the cruelty and irony of anti-Semitism. Talent that was  “unwanted” in Europe because of prejudice was celebrated on the other side of the ocean. The charming clips interspersed throughout the documentary prove the injustice of rejecting Jewish talent. [[100 Men and a Girl]], which was nominated for five [[Oscars]], is just one example of the exceptional films that these [[refugees]] were responsible for.
